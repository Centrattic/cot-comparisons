And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether clipping nails at work makes the author an asshole. The friend clipped a nail because it was hanging and then did two more to even them out. Coworker B got upset, saying it was disgusting and demanded she stop. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, consider workplace norms. Some people might find nail clipping gross because it can create noise (snapping sounds) and debris (small bits of nail), which could be unsanitary. Coworker B was clearly bothered by it, even from 100 feet away. That's a strong reaction, but maybe justified if the noise was distracting.\n\nThen there's the friend's response. Saying \"chill out\" after being told it's gross might come off as dismissive. It didn't address the coworker's discomfort. If the friend had acknowledged the concern, maybe found a solution like doing it in a private space or using a tissue to catch bits, that could have been better.\n\nHowever, the initial act of clipping a hanging nail isn't inherently wrong. People have different habits. If the workplace doesn't have a policy against it, maybe it's not the friend's fault. But the follow-up actions\u2014clipping more nails and continuing despite the complaint\u2014might cross a line. The friend escalated by clipping two more, not just the one that was problematic, which could show a lack of consideration.\n\nAlso, the workplace environment matters. If it's an open office where noise and visibility are issues, the friend's actions could be more disruptive. But if it's a private cubicle, maybe less so. The key points are respect for others' comfort and whether the friend took steps to minimize disturbance. The friend didn't adjust her behavior after being asked, which is a problem.\n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong for continuing the action after being told it's an issue. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a policy or if it's a reasonable accommodation. Since there's no mention of policies, it's more about social etiquette. The friend's response was dismissive, so she's not fully in the right. But maybe coworker B overreacted. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the friend being at least partially at fault.\n"
