And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves Coworker B getting upset and confronting the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work is generally frowned upon because it can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. However, if someone has a long nail that's causing a problem, maybe it's understandable. The friend mentions a \"hanging nail,\" which might be a legitimate issue. But then she clips two more to \"even things out,\" which could be seen as unnecessary and maybe done for show, which could be annoying.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is strong\u2014calling it disgusting and hearing it from 100 feet away. That seems over the top, but maybe the sound of clippers is distracting. The author's response was \"chill out,\" which is dismissive. That might have escalated the situation. \n\nIs there a company policy against this? The scenario doesn't mention any, so maybe it's a gray area. However, the key point is whether the action itself is wrong. Clipping nails in a private cubicle isn't the same as doing it in a common area. But the noise might carry, so it's possible others are bothered. \n\nThe debate is between gross vs. acceptable. The friend's actions were in her cubicle, but the sound traveled. The friend might not be in the wrong if it was a quick fix for a problem, but doing extra could be seen as provocative. Coworker B's demand to stop suggests it's considered unhygienic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author should have considered others' sensitivities. Even if it's in her space, the noise affects others. Alternatively, Coworker B's reaction is extreme. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In many workplaces, nail clipping is discouraged. However, if the author did it quickly and not in a shared space, maybe it's not her fault. \n\nBut the fact that she clipped two more after being told to stop might be the issue. The initial act could be excused, but continuing after being asked could be seen as defiant. So maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't respect Coworker B's (and possibly others') discomfort. But the answer depends on whether the action itself is universally wrong or not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Coworker B is being overly sensitive. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the action isn't inherently wrong, but A if the author should have considered others' feelings. Hmm. It's tricky. I think it's a judgment call, but leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong because she continued after being asked and caused disruption.\n"
