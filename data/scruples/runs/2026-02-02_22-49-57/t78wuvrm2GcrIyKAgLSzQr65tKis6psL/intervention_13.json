And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about clipping nails at work and whether it's considered an asshole move. The friend cut a hanging nail and then clipped two more to even them out after being told not to do so by a coworker. The coworker was upset because she could hear the clipping from 100 feet away and found it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms in the workplace. Clipping nails might be seen as a personal hygiene task that's usually done at home. However, sometimes people might need to do quick fixes during the day if they have a problem like a hangnail. The initial act of clipping a problematic nail could be understandable. But then the friend clipped two more just to even them out. That might be where it crosses into being inconsiderate.\n\nThe coworker's reaction was strong\u2014she demanded the friend stop and was offended enough to send a text. The friend called her out for \"chilling out,\" which might not have been the best response. The key points are: the location (own cubicle vs. public space), the noise level, and whether the action was necessary.\n\nIf the friend was in her own cubicle, maybe it's less public, but if the sound is audible to others, it could still be disruptive. Clipping nails in an office isn't unheard of, but doing it in a way that's audible and causing discomfort might be inconsiderate. Also, adding two more after being told to stop could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's feelings.\n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong for continuing after being asked to stop and making the situation worse by doing more clipping. The coworker's reaction is valid if she finds it gross, but the friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive without acknowledging others' sensitivities. Therefore, the friend could be the asshole here.\n"
