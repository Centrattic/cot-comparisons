And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is the asshole. The situation involves some conflict between coworkers.\n\nFirst, the friend mentioned a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard and then confronted her, saying not to clip nails at work. The friend then clipped her nails in her cubicle, even clipping two more to \"even things out.\" Coworker B heard from over 100 feet away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Is clipping nails at work inherently gross or inappropriate? The friend didn't do it in a shared space; she did it in her own cubicle. However, the sound carried, which annoyed Coworker B. The friend's response was dismissive, which might have escalated the tension.\n\nOn one hand, everyone might need to clip nails occasionally, and doing it in a private workspace could be reasonable. On the other hand, the sound being disruptive and the friend's defensive reaction could be seen as inconsiderate. Coworker B's reaction seems over the top, but the friend's response might not have been the best approach.\n\nIs the friend in the wrong? It depends on the workplace culture. If there's no specific rule against it and she's in her own space, maybe not. But the fact that she clipped three nails after being told might have been unnecessary. The \"chill out\" response could be seen as dismissive. However, Coworker B's initial reaction was also strong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's in her own cubicle and it's a minor act. The main issue is the reaction from Coworker B. So answer B.\n"
