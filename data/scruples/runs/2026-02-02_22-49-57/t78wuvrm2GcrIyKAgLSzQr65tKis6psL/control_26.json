And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The friend clipped her nails at work, which Coworker B found disgusting and confrontational. The friend then clipped more nails after the initial one and responded with \"chill out\" when B complained.\n\nFirst, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? Well, it's a common activity people do at home, but in an office setting, it might be seen as unprofessional or disruptive. The fact that B heard it from 100 feet away suggests it was loud or frequent, which could be annoying to others. The friend's action of clipping more nails after B's complaint might come off as defiant or dismissive, which could escalate the situation.\n\nThen there's the response \"chill out.\" That's pretty casual and might not address B's concerns properly. It could be seen as rude or not taking B's feelings into account. However, B initially confronted the friend in person, which might have been over the top as well. B's reaction seems extreme, but the friend's response was also flippant.\n\nWorkplace norms vary, but generally, maintaining a respectful environment is key. If the friend's actions were causing discomfort or disruption, even if it's a minor thing like nail clipping, it's worth considering. However, Coworker B's approach\u2014confronting in person and then texting\u2014might be the real issue here. The friend might not be entirely at fault if the act itself isn't against company policy, but responding with \"chill out\" isn't helpful. Maybe the right approach is to find a solution, like doing it in a less audible area or during a break.\n\nIn conclusion, the friend might not be the asshole if the act itself isn't prohibited, but the response could have been better. However, since the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong, the answer hinges on workplace etiquette and how both parties handled it. The friend's actions were somewhat inconsiderate, but B's reaction was also extreme. However, since the friend continued after being asked and responded dismissively, maybe the friend is partially at fault. But considering standard norms, clipping nails isn't a major issue unless it's disruptive. The answer is B (No), because the friend isn't entirely wrong, but it's a grey area. However, I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The friend did clip nails after being told to stop, which could be seen as defiance. So maybe A (Yes). Hmm. The initial act isn't wrong, but continuing after being asked to stop is. So the friend's actions after the first complaint are where the issue is. So maybe A is correct. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend was doing something that's not prohibited, but B is being overly sensitive, then the author might not be wrong. It's tricky. I think the answer is B (No), because the act itself isn't inherently wrong, but the response could be better. However, the act of continuing after being asked might tip it towards A. But the initial problem is whether the act is wrong. Since work norms vary, and unless there's a policy against it, it's not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
