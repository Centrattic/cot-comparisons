And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a friend who initially mentions having a hanging nail and clips it. Then a coworker overhears and scolds her, leading the friend to clip more nails and get another complaint. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic of debate. Some people find it gross because of the sound or the mess, while others see it as a normal activity. The key points here are that the friend did it in her own cubicle, which might be considered a private space, but the noise carried to another person. \n\nCoworker B seems to be very vocal about it, calling it disgusting and even hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which could be seen as dismissive of the other person's feelings. \n\nWorkplace policies might matter here too. If there's a rule against eating or doing certain things at work, clipping nails might fall into a gray area. But without specific policies mentioned, it's hard to say.\n\nThe friend's actions: clipping one nail because it was hanging is understandable. Clipping two more to \"even things out\" might be seen as unnecessary, especially after being told not to. However, if the friend felt it was needed for her comfort, maybe that's her choice. The main issue is the reaction from coworker B and how the friend handled it.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? If the workplace has a policy against it, then yes. But without that, it's about mutual respect. The friend might not be wrong for doing something personal in her space, but the dismissive response could be problematic. Coworker B's reaction is also overzealous. \n\nOverall, the friend might not be the asshole, but maybe she could have handled it better by being more considerate of the noise. However, since she was in her own cubicle, it's a judgment call. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the action isn't inherently wrong, but the response could be unkind. But considering the context, the friend's actions were reasonable, and coworker B overreacted.\n"
