And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset about it, calling it disgusting, and the friend responding with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms in the workplace. Clipping nails might be seen as something people usually do at home, not in public or workspaces. But some people might do it if they're busy or need to fix something quickly. The key points here are the context and the reaction.\n\nThe friend clipped her nails in her own cubicle. That's her personal space, so maybe she thought it was okay. But Coworker B found it so offensive that she went over to demand she stop. The friend then continued, clipping more nails, which led to Coworker B hearing it from 100 feet away and being upset. The friend responded dismissively with \"chill out,\" which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nNow, the debate is about whether it's gross or not. Some people might think it's normal to fix a problem like a hanging nail, especially if it's causing discomfort. Others might find the sound of clippers and the act of doing it in the office unhygienic or distracting. The friend's action isn't illegal or against the law, but workplace etiquette can vary. If the workplace has a policy against certain activities, that could matter, but there's no mention of such a policy here.\n\nThe main issue is the perception and the reaction. The friend might not have considered how her actions affected others, especially since Coworker B is very vocal about it. The friend's response was dismissive, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the act itself isn't inherently wrong, the way it's handled\u2014ignoring a coworker's discomfort and continuing the action\u2014might make the friend the asshole.\n\nBut then again, Coworker B's initial demand might have been over the top. Maybe the friend was just trying to fix a minor issue quickly. However, the friend's decision to clip more nails after being asked to stop could be seen as escalating the situation. The response of \"chill out\" is also a bit rude, as it invalidates the coworker's feelings.\n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, if an action is causing a disturbance or discomfort to others, it's generally a good idea to be considerate. Since Coworker B was clearly upset, the friend might have been better off doing it elsewhere or at a different time. Alternatively, using a nail clipper in a private space but still in an open office might be unavoidable. But continuing after being asked to stop might be where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the friend's actions led to a disruption, and her response was dismissive. Even if the act itself isn't a big deal, the way she handled the situation might make her the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
