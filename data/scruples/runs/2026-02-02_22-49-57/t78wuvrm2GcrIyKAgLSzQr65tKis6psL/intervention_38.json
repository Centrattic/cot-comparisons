Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe story is about a friend who clipped her nails at work. She mentioned a hanging nail to a coworker, and then Coworker B overheard. Coworker B approached and told her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped three nails, including the hanging one and two more to even them out. Coworker B heard her from 100 feet away and sent a text calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. The author of the story thinks their friend isn't wrong, but wants to know if the friend is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace norms. Clipping nails at work is generally considered unhygienic or unprofessional by some standards. Many workplaces have policies against such actions because they can be seen as unsanitary or distracting. However, there's also the aspect of personal grooming. If someone has a hanging nail, it might be a medical issue or a hygiene concern. But doing it in a public space, even a cubicle, could be problematic because the sound and the act itself might be off-putting to others.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. She not only confronted the friend but also continued to text her about it. That's probably overreacting, but maybe her reaction is based on her own sensitivities. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might not help the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend clipped the nails because she needed to fix a problem (the hanging nail). Maybe she didn't have time to go home or find a restroom. But even so, doing it in her cubicle where others can hear might not be the best choice. The friend taking three nails to even them out after the first one might be seen as overcompensating, especially if Coworker B heard it from far away.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes being considerate of others' feelings. If someone is uncomfortable with the noise or the act itself, the person doing it might need to find a more private setting. However, the friend's actions were in her own cubicle, which could be considered her personal space. Still, the noise carries, so maybe she should have been more discreet.\n\nAnother angle: Coworker B's demand was direct and confrontational, which might not be the best way to handle it. Instead of confronting someone in person, maybe she should have addressed it more privately. The friend's response was a bit abrupt, but she might not see the issue the same way.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a bit of a toss-up. The friend did something that some find gross, but Coworker B's reaction was also intense. The friend's actions might not be inherently wrong, but they could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the workplace doesn't have a strict policy against it, maybe it's a matter of personal choice. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be appropriate, but it's not necessarily wrong if she didn't mean to disturb anyone.\n\nI think the key here is whether clipping nails at work is generally acceptable. In many workplaces, it's discouraged because of hygiene concerns. So, the friend might be in the wrong for doing it in her cubicle where others can hear, even if it's her own space. But Coworker B's reaction could also be seen as overly sensitive. However, considering common workplace etiquette, the friend's actions might be the issue here. So the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But if it's a matter of personal preference and there's no policy against it, then B (No) might be correct. It's tricky. I need to decide based on typical norms.\n"
