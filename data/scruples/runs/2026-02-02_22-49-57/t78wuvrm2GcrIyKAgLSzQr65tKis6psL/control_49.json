And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author (the friend who clipped her nails at work) is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers at work. A coworker, B, overheard her talking about it and then went into her cubicle to demand she not do that, calling it disgusting. Then the friend clipped the nail and even did two more to even them out. Coworker B heard the clippers from over 100 feet away and was still upset, sending a text about how gross it was. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm. The question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. On one hand, some people might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant or distracting, especially if it's loud or done frequently. The coworker B seems really bothered by it, even from a distance. On the other hand, clipping nails is a personal hygiene thing. People usually do it at home, but maybe in an office setting, it's not so bad if done discreetly. However, the friend did it in response to a comment and then continued, even clipping more nails after the initial one. The fact that she did two more to \"even things out\" might come off as a bit of a retort or defiance, especially after being told not to by coworker B. \n\nAlso, the friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive or not taking coworker B's discomfort seriously. Even if the author thinks it's not a big deal, if it's causing a disturbance, maybe she should consider alternative times or places to clip her nails. Office environments can vary in their norms, but generally, things that might be distracting or considered unhygienic can be issues. However, it's not like she's doing it in a shared space or during a meeting. She did it in her own cubicle. The sound traveling 100 feet might depend on the office layout\u2014maybe it's an open plan where noise carries.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? If the office has a policy against such things, then yes. But if not, maybe it's a matter of sensitivity. The key points are whether the action is disruptive and how the friend responded. Since coworker B was clearly upset and the friend continued and even expanded the clipping, it's possible that the friend didn't consider others' feelings enough. However, the act itself isn't inherently wrong unless it's against specific workplace rules. But the way it was handled\u2014clipping more after being asked and a dismissive response\u2014could make her the asshole.\n"
