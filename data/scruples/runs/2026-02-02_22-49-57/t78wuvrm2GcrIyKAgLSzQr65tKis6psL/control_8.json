And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is the asshole. The user wants a yes or no answer.\n\nSo first, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Another coworker overheard her commenting on it, then Coworker B confronts her, saying it's disgusting. The friend clips her nails in her cubicle, then does two more to even them out. Coworker B texts her that she can hear it from far away and finds it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out\".\n\nNow, considering office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common debate. Some people find it gross because of the sound, the mess, or the fact that it's not typically done in public spaces. Others argue that if someone needs to do it quickly and it's not disruptive, it's okay. The key factors here are whether the friend was being considerate of others.\n\nThe friend did it in her cubicle, which is probably private. But Coworker B could hear from 100 feet away. That might indicate the sound was loud or she was being sensitive to it. The friend clipped more nails than necessary after the first one, which could be seen as unnecessary. Also, responding with \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, especially if Coworker B was genuinely uncomfortable.\n\nBut the friend had a legitimate reason (hanging nail) and used her own clippers. If she did it quickly in her cubicle without making a mess, maybe it's not her fault. However, the act of doing more than necessary after being told to stop might escalate the issue. The friend's response to the coworker was probably not the best way to handle the situation, showing a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, is she the asshole? It's a bit subjective. Some might say Coworker B is overreacting, but the friend's actions did cause discomfort. The friend could have avoided it by doing it outside work hours. But since she was already at work and needed to do it, maybe she wasn't entirely wrong. However, the fact that she continued clipping more nails after the initial correction and then dismissed the coworker's feelings might tip the scale. So, maybe the author is in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit conflicted. The key points are the unnecessary clipping and the dismissive response.\n"
