And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work is considered inconsiderate or gross. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers, then did a couple more to even them out. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and sent a text saying it's disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Generally, clipping nails in public areas might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. However, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she thought it was okay. The key points are location and noise. Even if in a cubicle, the sound might carry, especially if the building is quiet. Coworker B was over 100 feet away but still heard it, which could indicate the sound is disruptive. \n\nThen, the friend clipped three nails after having one hanging. Maybe she felt embarrassed or wanted to fix all, but doing them all at once might have been overkill. The response \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive, not taking Coworker B's feelings into account.\n\nIs the friend in the wrong? It's a judgment call. Some might say it's reasonable to clip nails in a private cubicle, but others might find the noise and timing inconsiderate. The fact that the coworker was upset and the friend didn't acknowledge their discomfort could tip the scales. The friend's actions were inconsiderate, but maybe not entirely wrong. However, the response to Coworker B was dismissive, which could indicate a lack of empathy. So maybe the friend is partly at fault. But the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on office norms. If the workplace allows such things, maybe not. But if the coworker's reaction is valid, then the friend should have been more considerate. Since the friend didn't apologize or adjust, perhaps she's the asshole. Hmm. But the initial action was to fix a problem (hanging nail), which is understandable. The follow-up of clipping more might be overdoing it. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider others' feelings and continued after being told. Her response \"chill out\" was dismissive. So the answer would be A.\n"
