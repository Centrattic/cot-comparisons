And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The friend mentions a hanging nail to a coworker, then Coworker B overhears. Coworker B confronts her, saying it's disgusting. The friend then clips her nails, and even trims two more to even them out. After that, Coworker B texts her again, upset that the sound was heard from far away and calls it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? It depends on company policies and workplace norms. Some places might have rules against it due to hygiene or noise concerns. But if there's no policy, it's more about social etiquette.\n\nCoworker B seems very sensitive about the sound and finds it disgusting. The friend, however, felt it was necessary and tried to handle it in her cubicle. The act of clipping one nail to fix a problem is understandable, but clipping two more might be seen as unnecessary. The \"chill out\" response could come off as dismissive, which might escalate the tension.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction is strong, maybe even over the top. Not everyone finds nail clipping gross, so it's subjective. The friend was trying to address a minor issue in a private space (her cubicle). The sound traveling might be an issue in a quiet office environment, but again, it's situational.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others' sensitivities. If the friend was aware that Coworker B was bothered, maybe she should have found another time or place. However, the friend might not have realized the extent of the disturbance. The fact that Coworker B directly confronted her and then later texted suggests that the friend's actions were intrusive.\n\nClipping two more nails after the initial one could be seen as exacerbating the problem, especially if the first clip was just to fix a problem. The \"chill out\" response might be perceived as not taking the coworker's feelings seriously.\n\nIn summary, while there's no clear policy violation, the friend's actions did cause discomfort. The key factors are the workplace environment, social norms, and the response to Coworker B's concerns. The friend might not be in the wrong if there's no rule against it, but she could have been more considerate. However, since the coworker was directly affected and the friend added more clipped nails, it's possible the friend overstepped. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is A or B. Let me think again. Since there's no policy mentioned, the friend isn't necessarily wrong, but the actions did bother someone. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal hygiene issue, but some might say A. Hmm. I think it's B, but maybe A. Need to decide based on typical etiquette. Usually, people clip nails in private, but in an office, if it's a shared space, maybe it's inconsiderate. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private. The main issue is the sound traveling. Since Coworker B was very sensitive, the friend could have done it in a break room or outside. So maybe A. But some say B. I'm torn. Let me check similar situations. In many workplaces, clipping nails isn't prohibited, but if it's disturbing others, then it's a problem. The friend's response was dismissive, which is unhelpful. So maybe A. But the initial act isn't inherently wrong. The final answer is A or B. I think the answer is A because the actions were inconsiderate and caused issues, so the friend is the asshole. Wait, but the user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong. So if the friend's actions were inconsiderate, then A. But maybe B because there's no rule against it. I need to decide based on the context. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is her space, but the sound affected others. So maybe A. Answer A.\n"
