And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The scenario is that a friend of the author was told by a coworker not to clip nails at work because it's gross. The friend then clipped a few more nails and got another complaint. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to determine if clipping nails at work is considered inappropriate in most workplaces. Generally, nail clipping can be seen as a personal hygiene activity, but it might depend on the work environment. If it's a medical or food-related job, maybe it's not allowed. But the story doesn't specify that. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which might be considered a semi-private space.\n\nCoworker B overheard the conversation and then confronted her. The friend clipped the nails after the confrontation. The coworker then texts to complain about hearing the clipping from far away. The friend's response was dismissive.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the friend's action was inconsiderate. Clipping nails can be noisy and might disturb others, even if done in a cubicle. It's possible that in an office setting, where people are around, doing something that's not typically done at work (like clipping nails) could be seen as unprofessional or inconsiderate. However, if there's no specific workplace policy against it, maybe it's a matter of personal choice.\n\nThe coworker's reaction seems over the top, but the friend's response to just \"chill out\" might not be the best approach. Maybe the friend should have taken the complaint seriously and avoided doing it in the workplace. Alternatively, if there's no rule against it, the coworker is being overly sensitive.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might find nail clipping gross because of the sound or the mess, but others don't. The friend might not be at fault if there's no policy against it, but if it's causing disturbance, then it could be considered unprofessional. The key here is whether the action is against company policy. Since the story doesn't mention any policy, it's hard to say. But generally, if an action is disturbing coworkers without a valid reason, it's better to avoid it. So maybe the friend was inconsiderate, but not necessarily the \"asshole.\" The coworker is also being overly critical.\n\nHmm, the answer might depend on cultural norms and workplace context. But based on the information given, both sides have points. The friend might not be entirely wrong if there's no rule against it, but the response to the complaint could have been better. However, the main issue is whether the act itself is wrong. If it's a private cubicle and not a public area, maybe it's acceptable. But if the noise is bothering others, then maybe it's not. The friend's action led to complaints, so perhaps she's at fault for not considering others' feelings, even if there's no explicit rule. So maybe answer A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, answer B if it's just a matter of differing opinions. Need to weigh the arguments.\n"
