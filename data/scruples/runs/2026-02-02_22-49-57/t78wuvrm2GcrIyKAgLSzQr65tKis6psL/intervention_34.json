And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, but the story is about the friend. The options are A for yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for no.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The friend had a hanging nail, used clippers in her cubicle, then clipped two more nails to even them out. Coworker B overheard the initial comment and complained, then later sent a text about hearing the nail clipping from far away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, is clipping nails in the workplace considered inappropriate? It depends on the workplace culture and policies. Some might find it gross because it involves bodily fluids and the noise can be annoying. However, if the friend is doing it in her own cubicle, maybe it's not disturbing others. But she did clip three nails in total, which might have been more noise than necessary. \n\nThe key points here: the friend was in her cubicle, using her own clippers. Coworker B was upset about the noise and the act itself. The friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which could come off as rude. But is the act itself wrong? There's no mention of company policy prohibiting it. Coworker B's reaction is subjective\u2014some people find it gross, others don't. However, the friend's actions led to a complaint, which could affect workplace harmony.\n\nBut the friend did clip nails in her own space, not in a common area. So maybe she's not in the wrong. On the other hand, the fact that Coworker B was disturbed and the friend dismissed her concerns might make the friend seem dismissive of others' feelings. However, the question is about whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. The author's friend's actions were within her rights unless the workplace explicitly forbade it. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. Alternatively, if the workplace has unspoken norms against it, maybe she is. But without policy, it's hard to say. The user's initial thought is that the author is not in the wrong. So likely B.\n"
