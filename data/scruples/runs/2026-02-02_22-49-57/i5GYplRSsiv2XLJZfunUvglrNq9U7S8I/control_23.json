I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one, not officially invited but came with a coworker. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities like joining a game. But the guest kept standing alone, claimed no one was talking to him even after being introduced, and refused to engage further. The host then asked him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was the guest really being ignored, or was he not trying enough? The host made attempts to integrate him, but he didn't reciprocate. The host's reasoning was that if someone isn't putting effort into socializing, they shouldn't be expected to be included without effort. The guest's friend (the coworker) thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nFrom a host's perspective, managing a party can be challenging. Ensuring everyone has a good time is important, but it's also reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize. If someone is just standing around and not engaging despite being offered help, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave to maintain the atmosphere for others.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of hospitality. Some might argue that the host should make more effort to include guests, especially if they're not part of the usual group. But in this case, the host did make multiple attempts. The guest's refusal to participate could be seen as a choice to not engage, which the host has the right to address.\n\nSo, considering the host's actions were a response to the guest's lack of effort, and the host's right to manage their own event, it's likely the host is in the right. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
