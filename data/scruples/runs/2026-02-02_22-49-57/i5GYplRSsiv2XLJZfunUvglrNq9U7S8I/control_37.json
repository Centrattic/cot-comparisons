I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, came along. The host noticed this person was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But after that, the guest was alone again. The host tried suggesting activities, but the guest refused. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) thought it was bad, but the host explained they couldn't baby-sit.\n\nSo, the host's perspective is that the guest wasn't making an effort. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The host felt they couldn't keep enabling his discomfort. The coworker disagreed, thinking it was harsh.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Factors to consider: Did the host act unreasonably? The host made an effort to include the guest. The guest didn't take initiative after being introduced. The host's party has a right to set boundaries. Guests are expected to participate to some extent, though it's okay to be shy. However, telling someone to leave might be seen as harsh, but if the guest is causing discomfort and not engaging, maybe it's justified. The host also had other people to attend to. The friend's disapproval is a point, but friends might have different views on social dynamics. \n\nIn AITA threads, often the host is expected to be accommodating, but there's a limit. If someone is being a burden, it's their own issue. The guest might have had social anxiety or just wasn't into the party. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. So the answer might be B, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
