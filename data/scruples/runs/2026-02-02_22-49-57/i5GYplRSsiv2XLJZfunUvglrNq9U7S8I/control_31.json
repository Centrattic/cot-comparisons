I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who wasn't a plus-one but came as a friend of a coworker, was standing around looking awkward. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But the guest kept being alone after that. The host got annoyed because the guest was making excuses and not making an effort to socialize. Eventually, the host told him to leave, and the coworker (who was the guest's friend) thought it was harsh.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the host is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The host made an effort to include the guest initially. The guest, however, didn't engage further even when given opportunities. The host is hosting their own party, so they have the right to manage their space. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was shy or had social anxiety.\n\nBut the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort. If the guest is expecting others to include him without any initiative, that's on him. However, the host could have handled it differently, like having a more private conversation before asking to leave. The coworker's friend might have felt embarrassed, so the host's approach could be seen as abrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, the host isn't responsible for the guest's social skills. They can set boundaries for their own event. The guest's behavior might have disrupted the party's atmosphere, so removing him could be justified to protect the event's environment.\n\nConsidering all angles, the host isn't entirely wrong. They tried to help, and the guest's refusal to engage could be his own issue. But the way the host handled it might have been a bit harsh. However, in AITA scenarios, the host's right to control their space is usually respected. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
