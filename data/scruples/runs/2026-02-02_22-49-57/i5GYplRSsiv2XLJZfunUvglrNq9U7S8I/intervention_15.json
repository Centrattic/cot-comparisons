I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The situation involves a party where the guest was a plus one but not really. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up alone again. The host got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. Let me break it down. The host made efforts to include the guest, like talking to him and introducing him. The guest, however, didn't take initiative to mingle or join activities even when suggested. The host's frustration is understandable because they were trying to manage the party and ensure everyone had fun. But is it fair to kick someone out for not being social? \n\nOn one hand, the host is responsible for the environment and can set boundaries. If someone is not making an effort to participate, it might be reasonable to ask them to leave if they're disruptive. On the other hand, maybe the guest was just introverted or nervous. The host could have given more time or tried another approach. However, in this case, the guest repeatedly said no one was talking to him despite the host's attempts. The host might feel they can't manage every guest's social needs.\n\nI think the key points are the host's attempts to help and the guest's lack of effort. The host didn't act out of malice but out of necessity to manage the party. So the answer would lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
