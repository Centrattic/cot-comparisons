I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe writer had a party and noticed a guest (a plus one of a coworker) was being awkward. They approached the guest twice, tried to help by introducing them to someone with similar interests and suggesting activities like a game. The guest kept saying people weren't talking to him but didn't take initiative to mingle. The writer then told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset. The writer is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break down the key points. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The writer tried to help by talking to him, introducing him, and suggesting activities. The guest refused to engage and kept saying no one was talking to him. The writer got frustrated and told him to leave. The coworker thought it was shitty, but the writer explained their reasoning.\n\nIs the writer responsible for making sure the guest socializes? Well, the guest was a plus one, maybe not expected to be overly social. But the writer tried to facilitate. However, the guest didn't make an effort. The writer's action was to tell him to leave because he wasn't participating and was possibly seeking attention. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the writer was in the wrong. On one hand, the guest was there, and the writer tried to help. On the other, kicking someone out might be harsh. But the writer's party, so they have the right to manage their event. The guest wasn't making efforts and was possibly being difficult. The writer might not be in the wrong because they tried to help but also had the right to set boundaries. The coworker friend's reaction might be a point, but the writer's actions were in response to the guest's inaction. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made efforts to integrate the guest, but when that failed, they had the right to ask someone to leave if they were not contributing to the social environment. The guest's behavior was passive and perhaps expecting others to fix the situation, which isn't fair. So the author isn't at fault here.\n"
