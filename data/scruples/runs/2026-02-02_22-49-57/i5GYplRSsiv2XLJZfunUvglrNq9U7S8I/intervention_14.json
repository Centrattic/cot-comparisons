I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are:\n\n1. The guest was a plus one but not officially invited. He came with a coworker's friend, but they arrived separately.\n2. The author noticed the guest was standing alone and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. They even suggested activities like a game of Uno, but he refused.\n3. The guest kept complaining about not being spoken to, even though he was talked to earlier. The author got annoyed and told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The guest left, and the author informed the coworker.\n4. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was \"shitty\" to kick him out, but the author defended their reasoning.\n\nNow, considering social norms and host responsibilities. As a host, it's reasonable to ensure the party is enjoyable for everyone. However, the line between being a responsible host and being overly controlling can be thin. The author made an effort to integrate the guest, but when the guest resisted all attempts and just wanted others to make the effort, the author decided to remove him. \n\nThe guest's actions could be seen as passive, not making an effort to engage. The author had the right to enforce some level of social interaction to maintain the party's atmosphere. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might be seen as harsh if the guest was genuinely trying but struggling. But in this case, the guest refused the suggestions and didn't make any effort to mingle, which could justify the host's decision.\n\nAlso, the guest was a plus one not officially invited. The host might feel less obligated to accommodate him. The author's actions were direct but justified given the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment. The coworker's friend's reaction is subjective, but the author's reasoning is valid. So, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
