I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party, and a guest (friend of a coworker) came along. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but he ended up alone again. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort and told him to leave. The coworker thought it was shitty, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The host tried to assist the guest by talking to him and introducing him. The guest, however, didn't engage further and refused suggestions to join activities. The host felt that the guest wasn't making an effort, so they asked him to leave. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect a guest to make some effort to socialize? Yes, especially when they've been introduced. However, the host's approach of telling him to leave might be seen as harsh. But the host also tried to help multiple times. The guest might have been shy or anxious, so maybe the host should have been more patient. On the other hand, the host has the right to manage their party and set boundaries.\n\nThe coworker's reaction suggests that some people might think the host was too harsh, but the host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort. The answer hinges on whether the host overstepped or if they had the right to ask someone to leave if they weren't contributing to the social aspect.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider both the host's responsibility and the guest's actions. If the guest was a plus one and wasn't making an effort, maybe the host is justified. But if the guest was just awkward, the host might be in the wrong. The key points are the host's attempts to help and the guest's lack of effort. The host might not be in the wrong here because they tried to assist and the guest didn't engage.\n"
