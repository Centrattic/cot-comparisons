I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. So I need to analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest was a plus one but not officially. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept being alone again and refused to join in. The host got annoyed, thinking the guest was just seeking attention or wanted others to make an effort. The host then told him to leave, and the guest left. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the host act appropriately given the circumstances? Did the guest have a right to be there? The guest was a plus one, which might not be an official invitation, but maybe the host still allowed him to come. The host made efforts to help the guest socialize, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's main role is to host the party, and if a guest isn't contributing or engaging, it's reasonable to ask them if they want to stay. However, the host might have overstepped by directly telling the guest to leave, especially if the guest wasn't causing any disturbance. The host's frustration is understandable, but maybe there's a more diplomatic way. However, the guest was making the host and others uncomfortable by not trying to socialize. The coworker's reaction is mixed, but the host is within their rights to manage their own party. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a cultural norm or expectation I'm missing. In many cases, hosts can ask guests to leave if they're disruptive or not following the social norms of the event. Since the guest was standoffish and uncooperative despite efforts, the host's action might be justified.\n"
