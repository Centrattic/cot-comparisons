I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The story is that the guest was a plus one, came separately, and kept standing around saying no one was talking to him. The author tried to help by introducing him to a friend, but after he was left alone again, the author told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations at a party. Typically, guests are expected to socialize to some degree, but it's not unreasonable for someone to feel awkward, especially if they're a plus one. The author took the initiative to introduce him once. The guest might have valid social anxiety or shyness. However, the author might feel that if someone isn't making an effort, they're not contributing to the positive atmosphere.\n\nThe key points here are: the guest was told to leave after multiple attempts to help. The author's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. The coworker (the guest's plus one) thought it was shitty, but the author explained their reasoning. \n\nI need to balance between the guest's right to attend and the host's responsibility to manage the party. The host might have a right to ask someone to leave if they're disruptive, but standing around alone isn't necessarily disruptive. However, if the guest is making others uncomfortable or not respecting the event's purpose, that's different. Here, the guest was just unengaged. \n\nPossible angles: Was the author overly harsh? Did they give enough opportunities for the guest to engage? The author tried once, then the guest was alone again. The author might have been frustrated because the guest wasn't taking initiative. However, sometimes people just don't connect with others, and it's not their fault. The author could have handled it more gracefully, like offering to help again or giving more time. \n\nBut the author is the host, so they also have the right to set boundaries. If the guest was disruptive or causing issues, removing them is justified. In this case, the guest was just not socializing. Maybe the author didn't do anything wrong, but maybe they could have been more patient. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether not socializing is a valid reason to remove someone. If the party's purpose is social interaction, then maybe the host has a right to expect guests to participate. However, not everyone is comfortable in social settings, and expecting someone to \"mingle\" might be unfair. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they were the host and had to manage the event. However, the guest might have felt excluded, and the host could have handled it more diplomatically. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the guest wasn't disruptive but just unengaged, maybe the author is in the wrong for being too harsh. Alternatively, maybe not, because the host has the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the party.\n"
