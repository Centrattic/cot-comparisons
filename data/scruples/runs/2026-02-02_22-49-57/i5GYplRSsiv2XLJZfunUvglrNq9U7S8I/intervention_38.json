I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. I need to figure out whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosted a party with friends and coworkers. A guest was a plus-one but came separately. The guest seemed awkward and said no one was talking to him. The author tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but after the guest didn't engage, the author told him to leave. The coworker (the one who invited him) thought it was harsh, but the author defended their decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are the guest's behavior and the author's response. The guest claims he was being ignored, but the author noticed he didn't make an effort to socialize. The author tried twice to help him connect, but the guest didn't follow through. Then the author told him to leave, which the coworker found mean.\n\nI need to consider if the author was in the wrong. The guest's own friend (the coworker) didn't accompany him, so maybe the guest was expecting the host to take full responsibility for his social interactions. The author did make an initial effort by talking to him and introducing him. But after that, the guest went back to being isolated and refused further suggestions. The author's home is a private space, and they have the right to manage their environment. If the guest was being uncooperative and not making an effort, the author might feel justified in asking him to leave, especially if they were trying to maintain a lively atmosphere.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have been more patient or that it's unfair to blame the guest for not socializing. But the author also mentions that the guest wanted others to make the effort, which isn't always the case. In social situations, it's mutual; guests can initiate conversations too. The author's response was firm but perhaps reasonable given the guest's lack of engagement. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's reaction might indicate that the author's response was abrupt. But the author had their limits and didn't want to spend time dragging the guest around. It's a balance between hospitality and personal boundaries. Since the guest didn't put in any effort beyond being passive, the author's decision to ask him to leave isn't necessarily the wrong. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
