I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post, right?\n\nSo the author hosted a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. The guest stood around awkwardly, was approached by the host to check on them, introduced to someone with similar interests, but then kept being alone again. The host tried suggesting activities, but the guest refused. Eventually, the host asked them to leave, and the coworker was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the host's actions were justified. The host tried to help by talking to the guest, introducing them, and suggesting activities. The guest didn't take initiative to engage. Hosts have the right to manage their event and ensure it's enjoyable for everyone. If someone is not making an effort, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the host's experience or others.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of social responsibility. Should the host be expected to keep intervening until the guest socializes? The guest might have felt anxious or uncomfortable, and maybe the host could have given more time. However, the host did make attempts. Also, the coworker's friend isn't the host's responsibility beyond initial help. The host isn't obligated to force social interactions.\n\nThe key here is whether the host went too far. The guest might have felt embarrassed, but the host's party is their space. If someone is unwilling to participate and remains a disruption, the host can enforce boundaries. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The host tried to assist but also set a boundary when the guest wasn't making an effort.\n"
