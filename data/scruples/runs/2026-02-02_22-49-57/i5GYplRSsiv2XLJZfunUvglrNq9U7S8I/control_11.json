I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked someone out of their party is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guest was a plus one but not officially invited, came separately, and kept standing around alone. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but when he refused to engage further, the host told him to leave. The coworker later criticized the host.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They organized the party, invited friends and coworkers, and provided food and games. It's reasonable for them to expect guests to participate or at least make an effort. The guest in question didn't engage despite being offered help. The host took steps to include him, like introducing him to someone with similar interests and suggesting games. When he refused and continued to isolate, the host lost patience.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been shy or uncomfortable. It's possible he felt awkward in a new social setting. However, the host's responsibility isn't to force someone to socialize. The guest had the choice to make an effort. The host's actions were a response to the guest's lack of initiative after multiple attempts to include him.\n\nThe key points are whether the host overstepped by asking him to leave. Since the host made efforts to help and the guest didn't reciprocate, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The host has the right to manage their party and ask someone to leave if they're disruptive or not engaging. The coworker's disapproval might not be valid because it's the host's house and their rules.\n\nSo, the host isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
