I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation starts with a guest who was a plus one but not officially invited. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. But the guest kept standing alone, refused to join activities, and then the host told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They hosted the party, made an effort to include the guest, but when the guest didn't engage, the host felt it was necessary to ask them to leave. The host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort, so it's not the host's responsibility to keep dragging them into social interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or uncomfortable, which isn't uncommon. The host's coworker, who was the guest's friend, might have felt the host was too harsh. But the host also has the right to manage their own party. If someone is not contributing to the social environment and is a burden, maybe the host is justified in removing them, especially if they've already tried to help.\n\nBut then, was the host too quick to judge? The guest might have had valid reasons for not socializing\u2014maybe they were shy, had social anxiety, or just didn't feel like it that night. The host might have overstepped by not giving the guest more time or understanding that socializing isn't always easy. However, the host did make an effort to include the guest twice. If the guest still didn't engage, maybe it's reasonable to set a boundary.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the host give the guest enough support? The answer is yes\u2014they tried talking, introducing them, suggesting activities. The guest refused. Then, the host's decision to ask them to leave could be seen as a reasonable choice to prevent the guest from being a disruption. But some might argue that it's impolite to ask someone to leave, regardless of the reason. However, the host is the one hosting, so they do have some authority over the environment.\n\nIn terms of whether the host is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But considering the host tried to help and the guest wasn't cooperating, the host's actions might be justified. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
