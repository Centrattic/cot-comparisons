I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party, and a guest (a friend of a coworker) came. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, even suggested games. But the guest kept refusing to engage. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nI need to determine if the host was wrong. Let's think about the host's actions. They made an effort to include the guest, offered multiple opportunities to socialize. The guest, on the other hand, didn't take the initiative to interact beyond the initial help. The host might have felt that their efforts were being ignored and that the guest was being passive. However, kicking someone out might come off as harsh, even if justified.\n\nBut on the other hand, the host is responsible for their party and can set boundaries. If a guest is not contributing to the social environment and is being a burden, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. The guest might have social anxiety or other issues, but that doesn't mean the host is responsible to fix that. The host's response was firm but after several attempts to help. The coworker's reaction might be about sensitivity, but the host's right to manage their own event is important.\n\nSo, considering all that, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to assist, gave chances, and when the guest didn't respond, they had the right to ask them to leave. The answer would be B, No.\n"
