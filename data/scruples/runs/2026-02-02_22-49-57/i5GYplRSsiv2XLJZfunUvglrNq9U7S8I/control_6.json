I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed him being awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. However, the guest kept being alone, refused to join activities, and when asked, said no one was talking to him. The host got annoyed and told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker later called it \"shitty,\" but the host defended their action by saying the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. On one hand, the host tried to help the guest by introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest, however, didn't make an effort to interact beyond the initial help. The host's party is their own space; they might have a right to set boundaries. But on the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely shy or had social anxiety, and the host's response was harsh. \n\nBut the guest kept complaining about not being talked to even after being introduced. The host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere. However, the host isn't obligated to force social interactions. The guest's refusal to engage despite being given opportunities might justify the host's decision. The key point is whether the host acted unreasonably. Since the guest didn't make an effort, the host's action could be seen as within their rights. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
