I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosted a party, invited friends and coworkers, and a guest came with a coworker. The guest was left alone twice, despite the author's attempts to help. The guest claimed no one was talking to him, but when asked again, he shrugged and refused to join activities. The author then told him to leave, and some backlash from the coworker followed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was justified in asking the guest to leave. Let's consider social norms and host responsibilities. A host typically ensures guests are comfortable, but they also have the right to set boundaries. If a guest is uncooperative and refuses to engage, the host might feel it's necessary to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the event's atmosphere.\n\nThe guest's behavior here seems passive-aggressive. He was given chances to socialize but didn't take initiative. The author tried to help twice. The guest's refusal to participate in suggested activities (like UNO) might indicate they weren't interested in the party, making the host's decision to ask them to leave reasonable.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that the host should be more accommodating. But the key point is that the guest didn't make any effort themselves. The author provided opportunities, and the guest didn't take them. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. Also, the author communicated the issue to the coworker, which shows transparency.\n\nIn similar situations, hosts have the right to manage their event as they see fit. If someone is a disruption or not respecting the social environment, asking them to leave isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
