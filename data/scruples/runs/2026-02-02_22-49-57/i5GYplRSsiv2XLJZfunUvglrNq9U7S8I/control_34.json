I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who wasn't a direct invitee but came with a coworker, was standing around alone. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, and suggesting activities like a game. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo the question is, was the host wrong? Let's consider the host's perspective. They tried to help the guest fit in, offered introductions and activities, but the guest didn't make an effort. The host felt the guest was being passive and not trying to engage. The host's responsibility is to manage the party, and if a guest is being a burden, maybe it's okay to ask them to leave if they're not contributing to the social environment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host should be more accommodating, especially since the guest was invited by a friend. But the host also has the right to set boundaries. The guest might have been socially awkward, but the host tried multiple times to help. If the guest still refuses to engage, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave to not disrupt the party.\n\nAlso, the coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. The host isn't obligated to keep someone who isn't making an effort to participate. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
