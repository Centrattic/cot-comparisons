I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: a party was thrown, and a guest who wasn't a direct invitee came along with a coworker. The guest was standing around alone, claimed no one was talking to him, even after being introduced to someone and then ignored again. The host tried to help by suggesting activities and introductions, but the guest refused. The host then asked him to leave, leading to the coworker (his friend) being upset.\n\nThe host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making efforts to socialize. The guest's issue seems to be that he felt ignored, but the host tried to assist. Now, is the host in the wrong?\n\nFrom a social perspective, when hosting a party, the host has the right to manage the environment. If a guest is not engaging and is being a burden, removing them isn't unreasonable. However, the host did make efforts to integrate the guest first, which is important. The guest's behavior might have been passive-aggressive or expecting others to accommodate him without effort. The host's response was firm but after attempts to help.\n\nThe coworker (his friend) thought it was \"shitty,\" but the host explained the reasoning. The host isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries. The key points: the guest didn't make effort, host tried to help, then asked to leave. The host isn't in the wrong here. So answer B.\n"
