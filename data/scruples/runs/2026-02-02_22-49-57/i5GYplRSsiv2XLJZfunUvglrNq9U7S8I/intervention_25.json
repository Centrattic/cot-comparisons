I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. \n\nFirst, the context: The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, came along. The guest was awkward and approached the host twice about not being socialized with. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests and suggesting activities like Uno, but the guest refused both times. Eventually, the host told the guest to leave if he wasn't going to socialize.\n\nThe host argues that the guest wasn't making an effort, just wanted others to make an effort for him, and that the host had their own event to manage. The coworker (his friend) thought the host was being \"shitty,\" but the host explained the situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the host act unfairly? Was the guest given enough opportunity to engage? Did the host give appropriate feedback or warnings before asking him to leave? \n\nThe host did approach the guest twice, tried to help him integrate, and after the guest refused both times, decided he couldn't be there. The host's party is their space, and they have the right to set boundaries. If the guest was disruptive or uncooperative despite efforts to include him, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong for removing someone who's not engaging and might be affecting the event's atmosphere. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host could have been more patient or found another solution. But given that the guest was standoffish and refused help, the host's decision seems reasonable. The coworker's reaction might reflect a different perspective, but the host isn't obligated to accommodate someone who isn't trying to participate. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
