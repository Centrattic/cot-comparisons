I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a party and a guest was being awkward. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. Then when the guest was alone again, the author got annoyed and told him to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The author tried twice to help him socialize\u2014first by talking to him and introducing him, then suggesting a game. The guest refused both times and kept standing alone. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author had the right to ask someone to leave. If the guest was not causing any disruption, just being awkward, maybe the author overstepped. But on the other hand, if the guest was making the author uncomfortable and not making an effort, maybe it's reasonable. \n\nAlso, the coworker (the guest's friend) was present. Did the author approach the coworker first before kicking out the guest? The author did let the coworker know after the fact. But maybe they should have discussed it with the coworker first instead of immediately asking the guest to leave. \n\nAnother angle: is it the host's responsibility to ensure all guests are included? Or is it on the guests to make their own social connections? The author might feel they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions, especially when the guest isn't making an effort. \n\nBut then again, sometimes people are shy or awkward, and as a host, maybe you should be more accommodating. However, in this case, the guest was given opportunities and refused. So maybe the author had a right to ask him to leave because he wasn't participating and was creating extra work for the host. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that they didn't have time to drag him around. Hosting a party can be stressful, and not everyone can be the social butterfly. But the line is thin. If the guest was harmless and just awkward, kicking them out might be harsh. But if they were disruptive, maybe not. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the author had the right to set boundaries for their own party. The coworker's friend might have been a guest who wasn't respectful of the host's time and efforts. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
