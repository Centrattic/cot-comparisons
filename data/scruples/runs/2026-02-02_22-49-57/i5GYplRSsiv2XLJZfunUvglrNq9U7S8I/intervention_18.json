I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" situation did the right thing by kicking a guest out for not socializing. So, first, I need to recap the situation to understand the context.\n\nThe host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host noticed this person was standing alone and tried to help by introducing them to someone and suggesting activities like a game. The guest responded that no one was talking to them, even after being introduced. When given options to join others, they refused. The host then told them to leave because they weren't making an effort to socialize. The coworker friend of the guest was upset, but the host felt it was justified.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and social expectations. The host made an effort to include the guest, but the guest didn't reciprocate. Social events often require guests to engage, not just rely on the host. However, forcing someone to socialize isn't fair either. \n\nBut the host provided opportunities, and when the guest didn't take them, the host decided to end the situation. The host's reasoning was that they couldn't spend all their time dragging the guest around. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nIn social settings, there's a balance between being a good host and respecting personal boundaries. If the guest was genuinely uncomfortable, maybe the host could have offered more help. However, the guest's refusal to engage in any suggested activities might have justified the host's decision. \n\nAnother angle is the guest's responsibility. They attended a social event and should be prepared to interact. If they found it too challenging, maybe they shouldn't have come. The host isn't obligated to ensure every guest is constantly engaged. \n\nSo, considering that the host tried multiple times to help the guest integrate and the guest didn't make an effort, the host's action might be justified. The guest's behavior could be seen as expecting the host to solve their social anxiety, which isn't the host's responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B, the host is not in the wrong.\n"
