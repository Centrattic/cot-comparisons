I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. One guest was a friend of a coworker, not a formal plus one. The guest was standing around alone a couple of times. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and even suggested joining a game. But the guest refused. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker (the friend's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, the key points here. The host tried to help the guest socialize. The guest, on the other hand, wasn't taking the initiative. The host felt it was a problem when the guest kept saying no one was talking to him despite the host's efforts. The host decided to ask him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. \n\nI need to consider if the host overstepped. Was it reasonable to ask someone to leave for not socializing? Well, the host is responsible for the party's atmosphere and their own comfort. If someone is making the host uncomfortable or not respecting the social norms, maybe they have the right to ask them to leave. But then again, forcing someone to socialize can be seen as rude, especially if the guest is there with the host's permission (as a plus one, even informally).\n\nHowever, the guest in question didn't make an effort. He was given multiple chances by the host to engage, but he refused. The host was trying to maintain a positive environment for other guests. So, maybe the host isn't wrong for doing what they did. The guest may have been socially awkward or unwilling, but the host isn't obligated to force interactions beyond a reasonable effort.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host could have been more patient or offered the guest a way to just enjoy the party without being pushed to socialize. But the host did try to help and gave multiple opportunities. The guest's behavior might have disrupted the party, so the host's decision to ask them to leave could be justified.\n\nI think the host is not in the wrong here. They made an effort to integrate the guest, but when the guest didn't reciprocate, the host took action to maintain the party's vibe. The answer is B.\n"
