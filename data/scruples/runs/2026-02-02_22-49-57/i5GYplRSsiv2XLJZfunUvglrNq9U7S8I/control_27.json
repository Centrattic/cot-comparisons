I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party because he wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest was invited as a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help him by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the host made efforts. Eventually, the host told him to leave, and the guest did.\n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the host made efforts to include the guest, but the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. Maybe the guest was shy or awkward. But the host is also responsible for their own party and their time. If someone is just standing around not engaging despite opportunities, maybe the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, is it fair to kick someone out for being shy or not socializing? The guest might have legitimate social anxiety or just not be in the mood. The host's responsibility is to their own event. But is it reasonable to expect guests to make an effort to socialize? Maybe the host should have given more time or encouraged interaction differently.\n\nThe coworker friend said it was \"shitty,\" which might mean the host's response was too harsh. But the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort. The key points are whether the host acted reasonably. They tried to help, but when the guest didn't reciprocate, the host felt justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the host has some responsibility to manage the event. If the guest is disrupting the party or being a burden, it's acceptable. Here, the guest wasn't disruptive but just not socializing. However, the host might be within their rights to ask someone to leave if they're not engaging. So, probably B (not in the wrong). The host tried to help and then set a boundary when efforts failed.\n"
