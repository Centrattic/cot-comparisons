I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host noticed him standing alone and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join a game or mingle. The host got annoyed, told him to leave, and the coworker friend thought it was harsh. The question is whether the host is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party usually involves making guests comfortable, but guests also have a responsibility to engage a bit. The host made efforts to help the guest by talking and introducing him. The guest then withdrew again and refused suggestions. The host might have felt that the guest wasn't making an effort, so they decided to ask him to leave.\n\nBut maybe the guest was just shy or anxious. Could the host have handled it differently, like giving more time or encouraging more gently? However, the host did try a couple of times. Also, the guest might have been expecting others to make an effort, which isn't fair. Parties are social events where guests are expected to interact to some extent. If someone refuses to engage despite being helped, the host might not be obligated to keep them around. The host is also responsible for the overall atmosphere and other guests' enjoyment. \n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh. Maybe the host could have talked to him privately first or given more time. But the host did attempt to assist and then had enough. The coworker friend judged it as \"shitty,\" but the host explained the situation. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made an effort to help, and if the guest still didn't participate, the host has the right to ask them to leave if it's affecting the event. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
