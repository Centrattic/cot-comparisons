I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, came along. He was initially talked to and introduced to someone with similar interests, but after five minutes, he was alone again. He kept saying no one was talking to him, refused to join a game or mingle. The author got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was mean, but the author defended their decision.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points. The guest was given multiple chances: the author spoke to him, introduced him to someone, suggested a game. He refused to engage and kept being passive. The author felt responsible for the event and maybe overwhelmed. But is it wrong to tell someone to leave if they aren't contributing to the social environment?\n\nSocial norms suggest that at a party, guests are expected to participate to some extent. However, the guest might have had valid reasons for not socializing\u2014maybe he's introverted or anxious. But the author had to manage the party and couldn't cater to everyone's needs indefinitely. \n\nThe author's response was firm but perhaps a bit abrupt. But considering the guest wasn't making an effort, maybe it's justified. The fact that the guest was a \"plus one\" not really invited might also play a role. The author might feel they're prioritizing their own event's atmosphere over someone's feelings, but it's their space, so they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully, like giving a warning or checking in later. But the guest was resistant to any suggestions. So the author's decision to ask him to leave might be reasonable. The coworker's reaction indicates some social pressure, but the author might not be in the wrong here. \n\nOverall, the answer would be B (No), because the guest wasn't making an effort, and the author has the right to manage their party. The guest's behavior was passive-aggressive, and the author's actions were a reasonable response to maintain the event's social dynamics.\n"
