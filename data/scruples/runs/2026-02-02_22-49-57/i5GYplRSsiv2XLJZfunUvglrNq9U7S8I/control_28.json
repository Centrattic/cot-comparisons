I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who wasn't officially invited but came with a coworker's friend, started feeling left out. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but he kept being alone. Eventually, the host told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker friend of the guest was upset about that.\n\nSo, the host's actions: made an effort to integrate the guest, gave suggestions, and when the guest didn't engage, asked him to leave. The guest didn't reciprocate the social efforts. The host is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nI should consider social norms. Is it reasonable for a host to expect a guest to socialize? Well, parties are social events, so guests are expected to participate to some extent. However, the host's responsibility is to manage the environment. But if someone is genuinely uncomfortable, maybe the host could have done more. However, in this case, the host did make two attempts. The guest didn't engage after that.\n\nThe guest's behavior might be passive-aggressive or socially awkward. Maybe he's shy, or maybe he's taking advantage. The host's patience was tested when the guest kept standing alone despite being offered help. The host's reaction was to ask him to leave, which could be seen as harsh, but maybe justified since the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nAnother angle: the guest wasn't officially invited as a plus one. Maybe the host felt they had a limited number of guests and couldn't accommodate someone who wasn't contributing. Also, the host's coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the host should have been more accommodating, especially if the guest was a plus one. But since the guest didn't make an effort, the host isn't entirely at fault. The host isn't responsible for making the guest feel included beyond reasonable efforts. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, hosts have the right to manage their parties. If a guest is causing disruption or not participating, removal isn't unreasonable. The host made attempts to include the guest. So, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B (No).\n"
