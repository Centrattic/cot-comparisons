I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who hosted the party is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. So the situation is that the guest came with a coworker, but when asked if he was okay, he said no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone else and suggested joining a game, but he refused. Then the host told him to leave. The host's coworker friend thought it was bad, but the host felt he wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. When you host a party, you're responsible for the environment and the guests' comfort. However, guests are also expected to participate to some extent. The guest in question kept saying he was being ignored, but after being introduced and given options, he didn't engage. The host tried a couple of times to help, but the guest wasn't taking initiative. \n\nSocial events require mutual effort. If someone is there but refuses to interact despite opportunities, maybe the host isn't obligated to force socialization. The host had a right to set boundaries, especially if the guest was making the host uncomfortable or not adhering to the social norms of the event. \n\nBut then again, kicking someone out might seem harsh. However, the guest was given chances to participate and didn't. The host explained their reasoning, and the coworker friend's reaction might be subjective. The host's main point was that they couldn't spend time dragging the guest around. \n\nI think the key points are: the guest wasn't making an effort after being offered help, and the host felt it was necessary to maintain the party's atmosphere. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But maybe there's another angle. Did the guest have any valid reason for not socializing? Maybe social anxiety or shyness. But the host isn't responsible for every guest's personal issues unless they knew about it beforehand. \n\nThe host's approach was to address the issue after multiple attempts. So I still lean towards B. The host isn't in the wrong because the guest wasn't cooperating after being helped.\n"
