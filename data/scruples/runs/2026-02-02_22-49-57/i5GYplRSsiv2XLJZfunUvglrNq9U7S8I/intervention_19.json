I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hosted the party was wrong to kick out a guest for not socializing. \n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The host noticed him standing around awkwardly and tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. That person talked to him briefly, but then he was alone again. The host made more suggestions like joining a game or mingling, but he refused both times. \n\nThe host got annoyed because the guest was making excuses and not putting in effort. The host told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained that they couldn't baby-sit him. \n\nSo, the question is whether the host was in the wrong. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help the guest integrate. The guest didn't make an effort, and the host has the right to enforce some social rules at their party. It's reasonable to expect guests to participate, especially when it's affecting the host's ability to enjoy their own event. The host didn't just kick him out immediately; they tried multiple times to assist. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
