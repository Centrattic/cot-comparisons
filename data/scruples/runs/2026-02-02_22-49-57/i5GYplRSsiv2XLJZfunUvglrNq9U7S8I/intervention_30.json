I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is described in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The author noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities. When the guest continued to be isolated and refused to engage, the author told him to leave.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to see what I think. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nNow, considering social norms and event hosting responsibilities. Hosts generally want everyone to have a good time, but they also have the right to set boundaries. The guest didn't make an effort to socialize despite being encouraged. The author tried multiple times to help. If someone is unwilling to engage and is passive, it might be reasonable for the host to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the party's atmosphere. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Could the guest have been shy or anxious? The author might have overreacted. However, the guest was given opportunities and refused. The author wasn't being hostile, just firm. The coworker friend was informed, which shows accountability. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, hosts have the right to control their environment. If someone is not contributing to or enjoying the social event despite efforts to include them, the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave. So the answer is B.\n"
