I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who kicked a guest out of their party is in the wrong. The situation involves a guest who kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced and given suggestions to socialize.\n\nFirst, the host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but not officially invited. The host tried to help the guest by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. The guest then went back to being alone, and when asked again, he still claimed no one was talking to him. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort and told him to leave.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: they were trying to be helpful, but the guest wasn't engaging. The host might feel that they can't be responsible for everyone's social interactions. The guest's behavior could be seen as expecting others to make the effort, which isn't reasonable. However, the guest might have felt anxious or uncomfortable, making it hard to approach others.\n\nThe host's actions were to address the situation after multiple attempts to integrate the guest. The host's responsibility isn't to force socialization, especially in a private party. The guest chose not to participate beyond the initial help. The host's decision to ask him to leave could be justified if they felt the guest wasn't respecting the social dynamics of the event.\n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, the host had the right to manage their own party. The key points are the attempts to help and the guest's lack of effort. The host isn't obligated to keep someone who isn't contributing to or respecting the social environment.\n"
