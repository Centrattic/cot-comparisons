I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the context: The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't a plus-one. The guest stood around awkwardly, said no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to others and suggesting activities, but the guest refused. Eventually, the host told him to leave if he wasn't going to engage.\n\nNow, the host's perspective: They tried to help, the guest didn't make an effort, so they removed him. The coworker friend (the guest's companion) thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nTo determine if the host is in the wrong, I need to consider social norms and expectations at parties. Hosting a party often involves creating a welcoming environment. Guests are expected to at least make some effort to socialize, even if they're shy. However, it's also the host's right to set boundaries to ensure the event isn't derailed by someone's discomfort.\n\nThe guest's behavior: He came to the party but refused to engage despite being offered help. This could be seen as not respecting the host's effort to include him. On the other hand, some might argue that forcing someone to socialize is unkind, and the host should have been more patient.\n\nThe line between helping a guest and taking responsibility for their social comfort is blurry. The host did make attempts to integrate him, but after repeated refusals, it's reasonable to expect the guest to either make an effort or leave. The host has a right to protect the atmosphere of their party, so kicking someone out who isn't contributing or engaging might be justifiable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host is usually expected to handle situations with some grace. However, in this case, the guest was given multiple chances. The host's actions might be seen as necessary to maintain the party's energy. The coworker friend's judgment isn't necessarily the final word\u2014maybe she's in the guest's camp, but the host's perspective is that the guest wasn't trying.\n\nSo, considering all this, the host isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
