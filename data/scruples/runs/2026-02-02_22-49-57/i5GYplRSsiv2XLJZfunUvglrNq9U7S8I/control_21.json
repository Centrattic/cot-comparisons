I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking a guest to leave their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed the guest standing around awkwardly and tried to help by introducing them to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, refused to join activities, and the host got annoyed, eventually asking them to leave. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the host overstepped by telling the guest to leave. Let's consider the host's perspective: they tried to help the guest integrate, offered suggestions, but the guest didn't engage. The host felt it was their responsibility to maintain the party's atmosphere, and the guest wasn't making an effort. On the other hand, the guest might have been shy or anxious and didn't feel comfortable socializing. The host's response could be seen as abrupt, especially if the guest was just struggling to interact naturally.\n\nBut did the host do anything wrong? They did make an effort to assist the guest initially. The guest's own actions\u2014refusing to mingle or participate\u2014might indicate they weren't interested in the party's activities. The host has the right to manage their own event and ensure it's a positive environment for others. However, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could be seen as harsh, even if the guest was uncooperative. Maybe there was a middle ground, like giving a heads-up first or trying another approach before asking them to leave. But the host's actions were a response to the guest's lack of effort, which is a valid concern. The coworker's reaction might be more about defending the friend than the host's right to act. So, I think the host isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
