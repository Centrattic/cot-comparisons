I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host noticed the guest was awkward, tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest kept standing alone and refused to engage. The host then told him to leave, thinking he wanted attention without effort.\n\nThe key points here are the host's actions and intentions. Did the host give enough support? They tried talking to the guest once, introduced him, suggested a game, and he refused. The host felt the guest wasn't making an effort. The guest's response was that others weren't talking to him, but the host saw that as an excuse. \n\nI should consider social expectations. As a host, it's reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize. However, some people might be shy or anxious. The host's approach was to help initially but then set a boundary when the guest didn't engage. \n\nIs it fair to kick someone out for not socializing? It depends on the context. If the guest was causing trouble or being disruptive, then yes. But here, the issue was passive\u2014just not interacting. The host might have felt overwhelmed, especially if managing the party. \n\nThe coworker friend (the original invitee) might have expected the guest to be included. The host's explanation to her was that the guest wasn't trying. The coworker thought it was harsh, but the host felt justified.\n\nI should also think about whether the host gave enough time and opportunities. They tried a couple of times, but maybe two attempts weren't enough. Alternatively, the guest's refusal to engage despite the suggestions shows lack of effort. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host has some responsibility to ensure guests are comfortable, but they also have the right to set boundaries. The line is blurry here. Kicking someone out for not socializing might seem harsh if the guest is just shy. But if the guest is choosing not to participate despite being offered help, the host's action could be justified. \n\nI think the host's action is understandable. They tried to help, and when the guest didn't reciprocate, they set a boundary. It's not about being mean but about managing the event. So the answer is B, the host is not in the wrong.\n"
