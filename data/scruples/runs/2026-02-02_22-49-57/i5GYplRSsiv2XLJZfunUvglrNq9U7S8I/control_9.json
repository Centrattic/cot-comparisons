I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The situation is that the guest was invited by a coworker but came separately. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept being alone. When the author suggested joining a game or mingling, he refused. The author then told him to leave, and the coworker friend thought it was harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guest claims he's not being talked to, but the author points out he could just approach others. The guest didn't make an effort. The author tried to help twice. Maybe the guest was being passive or expecting others to reach out. The author's party is their space, and if they set a rule that guests should engage or leave, they might be in the right. However, is it fair to kick someone out just for being shy or not socializing enough? Maybe the guest had social anxiety or was just awkward. But the author did try to assist. The key is whether the guest was actively trying. If he kept refusing suggestions, maybe the author isn't wrong. On the other hand, maybe the author could have been more patient. But the author mentions they didn't have time to drag him around. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer depends on whether the guest made any effort to socialize after the initial help. Since he refused both times, the author might not be in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
