I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosted a party, had a guest who was a plus one but not officially invited. The guest seemed awkward, approached the host, got introduced to someone, then ended up alone again. The host tried to help, suggested activities, but the guest refused. Eventually, the host told him to leave, and the guest left. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guest wasn't part of the original invite, he was standoffish despite being offered help, and the host felt he wasn't making an effort. The host's responsibility to their own event and other guests is a factor. Also, the guest's behavior\u2014maybe he was uncomfortable or had social anxiety?\n\nI need to weigh whether the host was in the right. If the guest was making the host uncomfortable by not engaging and affecting the party vibe, maybe the host had the right to ask him to leave. On the other hand, if the guest had a legitimate reason for being awkward, maybe the host should have handled it differently, like being more patient or not being so direct.\n\nBut the host tried to help multiple times. The guest kept isolating himself. The host was hosting their own party, so they have the right to set boundaries. It's possible the guest was expecting others to make more effort towards him, but socializing is a two-way street. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. \n\nHowever, the coworker's friend might have felt it was harsh. But the host's perspective is that they were managing their own event and couldn't take responsibility for the guest's lack of initiative. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host usually has leeway to manage their event. Guests are expected to make some effort. If someone is making the host uncomfortable and not contributing, the host can ask them to leave. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
