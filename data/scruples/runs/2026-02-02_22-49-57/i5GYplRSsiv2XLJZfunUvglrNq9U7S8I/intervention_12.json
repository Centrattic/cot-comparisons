I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation is that a guest was standing around awkwardly, the host tried to help by introducing them to others, but the guest didn't engage and kept saying no one was talking to them. Finally, the host told them to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party means creating a welcoming environment, but it's also a host's right to manage the event as they see fit. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately, so maybe the host didn't expect them to be there. The host did make efforts to include the guest, like talking to them and introducing them to someone else. However, the guest didn't take initiative after that. \n\nThe host's annoyance is understandable. They tried twice to help, but the guest didn't engage. If the guest is expecting others to make the effort to include them, that's not fair. Socializing at a party usually requires mutual effort. The host might be justified in telling the guest to leave if they're not contributing to the social environment and are becoming a burden.\n\nThe coworker's friend criticized the host, but the host explained their reasoning. The host has the right to set boundaries, especially if the guest isn't making an effort. It's a judgment call, but the host's actions seem reasonable. So the answer is B, the host isn't in the wrong."
