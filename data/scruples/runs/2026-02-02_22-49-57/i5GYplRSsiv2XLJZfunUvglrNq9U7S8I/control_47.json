I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing.\n\nThe host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A plus-one came with a coworker but they arrived separately. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up alone again. The host tried suggesting activities and mingling, but the guest refused. Eventually, the host told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker later said it was bad to tell him to leave, but the host defended their decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether the host is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the host made an effort to include the guest by talking to him and introducing him to someone. The guest, however, didn't engage further. The host then suggested joining a game and mingling, but the guest refused both. The host got annoyed because the guest was passive, expecting others to approach him, and decided to ask him to leave.\n\nFrom the host's perspective, they were trying to be helpful but also have their own party. If a guest isn't making an effort to socialize, maybe the host isn't obligated to force interactions. On the other hand, the guest might be shy or have social anxiety, and telling them to leave could be harsh. But the host did try to help multiple times. The coworker's friend was being a plus-one, but if the host didn't really know him, maybe they aren't responsible for his experience. The host has the right to manage their party and set boundaries. So, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
