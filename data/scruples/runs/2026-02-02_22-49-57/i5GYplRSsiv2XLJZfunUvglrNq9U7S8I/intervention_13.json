I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The scenario is that the guest was invited as a plus one but came separately. The host noticed the guest was being awkward, tried to introduce him to others, but he kept isolating himself. Eventually, the host told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the actions of the host and the guest. The host made multiple attempts to help the guest integrate into the party\u2014talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, suggesting activities. The guest, on the other hand, refused to join in and kept standing alone. The host got annoyed because they felt the guest was expecting others to make an effort for him without him contributing. \n\nNow, the question is whether the host was wrong to ask him to leave. From a social responsibility angle, the host is the organizer and might have the right to set boundaries. If a guest is not making an effort to participate and is disrupting the event, the host isn't obligated to keep them around. However, there's also the aspect of social etiquette. Some might argue that the host should have been more patient or found another way to include the guest instead of immediately asking them to leave. \n\nBut the host did try multiple times to assist the guest. The guest's refusal to engage could be seen as a choice that's not the host's fault. The host isn't responsible for everyone's social interactions; guests have to put in their own effort. So, the host's decision to ask him to leave might be justified, especially if the guest's behavior was affecting the host's enjoyment or the party's atmosphere. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since the host made efforts and the guest didn't reciprocate, it's possible the host isn't at fault. The answer might be B.\n"
