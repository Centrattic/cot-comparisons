I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hosted a party and had a guest who kept coming to them saying no one was talking to him. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone else and suggesting activities, but the guest didn't take the initiative. Eventually, the author told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They were hosting a party, probably expecting guests to socialize. When someone is left out or seems uncomfortable, the host might feel responsible. The guest in question was a plus one, but not officially invited, maybe. The author tried to help twice, but the guest didn't engage. The author might feel that it's not their responsibility to constantly intervene, especially if the guest isn't making an effort. They could see it as one-sided, where the guest is expecting others to approach them instead of making their own connections.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker friend is upset, which could mean that the author's actions affected their relationship. The guest might have felt humiliated or unfairly treated. Even if the guest wasn't trying, the author's response of telling them to leave might be seen as harsh. There could be factors like the guest's personality, maybe they were shy or had an anxiety, making it hard for them to socialize in a new environment. The author might not have considered that possibility. \n\nAlso, the author's decision to kick someone out is a strong action. Even if the guest wasn't engaging, the host might have other options, like giving them space or gently encouraging them to participate. The author's frustration is understandable, but the reaction might be too direct. It's a question of responsibility: is it the host's duty to ensure every guest is included, or is it the guest's responsibility to make their own connections?\n\nAnother angle: the guest was a plus one, which might mean they were expected to be there but not necessarily part of the core group. The author might feel that having someone not participate is disruptive. However, the coworker's disapproval (\"shitty to tell him to leave\") suggests that the approach might not be appropriate. The author's coworker might see it as the host overstepping, even if the guest was being uncooperative.\n\nIn terms of the question of \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the action of kicking someone out was justified. The author did try to help, but the guest didn't respond. The key points are whether the author acted unreasonably. If the host's primary responsibility is to their guests and the environment, maybe they have a right to ask someone to leave if they're not meeting the social expectations. However, if the guest was genuinely struggling, the author might have been too quick to act instead of giving more time or support. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they made efforts to include the guest and, when those failed, decided to end the situation. The guest's refusal to engage despite offers could be a factor. But maybe the answer is that they are in the wrong because kicking someone out is a harsh measure. However, in some cases, hosts do have the right to enforce etiquette. It's a bit of a tricky call, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author tried to help and the guest was resistant.\n"
