I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the setup: The party was at the author's house, they invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus-one but not officially invited by the author. He came with a coworker. The author tried twice to help him integrate\u2014first by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests, then suggesting activities. The guest kept being isolated and refused to engage further. The author then told him to leave.\n\nNow, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's responsibility as the host versus the guest's social initiative. The author probably wanted everyone to have fun but might have felt overwhelmed. The guest might have been shy or uncomfortable, but he didn't make efforts to socialize beyond what was offered. \n\nEthically, is it okay to ask someone to leave for not participating? The author tried to help, but if the guest was a burden, maybe it's reasonable. However, the guest might have felt harassed by being told to leave, especially if he was genuinely trying but struggling. Also, the coworker (his friend) was upset, which complicates things. \n\nLegally, as the host, the author can ask anyone to leave if they're not following the rules. Socially, it's more nuanced. The author might be in the right if they felt they couldn't manage the situation anymore, but some might see it as harsh. The key points are the attempts to integrate the guest and the guest's lack of initiative. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help, and the guest wasn't making an effort. So answer B.\n"
