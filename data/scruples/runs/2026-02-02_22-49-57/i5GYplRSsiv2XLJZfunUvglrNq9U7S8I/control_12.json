I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers, and there was a guest who was a friend of a coworker. The coworker brought the guest, but they arrived separately. The guest seemed to be socially awkward, the host tried to help by introducing him to someone, but he kept being alone. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort and told him to leave. The coworker thought it was mean, but the host argued that it's not their responsibility to drag people around to socialize.\n\nSo, the host's actions: tried to help once, then again, but when the guest refused to engage, told him to leave. The coworker friend disagreed, but the host felt they couldn't spend time forcing interaction.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Legal terms might not apply here, but socially, is it acceptable? Well, hosting a party gives the host some authority over the environment. If the guest is not following social norms, like being uncooperative, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave. However, the guest might have had reasons for being uncomfortable. The host did try to help, but maybe could have been more patient. However, the guest was given multiple chances and refused to participate. \n\nIn social situations, people can have boundaries. If someone is not respecting the host's effort to include them and is just being passive, the host might not be wrong in removing them. Also, the coworker's friend's criticism might be a red herring; the host's main responsibility is to their own event. The key points are: host tried to help, guest didn't reciprocate, host set a boundary. So B (not in the wrong) seems likely. But maybe there's a nuance. Could the host have handled it differently? Maybe, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. So probably B.\n"
