I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus-one but not officially invited, came separately, and kept standing around saying no one was talking to him. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone else and suggesting activities, but the guest refused. Then the author told him to leave.\n\nSo, first, the guest wasn't even a direct invitee, just someone the coworker brought along. The author might feel responsible because they invited the coworker, but maybe they have a right to set boundaries. The guest's behavior was passive; instead of making an effort to engage, he waited for others to approach him. The author tried to help twice and then offered options. The coworker friend was defensive, but the author explained they couldn't be a personal assistant.\n\nThe question is whether it's fair to kick someone out for not socializing. Social gatherings often require some level of participation. If someone is there but not engaging and is a burden, the host can set limits. The author might be in the right because they provided opportunities and then asked the guest to leave after he didn't participate. However, maybe the author could have handled it more politely or given more time. But given the circumstances, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
