I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest ended up alone again, refused to join a game, and the host told him to leave.\n\nSo, the question is whether the host was wrong to kick out the guest. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the host made an effort to include the guest. They talked to him, introduced him to someone, even suggested activities. The guest, however, didn't take initiative and kept being passive. The host might have been trying to manage the party and other guests, not wanting to spend all their time on one person. It's possible they felt the guest was being uncooperative.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest had social anxiety or wasn't comfortable. The host's approach might have been too abrupt. Even if the guest wasn't trying, the host could have handled it differently, like giving more time or involving others to help. Also, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could come off as harsh, especially if the guest was just shy.\n\nBut the host did make multiple attempts to integrate the guest. If the guest refused all suggestions and kept isolating himself, maybe the host was right to enforce boundaries. Parties are social events, and if someone isn't participating and is a burden, maybe the host is justified in asking them to leave to maintain the atmosphere.\n\nAnother angle: the host's responsibility versus the guest's responsibility. The host tried; if the guest isn't willing to put in any effort, the host isn't obligated to keep trying. However, the method of kicking them out might be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely struggling socially.\n\nThe coworker (the friend) who brought the guest might have felt the host was too abrupt. But the host explained their reasoning, so the coworker understands. It's possible the host was within their rights as the host of the event to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing or causing issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the host made efforts to include the guest, but when the guest refused to engage, the host decided to remove them. If the guest was being uncooperative despite help, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. But some might argue it's harsh to kick someone out over not socializing. However, given that the host tried and the guest didn't reciprocate, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
