I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing. The host tried twice to help the guest connect with others, but the guest refused both times. Then the host asked him to leave, and the coworker (who is the friend of the guest) thought it was bad, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They organized the party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest wasn't a plus-one but was brought by a coworker. The host tried to integrate him by conversing and introducing him to someone. When that didn't work, the host suggested joining a game and mingling. The guest refused both times. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort, so they asked him to leave. The host's main points are that the guest wasn't trying to socialize and expected others to make the effort for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt uncomfortable or anxious. Maybe he was there as a plus-one and wasn't expecting to be the center of attention. The fact that he approached the host twice to say he wasn't talking to anyone suggests he was struggling. However, the host did their part by helping twice. The guest didn't follow through. The host's party is their space, so they have the right to set boundaries. If someone isn't respecting the social environment or making an effort, the host can decide to ask them to leave. \n\nBut some might argue that the host should be more accommodating, especially if the guest was part of a coworker's invite. However, the host also has the responsibility to manage their own event and ensure it's enjoyable for everyone. If someone is causing discomfort by not participating and expecting others to adjust, the host isn't in the wrong for asking them to leave after reasonable attempts to help. The coworker's disapproval might be because they didn't expect the guest to be rejected, but the host's actions were to maintain the party's social dynamics. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the host tried to assist the guest, gave him opportunities, and when he still didn't engage, the host made a decision to maintain the event. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
