I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came along as a plus one but not officially. The host tried to help the guest by introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join activities, and the host told him to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was mean, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the host is in the wrong. The host made an effort to include the guest initially. They spoke to him, introduced him, and suggested activities. The guest, however, didn't engage further, stood around, and didn't make an effort to socialize despite being given opportunities. The host's annoyance is understandable, as they were trying to manage the party and couldn't spend all their time on one person. \n\nThe key points here are the host's attempts to help versus the guest's lack of initiative. The host isn't obligated to force someone to socialize, especially if the guest isn't making an effort. However, kicking someone out might be seen as harsh, but if the guest was disruptive or not part of the original invite, it could be justified. The host also considered the party's environment and their own capacity to manage the situation.\n\nThe coworker's reaction might be a point of contention. The host had to make a call to maintain the party's atmosphere. Since the guest was a plus one who wasn't part of the initial invite, the host might feel they have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the event. The guest's behavior (refusing to join games, not engaging) could be seen as self-pitying, which the host had to address.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. Here, the host tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's actions, while direct, were in response to the guest's lack of effort. So the answer likely leans towards the host not being in the wrong (B). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing, like if the guest had a valid reason for being awkward (e.g., social anxiety), but the post doesn't mention that. Based on the given info, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
