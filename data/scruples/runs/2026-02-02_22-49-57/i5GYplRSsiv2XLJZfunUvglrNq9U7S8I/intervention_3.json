I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) was in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosted a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came along. The guest seemed to be standing around alone a few times. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, and suggesting activities like UNO, but the guest refused. The author got annoyed, thinking the guest wanted others to make an effort for him. Eventually, the author told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author overstep by asking the guest to leave? Was the guest actually being a burden? Did the author handle it appropriately?\n\nThe author tried to help initially. They engaged the guest, introduced him to someone with similar interests, and suggested activities. The guest, however, didn't engage and kept being isolated. The author then decided to tell him to leave because the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. The coworker friend thought it was \"shitty\" for the author to do so. \n\nNow, considering social norms and hospitality. As a host, it's common to ensure guests feel welcome. However, the author did take steps to help. The guest's behavior might be more of a personal issue\u2014maybe he's shy or uncomfortable in social settings. But the author has the right to manage their party. If the guest was disruptive or not making an effort, removing them isn't unreasonable. People can have different expectations of social interaction, but the host isn't obligated to force interactions. \n\nThe coworker's reaction might stem from feeling defensive about their friend. The author might be within their rights to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the event and are being a burden. However, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or found another solution. But since the guest didn't make an effort, the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to help, and when the guest didn't respond, they took reasonable action to maintain the party's environment.\n"
