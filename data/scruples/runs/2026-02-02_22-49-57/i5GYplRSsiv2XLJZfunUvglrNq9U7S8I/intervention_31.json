I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a party, and a guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one. The guest seemed awkward and kept saying others weren't talking to him. The author tried to help by chatting and introducing him to a friend, but the guest ended up alone again. When the author suggested joining a game or mingling, he refused. Then the author told him to leave.\n\nSo, why might the author be right? They tried to help, but the guest didn't make an effort. The author's party is their space, and they have the right to enforce some social expectations. If someone's presence is making the event uncomfortable and they're not contributing, removing them could be justified.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the guest was just shy or overwhelmed. The author could have given more time or support. Also, the coworker (his friend) might feel embarrassed, which adds another layer. The author's approach was direct, but was it necessary?\n\nThe key points are the guest's refusal to engage despite opportunities and the host's responsibility to manage their event. The author might argue they're not responsible for making someone social, just providing a space. The guest might feel unfairly judged, but the author isn't obligated to spend the whole night ensuring his comfort.\n\nIn terms of social norms, hosts do sometimes have to manage difficult guests. If someone is a problem, asking them to leave is acceptable. The author's reasoning\u2014that the guest wasn't making an effort\u2014is a valid perspective. However, the coworker's reaction suggests some sensitivity here. Still, the author's party, their rules. I think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
