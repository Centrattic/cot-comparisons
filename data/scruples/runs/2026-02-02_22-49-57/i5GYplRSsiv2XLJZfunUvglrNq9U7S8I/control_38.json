I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where the host kicked out a guest for not socializing. The guest was a plus one, not invited directly, and the host tried to help him integrate but eventually asked him to leave when he didn't engage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The host made an effort to introduce the guest to others and suggested activities, but the guest kept standing alone. The host felt the guest wasn't making an effort and that it was a self-pity act. The coworker (the guest's plus one) was upset about the ejection.\n\nSo, from an etiquette perspective, is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is socializing? Or is it the guest's responsibility to make their own connections? The host did try to help, but maybe after a few attempts, it's reasonable to expect the guest to take initiative. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might be harsh. Parties are social events, but some people might be shy or introverted. The host might have overstepped by forcing the issue.\n\nAlso, the guest was a plus one, which could mean they were not part of the host's usual circle, so maybe the host felt less responsible. But still, being a guest at a party, even as a plus one, doesn't mean they should be ostracized. The host's reaction was out of frustration, but was it fair? The host could have handled it differently, like offering to leave with the guest if they were uncomfortable, instead of making them go out immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, the host is managing their event and might have felt that the guest was not contributing to the positive atmosphere. If the guest was disruptive or refusing to participate, the host has the right to ask them to leave. But in this case, the guest was just standing alone and not engaging, which isn't necessarily disruptive. The line between being a poor socializer and being a problem attendee is thin.\n\nThe coworker's reaction might indicate that the host's action was too harsh. The host could have been more understanding, considering that social anxiety is a real thing. However, the host also had the right to set boundaries for their own event. So it's a bit of a gray area. The host tried to help but eventually felt it was the guest's responsibility. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal opinions on social etiquette.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The host made some effort, but the final action of kicking out might be seen as harsh. Alternatively, the guest didn't make an effort to integrate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the host's actions were within their right to manage their party. But if the host was too quick to eject someone for being shy, then A (in the wrong). Hmm.\n"
