I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but came separately. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests, but after a couple of interactions where the guest went back to being alone and refused to join activities, the author told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations. Hosting a party usually means creating a welcoming environment, but it's also the host's space. The guest was invited, but maybe as a plus one. The author made efforts to include him. When the guest didn't engage despite being offered opportunities, maybe the author felt it was their right to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh. The guest might have had a legitimate reason for being awkward\u2014maybe shyness, anxiety, or just not being into the type of party. The author's frustration is understandable, but should a host be responsible for ensuring every guest interacts? \n\nThe friend (the coworker) thought it was shitty, which adds a perspective that others might see it as rude. The author's explanation about not having time to drag him around to talk to people is valid, but perhaps there's a better way to handle it without making the guest leave. Maybe giving the guest more space or understanding that not everyone is comfortable in social settings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is the host and can set the tone. If the guest was unresponsive and not contributing to the social environment, it's reasonable to expect some effort from the guest to participate. The author might not be in the wrong if they felt the guest wasn't respecting the party's social nature. Still, the action of kicking someone out could be seen as extreme. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between the host's responsibility and the guest's autonomy. The author did try to include the guest, but after multiple refusals, maybe they had a right to ask him to leave if it was affecting the party. But others might argue that it's not the host's place to judge social skills. The key points are the efforts made by the host and the guest's resistance. The author might not be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. The answer could be B (No), but I need to be careful here. Let me check again. The host tried twice to help, the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's time is limited, and they can't be responsible for every guest's socializing. So, B seems plausible.\n"
