I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but came separately with a coworker. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept standing alone and refused to engage further. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party often involves ensuring guests feel welcome, but it's not the host's duty to force social interactions. The host did make an effort by talking to the guest and setting up an introduction. The guest's refusal to engage after being offered options might indicate he wasn't interested in participating. \n\nThe host's right to set boundaries is important. If someone is not contributing to the social environment and the host feels it's affecting the event, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. However, there's a nuance here: the guest might have personal reasons for not socializing, like shyness or social anxiety. The host might not have considered that the guest could be struggling but not making the effort. \n\nOn the other hand, the host isn't obligated to act as a personal social coordinator. It's the guest's responsibility to engage if they're there. The host's actions were a last resort after multiple attempts to include the guest. The coworker's reaction might be about defending her friend, which could cloud judgment. \n\nSo, the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and set a boundary when efforts failed. The guest's unwillingness to participate despite being given opportunities justifies the host's decision. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
