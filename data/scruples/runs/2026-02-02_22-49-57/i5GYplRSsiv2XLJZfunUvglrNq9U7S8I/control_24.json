I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, the context: The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The guest kept standing alone, claimed no one was talking to him, even after the host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests and suggesting he join a game. Then the guest refused to mingle or participate. The host got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nNow, I need to consider the host's perspective. Hosting a party requires effort, and the host is responsible for the environment. If someone is not making an effort to socialize despite being offered help, it might be a problem. The host's main role is to make guests comfortable, but if a guest refuses to engage and is just being passive, maybe that's on the guest. The host has the right to set boundaries, especially if the guest is making the host uncomfortable or not respecting the social norms of the event.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have legitimate social anxiety or just be shy. The host tried to help, but maybe there's a line between not socializing and being a burden. The host might have escalated the situation quickly by telling him to leave. However, the host did explain their reasoning to the guest's friend, so they tried to be fair.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected that guests at a party at least make an effort to participate. If someone is clearly not engaging and requires constant attention, the host is within their rights to ask them to leave, especially if they're making the host stressed or the event less enjoyable for others. \n\nSo, considering all this, the host's actions might be justified. They tried to help, and when the guest didn't reciprocate, removing them could be seen as necessary. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
