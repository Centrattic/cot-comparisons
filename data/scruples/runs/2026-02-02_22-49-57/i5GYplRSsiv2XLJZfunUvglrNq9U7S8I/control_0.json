I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was wrong. So the situation is a party where one guest is being awkward and not socializing. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But then the guest keeps standing alone, refuses to join games or mingle. The host gets annoyed and tells him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They threw the party to have people socialize, right? If someone's not engaging, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave, especially if they're not making an effort. The guest was given a chance to interact but declined. The host might feel that their event is being disrupted by someone who isn't participating and is instead expecting others to make an effort.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or nervous. The host tried to help once, but maybe they could have done more? But the guest refused further suggestions. Also, the host mentions that the guest's friend (the coworker) was okay with the friend coming, but maybe the host didn't have to tolerate someone who was being difficult. Parties are for everyone's enjoyment, and if someone is making it uncomfortable for others, removing them makes sense.\n\nThe key points are: the guest was given multiple opportunities to socialize but didn't take them. The host tried to assist but wasn't obligated to keep doing so. The guest's behavior might have been passive-aggressive or expecting others to fix his social issues. The host's main responsibility is to their own event and the comfort of the other guests. So, asking someone to leave if they're not participating and causing disruption isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But wait, could there be a middle ground? Maybe the host could have talked to the coworker first instead of just the guest. But the guest was given a chance, and the host felt justified. So, probably B.\n"
