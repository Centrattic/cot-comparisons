I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they had a party, and a guest came along with a coworker. The guest started feeling left out, and when the host tried to help, the guest didn't engage. Eventually, the host asked the guest to leave, and now they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They threw the party, so maybe they have a duty to make sure guests feel included. But the guest was a plus one, not directly invited. The host helped him connect with someone else, but the guest just stood around again. The host tried suggesting activities and mingling, but the guest refused. \n\nThe host got annoyed because the guest was passive and maybe expecting others to approach him. The host then asked him to leave, which led to the coworker (his friend) being upset. The coworker thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the host make a reasonable effort to include the guest? Yes, they talked to him, introduced him to someone, suggested activities. The guest didn't reciprocate effort. Host's party, so they have the right to set boundaries. The guest's behavior was maybe being difficult or expecting others to accommodate him without trying. \n\nBut is it the host's fault? The host isn't obligated to force interactions. If the guest didn't want to participate, they could have left on their own. The host was trying to help, but when that didn't work, enforcing the situation by asking to leave might be justified. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the host could have handled it more kindly, but the guest's refusal to engage could be seen as the issue. The host's main responsibility is to their own event, and if someone isn't contributing or participating, maybe they're not at fault for asking them to leave. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The guest wasn't making an effort, and the host tried to help. It's reasonable to ask someone to leave if they're not engaging and it's affecting the party.\n"
