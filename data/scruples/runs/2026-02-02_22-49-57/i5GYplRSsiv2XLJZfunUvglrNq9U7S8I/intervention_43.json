I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help the guest by talking to them and introducing them to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up isolated again. The host got annoyed and told the guest to leave if they're just going to stand around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party often involves making guests feel welcome, but it's also reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize. The guest in question didn't seem to take initiative after being introduced. The host tried twice to help, but the guest didn't follow through. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the guest being a plus one. If they were invited as a plus one but didn't come with the coworker, maybe they didn't have a strong connection to the group. The host might not have a duty to constantly check in on them. \n\nThe guest's behavior could be seen as passive or maybe even rude. If they were uncomfortable, perhaps they should have engaged in group activities or approached others. The host's frustration is understandable, especially if they were managing the party and couldn't spend all their time with one person. \n\nThe coworker friend (the host's acquaintance) might have felt the host was too harsh, but the host didn't kick the guest out immediately. They gave time and attempts to integrate. The guest didn't make the effort, so the host decided to set boundaries. \n\nIs it fair for the host to ask them to leave if they're not contributing to the social environment? The host isn't responsible for the guest's discomfort, but maybe should have handled it more gently. However, the guest's actions might have made the host feel the party was being disrupted. \n\nIn the end, the host had the right to enforce some rules, especially if the guest was making themself uncomfortable. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But some might argue that the host should have been more patient. However, the attempts to help were made, and the guest's refusal to engage could justify the host's decision.\n"
