I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one, but not officially. He came with a coworker's friend. The host noticed him standing alone and tried twice to help him socialize\u2014talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting games. However, the guest then went back to being alone, refused to join activities when asked, and kept saying no one was talking to him. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend of the host thought it was bad to tell him to leave, but the host explained that he wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, considering the host's actions, they tried to help the guest integrate but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere and other guests' experiences. However, is it fair to kick someone out for not socializing? On one hand, the host tried to assist, and the guest's behavior was passive. On the other, socializing is a personal choice, and even if someone is awkward, it's not their fault. The host might have overstepped by not giving the guest more time or understanding that social anxiety could be a factor. The host could have handled it more gracefully, like offering a drink or gently encouraging again, instead of demanding to leave. So maybe the host is in the wrong because pushing someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest had valid reasons. But if the guest was disruptive or uncooperative, the host's decision might be justified. The key points are the host's attempts to help and the guest's lack of effort. However, the line between helping and being inconsiderate is thin. The answer might depend on cultural norms or party expectations. If the party's purpose is social interaction, the host has a right to enforce that. But if the guest is just not interested, the host shouldn't force them. Since the host tried twice and the guest refused, maybe it's a mutual issue. The host's frustration is understandable, but kicking someone out could be seen as harsh. So the host might have overreacted. Therefore, the answer could be A (the host is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the host made a reasonable effort and the guest was uncooperative, maybe it's justified. Hmm. Need to think again. The host is responsible for the party, but guests have the right to choose how they interact. The host didn't force the guest to leave but gave him an ultimatum. Maybe the host shouldn't have done that. So the answer is A.\n"
