I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking out a guest from a party because he wasn't socializing. I need to evaluate the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the host organized a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed he was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest was alone again, refused suggestions to join a game or mingle, and then the host told him to leave. The coworker friend of the guest thought it was harsh, but the host defended their decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the host was reasonable in their actions. The guest was given multiple chances to socialize but didn't take them. The host tried to help, but when the guest wasn't making an effort, the host decided to ask him to leave. The host might be in the right because they were managing their own party and couldn't be responsible for every guest's social interactions. However, some might argue that the host overreacted, especially if the guest had social anxiety or other reasons for not engaging. But since the guest refused all offers to participate and was being passive, the host's decision might be justified. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether it's expected for a host to ensure all guests are socializing. Since the host can't control others' behavior and the guest wasn't following through on opportunities provided, B (Not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
