I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing. The author had a party, noticed a guest was being awkward, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but the guest kept being alone again. The author got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guest was a plus one but not officially invited, which might mean they weren't expected to be there. The author tried to help twice, but the guest didn't make an effort. The author's main point is that the guest was not trying to socialize and was being passive. The guest's friend (the coworker) thought it was harsh, but the author explained their reasoning.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. It's common to expect guests at a party to at least make some effort to interact. If someone is clearly uncomfortable but doesn't try to engage, the host might feel they can't accommodate that. However, kicking someone out can be seen as harsh. But the author tried to help first. Maybe the issue is that the guest was not making an effort, so the host's responsibility isn't to force socialization. \n\nAlso, the guest was a plus one, which might mean they weren't part of the main group. The host's job is to manage the event and ensure it's enjoyable for everyone. If someone is causing discomfort or not participating, the host might feel justified in removing them. But some might argue that it's better to be more patient or offer more help.\n\nI should also think about the response from the coworker. The coworker found it shitty, but the author explained their reasoning. Maybe the coworker didn't consider the effort the guest wasn't making. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key factors are: the host's attempts to help, the guest's lack of effort, and the host's right to control their event. The host isn't obligated to force guests to socialize but can ask them to leave if they're not contributing and causing issues. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
