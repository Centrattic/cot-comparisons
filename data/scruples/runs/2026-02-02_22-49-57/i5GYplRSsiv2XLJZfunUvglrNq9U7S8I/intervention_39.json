I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong when they kicked a guest out of their party for not socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but wasn't really a plus one. He kept standing around and claimed no one was talking to him, even after the host tried to introduce him to others. The host got annoyed and told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize.\n\nHmm, so the key points here: the guest was invited by a coworker, the host tried to help him by introducing him to a friend with similar interests, but after a short conversation, the guest was back to standing alone. The host suggested joining a game and mingling, but the guest refused. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker (the friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nI need to determine if the host was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The host made efforts to help the guest integrate, like introducing him and suggesting activities. The guest, however, wasn't making an effort to socialize beyond just saying he's not being talked to. The host's party was for socializing, and if someone is not engaging and is making a burden on the host, is it reasonable to ask them to leave?\n\nOn one hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gently, but the guest wasn't trying. On the other, the host is hosting their own party and has the right to set boundaries. The guest might have been socially awkward, but the host isn't obligated to constantly babysit someone who isn't making an effort. The coworker's reaction is also a point\u2014she thought it was bad, but maybe she didn't see the context where the guest wasn't trying. \n\nI think the host is not in the wrong. They tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host can enforce social participation if that's part of the party's vibe. So answer B.\n"
