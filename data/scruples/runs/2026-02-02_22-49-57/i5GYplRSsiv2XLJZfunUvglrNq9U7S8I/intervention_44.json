I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

They think the author isn't in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came separately. The author tried to help the guest by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But after two attempts, the guest kept standing alone and refused to mingle or join games. The author then told the guest to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the guest's passiveness versus the host's responsibility. The host made efforts to include the guest, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host might feel it's unreasonable to force others to engage. However, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest felt anxious or just needed more time. The coworker (the friend) might be upset because the host was abrupt, but the host had the right to set boundaries for their own event. It's a bit of a judgment call. The host isn't in the wrong for enforcing some rules, but maybe could have handled it more gracefully. Still, the answer is likely B for No.\n"
