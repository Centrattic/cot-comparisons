I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the party host was wrong to kick out a guest who wasn't socializing. The host tried to help the guest by introducing him to others and suggesting activities, but the guest kept being passive. The host finally told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, the host had a responsibility to ensure everyone had a good time, but also to manage the event. The guest was invited as a plus one but maybe didn't integrate well. The host tried to help, so that's good. But when the guest kept being unresponsive, the host felt justified in asking him to leave. \n\nSome might argue that the host should have given more time or been more understanding of the guest's discomfort. Others might say that if someone isn't making an effort, it's reasonable to ask them to leave to protect the vibe of the party. The coworker friend's reaction (\"shitty to tell him to leave\") shows some conflict. But the host explains that they can't be responsible for the guest's awkwardness. \n\nConsidering social norms, parties require some level of participation. If someone is there but not engaging despite help, the host isn't necessarily wrong to set boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
