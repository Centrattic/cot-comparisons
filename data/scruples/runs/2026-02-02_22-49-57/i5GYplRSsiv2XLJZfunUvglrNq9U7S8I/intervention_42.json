I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the host organized a party and invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but not officially invited. He showed up, but he kept standing around and said no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but that didn't last. The guest then refused to join activities or mingle. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was bad, but the host explained the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here: The guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. He was a plus one, maybe not expecting to be the center of attention. The host tried to help twice. The guest's behavior might be passive-aggressive or expecting others to make the effort. The host has the right to set boundaries at their own party. The coworker's reaction is subjective, but the host's actions were in response to the guest's lack of effort. The host isn't responsible for making everyone comfortable beyond reasonable help. So, I think the host is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
