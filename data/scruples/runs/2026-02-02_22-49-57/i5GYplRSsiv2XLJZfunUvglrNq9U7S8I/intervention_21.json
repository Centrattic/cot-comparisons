I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party and noticed a guest who kept standing alone. They tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but he kept saying no one was talking to him even after interactions. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. Hosts generally want their guests to enjoy themselves, but they also have the right to manage their event. If a guest is not engaging, it's reasonable to try to help them socialize. However, when the guest continues to isolate despite efforts, the host might feel it's affecting the party's vibe. \n\nThe key points here are that the host made multiple attempts to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, refused to participate in suggested activities and didn't make an initiative to mingle. The host's frustration is understandable, especially if they're trying to keep the event positive for others. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the host tried to be helpful, the guest's lack of effort could be seen as the main issue. However, telling someone to leave might come off as abrupt. But given the circumstances, maybe the host had a right to set boundaries. \n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or situational factors. Maybe the guest was shy or had social anxiety, which the host didn't account for. But the guest didn't mention that, and the host did make attempts to help. \n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? They didn't act out of malice; they tried to assist and gave the guest chances. The guest's refusal to engage could justify the host's decision. But some might argue that the host should have been more patient. \n\nOverall, I think the host isn't in the wrong because they made efforts to include the guest and the guest's behavior was a problem. The answer is B.\n"
