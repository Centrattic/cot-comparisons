I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing at their party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party and noticed a guest (a plus one of a coworker) standing alone. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. However, the guest kept isolating himself and claimed no one was talking to him despite previous interactions. The host got annoyed and told him to leave, leading to the coworker criticizing the host's decision.\n\nNow, considering the host's actions: They did make an effort to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, didn't reciprocate by initiating conversations or joining activities. The host's party was for friends and coworkers, and while it's a social event, guests should contribute to the social environment. The host didn't force the guest out immediately but gave multiple chances. When the guest showed no willingness to engage, the host decided to ask him to leave, which can be seen as reasonable to maintain the party's atmosphere.\n\nThe coworker's reaction is interesting. They called it \"shitty,\" but the host explained the situation. The host's responsibility isn't to constantly drag the guest around to mingle, especially if the guest isn't making an effort. Parties require some level of self-initiated social interaction. The guest's behavior might be due to shyness or personal issues, but the host isn't obligated to accommodate that indefinitely.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. Kicking someone out can feel harsh, even if justified. But the host had a right to set boundaries for their event. The guest's refusal to engage despite suggestions could disrupt the party's vibe. The host's actions were proactive to prevent the party from becoming awkward for others.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was a reasonable response. The host acted after multiple attempts to include the guest. The guest's refusal to participate beyond initial help shows a lack of effort. Therefore, the host isn't in the wrong here.\n"
