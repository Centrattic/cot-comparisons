I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked the guest out is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where a guest was not socializing. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but the guest kept isolating himself.\n\nFirst, consider the host's perspective. They organized the party, made efforts to include the guest, but when those efforts didn't work, they got annoyed. The host felt that the guest was being passive-aggressive or expecting others to fix the situation. They asked the guest to leave because he wasn't making an effort. \n\nOn the other hand, the guest might feel that he was uncomfortable and tried to seek help, which the host provided. But after being introduced, he still felt left out. The host's decision to ask him to leave could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest had social anxiety or wasn't in the right frame of mind to socialize.\n\nBut the host isn't responsible for making everyone at the party happy. They have a right to set boundaries, especially if someone is not contributing to the social environment. The host tried multiple times to assist, and when it didn't work, they decided to end the situation. \n\nI think the key here is that the host made a reasonable effort to help, and when that failed, they acted in their own best interest. The guest's refusal to engage despite opportunities to do so might justify the host's decision. So the answer is more on the side of the host not being in the wrong.\n"
