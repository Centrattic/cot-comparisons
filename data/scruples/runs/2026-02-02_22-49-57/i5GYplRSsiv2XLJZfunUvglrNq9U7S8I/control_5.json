I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. I need to decide between A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The host had a party, a guest came with a coworker but wasn't a plus one. The guest seemed awkward, said no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but after that, the guest was alone again. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. Then the host got annoyed, thinking the guest wanted everyone to make an effort for him, so they told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host justified it by saying they didn't have time to help further.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. The host tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to someone. The guest didn't take the initiative beyond that. The host's party is their space, and they have the right to set boundaries. However, forcing someone to leave because they're not socializing might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the host isn't obligated to keep someone who's not engaging. The guest might have felt uncomfortable, but the host made reasonable attempts to include him. The main question is whether the host overstepped by asking them to leave when the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nPossible angles: The host's responsibility vs. the guest's responsibility. The host isn't a social manager, but they might expect guests to make some effort. The guest's refusal to engage after being offered help could justify the host's action. Also, the host's party, so they can set rules. But maybe the host should have given more time or a gentler approach. However, the host did try twice and the guest didn't reciprocate. In that case, the host isn't in the wrong. So probably answer B.\n"
