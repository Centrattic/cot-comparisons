I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again and complained about not being talked to. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. The host then asked him to leave.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the host's actions and the guest's behavior. The host did make an effort to include the guest, but the guest didn't take initiative. The host was hosting their own party and had the right to manage the environment. If the guest was making others uncomfortable by being a wallflower or causing disruption, the host's action might be justified. But is it wrong to ask someone to leave if they aren't engaging? \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. But the guest wasn't making an effort, which is on them. The host's responsibility is to their own event. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
