I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The author had a party, noticed a guest was awkward, tried to help by introducing him to someone, but when he kept being alone and refused to engage, the author told him to leave. The coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the author defended their decision.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about social responsibility and boundaries. The guest was invited as a plus one but came separately. The author tried twice to help him integrate but he didn't reciprocate. The author felt annoyed because the guest was expecting others to make an effort for him without trying himself. Then the author told him to leave. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Parties are social events, and guests are generally expected to participate to some extent. If someone is not making an effort to engage, the host might have the right to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the atmosphere. However, the author did try to help, so maybe their actions were justified. On the other hand, maybe the guest had valid reasons for being shy, and the author could have been more patient. But the guest refused all suggestions to socialize. \n\nThe coworker friend thought it was bad, but the author explained their reasoning. It's possible that the author is within their rights as the host to set boundaries. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I should make sure not to judge based on assumptions. The guest might have had social anxiety, but the author can't be responsible for everyone's feelings. The host's time is also important. So probably B.\n"
