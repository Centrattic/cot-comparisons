I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nHmm. Let me break down the scenario. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but was kind of a plus one. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest said no one was talking to him again later, even after being introduced. The host suggested games and mingling, but the guest refused. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party means creating a welcoming environment, but guests also have some responsibility to engage. The host made an effort to help the guest by talking and introducing them. If the guest is still isolated despite efforts, maybe the host isn't obligated to force socialization. However, kicking someone out might be harsh. The guest might have had valid reasons for not socializing\u2014maybe shyness, anxiety, or other issues. The host's frustration is understandable, but is it reasonable to kick someone out for not being social enough?\n\nThe host's actions: They tried twice to help. When the guest didn't engage, the host told them to leave. The coworker friend thought it was harsh. The host argues they didn't have time to drag him around. So, is it fair to tell someone to leave for not making effort to socialize?\n\nI think the key points are: Did the host do enough to help? Did the guest make an effort? The host did try twice. The guest didn't take the initiative beyond saying he was ignored. The host's right to ask someone to leave if they're disruptive? If the person wasn't causing trouble, just not socializing, is it a valid reason? Maybe not. However, the host has the authority to manage their party. But is it right to kick someone out for not socializing? It's a judgment call. If the guest was being a burden, maybe. But maybe the host could have handled it more gently. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. In some views, the host is responsible for everyone's comfort. In others, guests need to take some initiative. The line between helping and being forced to help is tricky. The host's frustration is valid, but the action of kicking someone out might be seen as harsh. So, the author might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the host felt it was necessary, maybe not. I'm a bit torn. The guest might have been a plus one, so maybe expected to integrate. But the host isn't responsible for every guest's social interaction. I think the answer could be A or B. But based on the scenario, the host tried, and the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's decision might be justified. So maybe B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
