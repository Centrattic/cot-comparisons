I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. He kept standing around, said no one was talking to him, even after the host introduced him to someone. The host tried to get him to join a game or mingle, but he refused. The host then told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers, and there was a guest who was a plus one. The host tried to help the guest by introducing him to someone else with similar interests, but the guest didn't take the initiative. The host was frustrated because the guest was passively expecting others to approach him instead of making an effort. The host's reasoning was that if the guest wasn't trying to socialize, then he shouldn't be there. \n\nNow, the key points here are: the guest was a plus one, so maybe not the host's primary responsibility. The host made an effort to help him, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's party is their space, and they can set boundaries. However, did the host overreact? Telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely trying to fit in. But considering the guest's refusal to participate and the host's own time constraints, maybe it's understandable. \n\nAlso, the coworker (the friend) was the one who said it was \"shitty,\" but the host explained their reasoning. The host might not be in the wrong because they did try to help and then had the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing or following the party's social norms. However, maybe there's a middle ground. The host could have been more patient or found another way to integrate the guest. But given the circumstances, the host's actions might be justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intentions and efforts. The host tried to assist, but the guest remained unengaged. The host's party is their own, so they have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not respecting the social environment. So the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the guest was just shy and the host was too quick to act. But since the guest refused to take any initiative after being offered help, the host's decision seems reasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B. The host isn't in the wrong because they made an effort to help and then set a boundary when the guest didn't make an effort. The guest's responsibility was to engage, and the host couldn't be the sole social coordinator. So the author is in the right.\n"
