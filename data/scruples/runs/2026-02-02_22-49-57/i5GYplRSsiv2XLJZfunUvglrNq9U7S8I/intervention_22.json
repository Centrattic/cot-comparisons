I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The scenario is that the guest was a plus one from a coworker but arrived separately. The host noticed the guest was standing alone, tried to help by introducing him to someone, but the guest kept isolating himself. After multiple attempts, the host told him to leave if he's just going to stand around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They had a party, invited friends and coworkers, and wanted everyone to enjoy. When someone is clearly not engaging, it can be frustrating, especially if they're not making an effort to interact. The host tried to help by talking to the guest and introducing him, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host might feel responsible for the overall atmosphere and might not want others to be uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have had valid reasons for feeling isolated. Maybe they're shy, or there was a cultural difference in socializing. Also, the host's coworker (the guest's plus one) might feel that the host overreacted, especially if the guest was just being quiet. However, the guest did have the chance to engage but refused both the game and mingling suggestions. The host was within their rights to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the event and making others uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are whether the host acted unreasonably. The host did attempt multiple times to help the guest socialize. When those efforts failed, the host made a decision to maintain the party's environment. It's a subjective situation, but since the guest wasn't making an effort and the host tried to assist, the host might not be in the wrong. However, the tone of the guest's behavior and the host's reaction could affect this. If the host was abrupt or rude, maybe, but the description seems measured. So the answer is likely B.\n"
