I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story did the wrong thing by kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a friend of a coworker, came along. The host noticed he was standing alone and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after initial interactions. When the host suggested mingling or joining a game, he refused. Then the host told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend later criticized the host for this.\n\nSo, the host is asking if they were in the wrong. The user thinks the host isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility. The guest was invited as a plus one, which is a bit ambiguous. The host tried to include him, but he wasn't making an effort. The host might feel they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions, especially if the guest isn't trying. On the other hand, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if they're awkward.\n\nBut wait, the host did make efforts to help. They talked to him, introduced him, and made suggestions. The guest's refusal to engage beyond that might indicate he wasn't interested in participating. The host's party is their space, and they might have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the environment or if they're disruptive. However, the guest just standing alone isn't necessarily disruptive. Maybe the host was being overbearing?\n\nAnother angle: Was the host's action justified? If the party is supposed to be social, and the guest is not engaging despite being helped, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave. But maybe the guest was just shy or anxious. The host could have handled it differently, like offering more support or giving more time. However, the host did give multiple chances. \n\nAlso, the coworker friend thought it was \"shitty\" to tell him to leave. That's a strong reaction. Maybe the host should have considered that the guest's presence was important to their coworker. But the host explained their reasoning, and the coworker might have different expectations versus the host's responsibility to manage their own party.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to expect guests to make some effort to socialize. If someone is just standing around and not engaging, the host might feel they can't be held responsible for their discomfort. However, there's also an argument that hosting involves being inclusive, and kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as unkind.\n\nBut in this case, the host did try several times to help the guest integrate. The guest's refusal to participate after being given opportunities might mean the host isn't at fault. The line between being a good host and being responsible for every guest's experience is blurry. If the host is overwhelmed, they might prioritize their own comfort and the party's atmosphere.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the host isn't in the wrong. They made reasonable efforts to include the guest, and when those failed, they set a boundary. The guest's behavior was passive, not actively disruptive. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
