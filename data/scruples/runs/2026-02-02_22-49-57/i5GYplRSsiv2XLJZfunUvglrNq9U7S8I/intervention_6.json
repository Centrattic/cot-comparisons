I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but wasn't really a plus one. The host noticed the guest was awkward, tried talking to them, introduced them to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept standing alone. The host got annoyed because the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize and told them to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained they couldn't spend all their time helping the guest.\n\nI need to assess if the host was in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The host made an effort to help the guest integrate by talking to them and introducing them. The guest then ignored the introduction and refused to join in activities. The host, frustrated, asked them to leave. \n\nIs it fair to kick someone out for not socializing? Well, parties are social events. If someone is attending, they're expected to participate. However, some people are naturally shy. The host tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host had the right to set boundaries, especially if the guest was disruptive. \n\nThe coworker thought it was wrong, but the host had the right to manage their own party. The guest's behavior might have been passive-aggressive or attention-seeking. The host's actions were to maintain the party's social environment. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to assist and then set a boundary when the guest didn't make an effort. The guest's refusal to engage could be seen as a choice, not the host's fault. So the answer should be B.\n"
