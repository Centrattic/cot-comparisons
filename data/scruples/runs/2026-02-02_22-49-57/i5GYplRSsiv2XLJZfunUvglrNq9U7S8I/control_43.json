I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party because he wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one, but maybe he wasn't really expected. The guest was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. But the guest kept being alone again, even after the introduction. When the host suggested joining a game or mingling, he refused. Then the host told him to leave if he's just going to stand around. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host felt he wasn't making an effort.\n\nHmm. So the host did try to include the guest. The guest didn't take the initiative to socialize further. The host's responsibility is to manage the party, and if a guest is being uncooperative, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave. But is it the host's place to do that?\n\nOn one hand, the host provided opportunities for the guest to engage. The guest's refusal could be seen as his own choice. The host might have a right to set boundaries, especially if the guest is disruptive or not contributing to the social environment. On the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or anxious and needed more encouragement. The host could have tried harder, but the guest wasn't making an effort either. \n\nThe key points are: Did the host act unreasonably? The guest was given multiple chances. The host didn't kick him out immediately but after several attempts. The host's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort. Friends can be understanding, but the coworker friend was upset. However, the host's own perspective is that they didn't have time to drag him around. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong here. They tried to help, and when the guest didn't reciprocate, it's acceptable to ask him to leave. The guest's behavior was passive, and the host managed the situation as best as possible. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
