I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest, a plus one from a coworker, came along. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But when the guest was left alone again, he claimed no one was talking to him. The host tried suggesting games and mingling, but the guest refused both. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider social norms, expectations at parties, and what's reasonable. The host made efforts to include the guest, but after multiple attempts, the guest wasn't engaging. The host had a responsibility to manage the party, and if someone is not contributing or trying, it's reasonable to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the event. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained the situation. \n\nPossible arguments against the host: Maybe the guest had valid social anxiety, or the host should have been more patient. But the guest was given multiple chances and refused to participate. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely trying but struggling. However, the host did their part to help. The key is whether the host acted unreasonably. Considering all that, the host's actions seem justified. So the answer is B.\n"
