I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus-one. The host tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to others, but the guest kept standing alone and refused to engage in activities. The host then told him to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are the host's actions. They made an effort to include the guest, but when the guest didn't reciprocate, the host decided to ask him to leave. The host's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize and the host couldn't spend all their time facilitating interactions.\n\nFrom the host's perspective, they had a party to enjoy, and if a guest isn't participating and is causing discomfort, it might affect the overall atmosphere. However, some might argue that the host could have handled it more gracefully, maybe by giving the guest more time or finding another way to integrate him without confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or out of place, which is understandable. But expecting others to make all the effort to include him could be seen as unfair. The host isn't obligated to personally manage every guest's social interactions, especially if it's affecting the host's own experience.\n\nThe friend (coworker) of the guest thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning. The host's actions were direct, but not necessarily cruel. They addressed the issue when the guest wasn't responding to help. \n\nConsidering social norms, hosts can set boundaries to maintain the comfort of all guests. If someone is disrupting the party or not contributing to the social environment, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. The host did attempt to assist, but the guest's lack of effort justified the action in this context.\n\nSo, the host isn't in the wrong here. They tried to help, and when that failed, they enforced a boundary. It's a reasonable response to protect the party's dynamics. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
