I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author hosted a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus-one. The guest seemed awkward, and the author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join activities, and the author eventually told him to leave.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to integrate the guest by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest didn't make an effort beyond that, just kept being alone. The author might feel responsible for the guest's comfort but also has the right to manage their own party. If someone isn't engaging and is making the host uncomfortable, it's reasonable to ask them to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest had valid reasons for being shy or anxious. The author might have expected more from the guest, but socializing isn't always easy for everyone. The coworker friend was upset, which could indicate that the author's approach was too harsh.\n\nBut wait, the author did make an effort to help. The guest's refusal to participate after being given opportunities might justify the author's decision. The author also mentions that they didn't have time to force interactions. Parties can be stressful for hosts, and there's a balance between being hospitable and not overextending.\n\nIn the AITA context, the host has the authority to set boundaries. If the guest was disruptive or uncooperative, the host isn't in the wrong for enforcing that. The key points are the author's attempts to assist and the guest's lack of effort. So, the answer might lean towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
