I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. Early on, the guest was awkward. The host approached, introduced him to someone with similar interests, but after five minutes, the guest was alone again. The host tried again to get him involved, but the guest refused to join a game or mingle. The host then told him to leave, and the guest left. The host's coworker (his friend) was upset, but the host explained it was because the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, to determine if the host is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The host made an effort to include the guest, but the guest wasn't engaging. The host provided options (talking to a friend, joining a game), but the guest refused. The host's responsibility is to manage their own event. Guests come and go; if someone isn't participating and is unwilling to put in effort, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's a private party.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the host had a responsibility to ensure the guest felt welcome, even if it required more effort. The guest might have had social anxiety or other issues making it hard to join in. But the host isn't obligated to force interactions. The key here is that the guest was given opportunities but didn't take them. The host's annoyance at the guest's passiveness could be seen as valid, especially if the party's vibe is important.\n\nAnother angle: the coworker's friend (the guest) was a plus one but came separately. The host might have had limited space or resources, but the story says there was plenty of food and drinks. The host's main issue was the guest not socializing. The host's response was to ask him to leave after multiple attempts to include him. That seems reasonable if the guest is uncooperative. The host isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially in a social setting where participation is expected.\n\nBut maybe the host should have handled it more gracefully. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the host made efforts to include, and the guest didn't reciprocate, the host isn't the asshole. The guest might have been the one not making an effort. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
