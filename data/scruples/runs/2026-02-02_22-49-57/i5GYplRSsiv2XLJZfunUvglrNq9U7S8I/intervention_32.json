I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who hosted the party is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. After that, the guest was alone again. The host offered to join a game and suggested mingling, but the guest refused both times. Then the host told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained that the guest wasn't trying to socialize.\n\nNow, the question is whether the host was in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The host tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him. The guest, however, refused to engage further despite the opportunities provided. The host's party is their space, and they have the right to set boundaries. If a guest is making themself unwelcome by not participating and expecting others to accommodate them, the host might have a right to ask them to leave. On the flip side, maybe the guest was just shy or anxious and couldn't reach out to others. But the host did make an effort, and the guest didn't reciprocate. \n\nThe host's actions seem reasonable because they tried to include the guest, but when the guest didn't make any effort beyond being a passive participant, it's understandable that the host would feel they can't accommodate someone who's not contributing to the social environment. Parties are meant for interaction, and if someone is there but not engaging, it can disrupt the atmosphere. The host isn't obligated to force socialization on others or to act as a personal assistant to that guest. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the host could have handled it more gracefully, but the act of asking someone to leave for not participating isn't inherently wrong, especially if the guest was aware of the expectations. The host's explanation to the coworker about the guest not making an effort seems valid. So, in this case, the host probably isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
