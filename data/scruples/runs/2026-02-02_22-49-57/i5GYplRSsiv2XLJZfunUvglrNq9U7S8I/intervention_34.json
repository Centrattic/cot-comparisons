I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who hosted the party was wrong to kick out a guest for not socializing. The details are that the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed he was awkward, tried to help by introducing him to someone, but he kept being alone. The host got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They had a party with friends and coworkers, and they were trying to make sure everyone was having fun. The guest was there but not engaging, even after being helped. The host tried a couple of times to get him to interact, like suggesting a game. But he refused. So the host felt it was better for him to leave to not disrupt the rest of the evening.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been shy or just not comfortable. The host's coworker (his friend) brought him, and maybe he wasn't expecting a big social event. But the host had a right to manage their own party. It's their home, and if someone is being disruptive or not contributing in a way that's affecting the atmosphere, they might have the right to ask them to leave. However, did the host handle it appropriately?\n\nThe key points here are: the guest was not socializing despite being helped, the host gave multiple chances, and the host didn't seem hostile, just firm. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained the reasoning. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and gave opportunities to engage. The guest was choosing not to participate. The host can set boundaries for their own event. So the answer is B.\n"
