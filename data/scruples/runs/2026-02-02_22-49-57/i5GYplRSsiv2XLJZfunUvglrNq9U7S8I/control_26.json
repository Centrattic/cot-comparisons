I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me go through the details.\n\nThe party host noticed the guest was standing alone. They tried to help by asking if he was okay, talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and even suggesting he join a game. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the host's efforts. The host then got annoyed and told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the host made multiple attempts to integrate the guest, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host felt it was unfair to have someone who wasn't contributing to the social environment. Is the host wrong for setting that boundary?\n\nI think the host isn't at fault. Hosting a party requires managing the environment, and it's reasonable to ask someone to leave if they're not engaging and are using the event to feel sorry for themselves. The host did try to help, so it's not just a case of ignoring the guest. The guest's own actions led to the situation. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
