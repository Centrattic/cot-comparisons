I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing at their party.\n\nFirst, the context: The party had friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one of a coworker but came separately. The host noticed the guest was standing alone and tried interacting, introducing him to someone with similar interests. But after that, the guest kept being isolated. The host tried suggesting activities, but the guest refused. Eventually, the host told him to leave because they felt he wasn't making an effort. The coworker (the guest's plus one) thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nSo, the key points here are the host's actions and intentions. The host made initial efforts to include the guest. The guest, however, didn't reciprocate. The host felt responsible for the party's atmosphere and couldn't spend all their time managing one person's discomfort. \n\nIs the host in the wrong? Well, social norms often expect guests to make some effort to engage. If someone is clearly not trying to socialize, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. The host did attempt to help, but when those efforts failed, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The coworker's disapproval might be more about sensitivity to the guest's feelings, but the host's responsibility isn't to cater to every individual's needs indefinitely. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the guest had a valid reason for being shy or anxious. But the host can't be expected to read into that without more context. Also, the guest was at a social event; expecting some level of participation is fair. The host's decision to ask him to leave when he wasn't contributing or engaging isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to include the guest, and when that failed, they had the right to enforce party etiquette.\n"
