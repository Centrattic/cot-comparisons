I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author hosted a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a friend of a coworker, came along. The guest seemed to be standing around awkwardly. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but after a short conversation, the guest was alone again. The author made a couple more suggestions, like joining a game, but the guest refused. The author then told the guest to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend was upset about this, but the author felt the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The guest was a plus one but not explicitly invited by the host. The host made efforts to include him, but the guest didn't engage further. The author's frustration led to asking him to leave. \n\nOn one hand, as a host, you want everyone to feel welcome, but it's also a host's right to manage their event. If someone is not making an effort to socialize, maybe the host isn't obligated to force interactions. However, kicking someone out because they're awkward might come off as harsh. But the guest was given chances to interact and refused. \n\nThe author might argue that they tried to help, and the guest was being passive. The coworker friend's reaction was negative, but the author's reasoning is that they can't spend all their time facilitating the guest's social needs. It's a balance between hospitality and personal boundaries. \n\nIn similar situations, hosts often have the right to ask people to leave if they're causing issues or not respecting the event's vibe. The guest's behavior was passive-aggressive\u2014complaining about not being talked to when they weren't making an effort. The author's actions, while direct, might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and set a boundary when the guest didn't reciprocate effort.\n"
