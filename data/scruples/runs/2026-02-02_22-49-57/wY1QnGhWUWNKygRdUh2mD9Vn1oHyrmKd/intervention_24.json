I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, the author got a gift card and shared it on social media. Their sister found out and told the mom. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister and then even more for the cousins. The author felt this was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen. They decided to use the money on themselves and a friend, which upset the mom.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author is 15, which is a minor. The gift card was their own, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. The mom and sister might expect sharing, but the pressure from the mom escalated, making the author feel forced. The author's decision to keep the money and spend it on themselves could be seen as a reaction to the pressure. At 15, they might not be in a position to be expected to spend their own money on family unless it's a given expectation. However, cultural norms around gift-giving might play a role here.\n\nThe author's actions: they did initially intend to buy gifts but changed their mind due to the mom's pressure. The mom's reaction was harsh, leading to a conflict. The key points are ownership of the money (it's their gift card), the pressure from family, and the age of the author.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Arguably, no. They have the right to their own money. The mom's expectations might be unreasonable, and the author's response to the pressure is understandable. The fact that they were 15 also suggests they might not be in a position to be expected to handle such financial expectations. The pressure and the mom's behavior contributed to the author's decision. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
