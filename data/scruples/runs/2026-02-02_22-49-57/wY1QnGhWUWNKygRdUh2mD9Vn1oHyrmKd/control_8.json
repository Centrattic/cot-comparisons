I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is 15 years old, which is important because minors might have different expectations regarding responsibility and parental authority. They won a gift card and shared it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The mom then got involved and started adding more people to the list, making the situation frustrating for the author. The author decided to keep the money for themselves instead of buying gifts, leading to conflict with their mom.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (wrong) or B (not wrong). The key points here are the age of the individual, the context of the gift card being a windfall, the mother's demands after the child's initial agreement, and the author's decision to prioritize their own spending. \n\nMinors often don't have the same financial responsibilities as adults, and parents typically have more authority over their children's decisions, especially regarding money. However, the gift card was won by the child, so there's an argument that it's their money to spend as they wish. The mother's actions seem to add pressure, expecting the child to buy gifts for multiple relatives, which might be unreasonable given the child's age and the fact that some relatives aren't close. The child's decision to use the money for personal needs after feeling pressured could be seen as a reasonable boundary, especially if they're not in a position to spend that much. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might expect her child to consider family obligations, even if the child is young. The child's refusal could be seen as disrespecting family traditions or parental expectations, but given the circumstances and the age, it's more about the child asserting their autonomy. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not wrong) because the child is young, the money was their own, and the mother's demands were excessive. The child is within their rights to decide how to use their money, especially when the mother didn't have legal claim over it. The key here is the child's age and the context of the mother's pressure tactics.\n"
