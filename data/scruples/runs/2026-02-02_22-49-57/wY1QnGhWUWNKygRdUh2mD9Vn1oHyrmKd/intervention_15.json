I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after getting a gift card. The author is 15, which might be a factor.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 gift card and bragged about it. The sister found out, and the mom got involved, adding more people to the list. The author felt pressured and ended up spending the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset and tried to guilt-trip them.\n\nThe author's arguments are that the family was being greedy and overstepped by pressuring them. They also mention that the cousins are young and not seen often, so why spend on them. They felt justified in keeping their money after the family's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was being selfish, especially since they were given the gift card and expected to share. However, the author's age is a point\u201415 is still a minor, and their perspective on money management and expectations might differ. Also, the family's behavior in pressuring them could be seen as unreasonable. The author didn't have a legal obligation to buy gifts, so their choice to prioritize their own spending isn't inherently wrong. The main issue here is about expectations and boundaries. The author stood up for their decision, which could be seen as asserting their right to manage their own money, especially after feeling harassed. So, considering all that, the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
