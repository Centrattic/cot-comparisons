I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 15-year-old who got a $400 Target gift card and decided not to buy gifts for his family. The family members, especially his mom and sister, found out and started pressuring him to buy gifts for them and other relatives. He felt it was too much, especially since the two cousins are young and he doesn't see them often. He bought himself stuff instead, leading to a conflict with his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was 15, which is a teenager but still a minor. At that age, financial independence is limited, and family dynamics can be tricky. The gift card was a windfall he won, so it's his money. The key issue here is whether he was obligated to buy gifts for his family with his own money. \n\nHis mom and sister intervened after he told them not to tell their mom about the gift card. The mom then added more demands, which the author found unreasonable. He felt pressured and decided to use the money for himself instead. \n\nGift-giving is often a social expectation, especially during holidays. However, it's also a personal choice. The author might have felt the pressure was excessive, especially when his mom kept adding people to the list. The fact that the cousins are young and not frequently seen might make the expectation seem unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might expect that if you have a gift card, you should buy gifts for close relatives. The author's response of cutting off the gift-giving entirely could be seen as a rebellion, but given the pressure he was under, it's understandable. \n\nThe problem here is the communication breakdown. The author didn't want to spend the money as directed, and the family didn't respect his boundaries. The author's age might also play a role since teenagers might still be learning about financial responsibility and social expectations. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong because he was using his own money and felt the pressure was unreasonable. The family's demands were overstepping, especially after he was told not to share the gift card initially. His decision to prioritize his own spending is valid given the circumstances. However, the way he handled it (hanging up and ignoring calls) might be seen as rude, but the core issue is about the pressure he faced.\n"
