I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members after receiving a $400 gift card. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card and shared it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and called to ask about it, but the author told her not to tell their mom. However, the mom found out and insisted the author buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and maybe others. The author felt pressured and eventually decided to keep the money for themselves instead. The mom was upset and tried to guilt-trip the author.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is 15 years old. At that age, financial independence might be a new concept, and they might be learning to manage their own money. The mom and family members added pressure by demanding that the author spend the gift card money on others, which the author found obnoxious. The cousins are young, and the author might not have a close relationship with them. \n\nThe key points here are the pressure from the family and the author's right to their own money. While it's common in some families for gifts to be exchanged, especially during Christmas, the author might feel that the expectation was unreasonable, especially after the mom and sister acted greedily and obnoxiously. The author's decision to keep the money for personal use could be seen as standing up for their own financial autonomy, even if it's not the socially expected choice in their family.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, refusing to give gifts when the family expects it might be considered inconsiderate. But given the circumstances where the author felt pressured and the family members overstepped by demanding specific, thoughtful gifts for relatives they don't see often, the author's stance might be more about protecting their own money against unwanted demands.\n\nSince the author is a teenager, their perspective might be different from an adult's. They might be learning about money management and personal boundaries. The fact that they ended up buying gifts for a friend and themselves, and not the family, shows they allocated the money as they saw fit, which is their prerogative with their own funds.\n\nIn summary, while there's a cultural expectation to exchange gifts, the author's experience involved pressure and demands that crossed into greediness. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to comply with those expectations, especially when it's their own money and they weren't obligated to spend it that way.\n"
