I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for their family using a gift card they received. The key points here are the author's age, the context of the gift card, and the family's reactions.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old. At that age, financial responsibility is still developing, and they might not have a steady income. The gift card was won, not earned, so they have a choice over how to spend it. The author initially agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister but then the mom added the cousins, which the author found unreasonable. The cousins are young and the author doesn't see them often, so the request seems excessive. \n\nThe mom's behavior is a big factor here. She got the gift card without the author's consent after the author specifically told the sister not to tell her. Then she pressured the author further by adding more people and being \"obnoxious\" in her tone. The author felt frustrated with the mom's greed and lack of respect for their money. \n\nThe author decided to use the gift card for themselves and a friend, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. They stood their ground against family pressure, which might be seen as self-assertion. The mom's reaction was a result of the author's decision, but the author didn't back down from their stance. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They had the right to decide how to use their money, especially after being pressured inappropriately. The mom overstepped by accessing the gift card and expanding the list without the author's agreement. The author's age and financial situation support the argument that they weren't in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
