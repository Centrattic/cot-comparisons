I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the person refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 Target gift card. They got a gift card through a drawing, posted about it on Instagram, and their sister saw it. The sister told the mom, and the mom then kept adding more people to the list. The author decided not to buy gifts for their mom, sister, and cousins, instead spending the money on themselves. The mom was upset and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 15 years old, which is a teenager. At that age, they might be learning about independence and financial responsibility. They received the gift card themselves through a contest, so they might feel it's their money to spend as they wish. They were pressured by their mom to buy gifts for multiple family members, which the author found excessive, especially since the cousins are young and not frequently seen. The author's response was to not buy gifts and spend on themselves, leading to a conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might be expecting family traditions of exchanging gifts. The mom's initial reaction was to take the gift card and direct the purchase, which the author found obnoxious. The mom's behavior might have been overstepping, making the author feel that their autonomy was being invaded. The pressure to buy more gifts could have been the trigger for the author's decision.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy over personal finances, family expectations, and the appropriateness of the mom's behavior. The author did not have to spend the money on family if they didn't want to, especially if it's their own money. However, refusing to buy gifts might be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate in some family contexts. But given the mom's pushiness and the author's justification (conservative spending, sudden added demands), the author's stance could be justified.\n\nThe age factor is important. At 15, the author is still under parental care, but they are becoming more independent. The mom's approach might have been heavy-handed, leading the author to push back. The author's decision to use the money for personal needs and interests is understandable if they felt the pressure was unreasonable. The mom's guilt-tripping after the fact complicates the situation, as it shows she expected compliance without respecting the author's financial boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the author's age, the mom's pressure, and the author's right to manage their own money, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, there's a cultural aspect where gift-giving is a tradition, so some might argue the author should have considered family expectations. But given the context of how the situation unfolded, the author's choice seems reasonable. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
