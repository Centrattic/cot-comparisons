I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The author initially agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister, but then the mom added the cousins, which the author found unreasonable. The author ended up keeping the gift card for themselves and got gifts for a buddy and themselves. The family was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is a teenager. They received a gift card they didn't ask for, and their sister and mom found out. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for extended family, including young cousins they don't see often. The author felt this was unfair and didn't want to spend their money on people they don't interact with. \n\nThe author's argument is that the family was greedy and overstepped by pressuring them. The mom's behavior, like bursting into the room and making demands, seems intrusive. The author also mentions they are very conservative with money, so spending on others without being asked might be a big stretch for them.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if the pressure was obnoxious, the author could have handled it differently. For example, maybe negotiating the budget or setting boundaries before making the purchases. However, the author felt that the requests were unreasonable, especially adding cousins they don't see often. The fact that the author used the money for self-gifting and a friend, which they had the right to do as it was their gift, could also be seen as justified.\n\nThe key points here are the family's pressure, the author's financial responsibility, and the age of the author. At 15, they might be learning about personal money management and boundaries. The mom's behavior might have contributed to the author's decision to stop the spending. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to decide how to use their own money, especially after feeling pressured. The mom and family might have overstepped by making demands, and the author's reaction, while maybe a bit abrupt, is understandable given the context. The answer is more likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
