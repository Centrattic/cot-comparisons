I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is 15, so that's a factor. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family after receiving a $400 gift card. The key points are:\n\n1. The author won the gift card, mentioned it on Instagram (where their sister follows), leading their mom to find out. The sister called to ask about it, and the author told her not to tell the mom. Then the mom came in and demanded they use the card for the author's sister and themselves. Then, when the author was at Target, the mom added cousins to the list, which the author thought was unnecessary, especially since the cousins are young and not seen often. The author then decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user's argument is that the author isn't wrong. Let's break down the factors. \n\nFirst, the author is a minor, so there might be expectations from parents about how they handle money, especially if it's a family member's gift card? Wait, no, the gift card was won by the author, so technically it's their own money. Parents might still have expectations about sharing or being generous, but the author is 15, and financial independence is a topic here. \n\nThe mom's behavior seems a bit overbearing. The author was told not to tell the mom, but the mom found out through the sister. The mom then took the gift card and told the author they had to buy gifts for family members. The mom even added cousins without prior communication. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not buying gifts? Well, in many cultures, family gift-giving is a tradition. However, the author was given no prior indication that this was expected unless they won something. The fact that the mom only brought it up after the author had the gift card might be the issue. The author might feel that the expectation was only because they suddenly had money. The mom's approach seems to have been more about using the author's money rather than a genuine expectation.\n\nThe author's decision to spend on themselves could be seen as selfish, but considering the mom's behavior\u2014being \"obnoxious\" and adding more people without discussion\u2014it's possible the author felt manipulated. The age of 15 also plays a role; they might be developing their own views on money and personal autonomy.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be justified if the mom was pressuring them to use their own money for others without prior discussion. The key here is whether the author had an obligation to buy gifts. If it's a family tradition, maybe there's an expectation, but the suddenness and the way the mom handled it (especially adding cousins without notice) might have crossed a line.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong. Considering the context, the author's decision was a reaction to the mom's pressure and the lack of prior expectations. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
