I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for their family members after winning a gift card. So, first, I need to understand the situation step by step.\n\nThe author won a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, where their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and the author told the sister not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, came to their room, and told them they had to get gifts for her and the sister. The author agreed but was already conservative with money. Then the mom called again asking for gifts for the cousins, which the author found ridiculous because the cousins are young and not seen often. The author refused, spent the gift card on themselves, and got into an argument with the mom.\n\nThe author is 15, so maybe that's a factor. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the gift card was won by the author. So technically, it's their money to spend as they wish. The mom and sister didn't give them the gift card; they just found out about it. The author tried to keep it private, but the mom insisted on getting gifts. The author felt pressured and then decided not to spend the money on family, which led to conflict.\n\nIs there an expectation in the family to buy gifts for each other? If the mom is pressuring the author to spend their own money, that might be unreasonable. The author is a teenager with limited financial experience, so maybe they're trying to manage their money responsibly. The cousins being 6 and 2\u2014buying gifts for them isn't necessary if the author doesn't see them often. The author also bought a gift for a friend and themselves, which shows they're not completely selfish.\n\nBut on the flip side, maybe the family has traditions or expectations that the author is ignoring. The mom's reaction could be seen as overstepping by trying to control the author's money. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they felt coerced into spending.\n\nAge might play a role here. At 15, the author is learning financial independence and setting boundaries. The mom's approach might be too demanding, not considering the author's perspective. The author's decision to keep their assets private in the future suggests they want autonomy, which is a normal part of growing up.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to their money and the right to set limits, especially if family expectations were unreasonable. The mom's actions might be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
