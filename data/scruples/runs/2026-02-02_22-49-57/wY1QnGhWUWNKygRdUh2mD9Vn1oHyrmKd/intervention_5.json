I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying gifts for their family members after someone gave them a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the context: The author, who is 15, received a gift card and shared it on Instagram. Their sister saw it, and the mom found out. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister and cousins. The author felt it was excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often, and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. The mom got angry and tried to guilt-trip them.\n\nSo, the key points here are about money management and family expectations. The author is being asked if they did wrong by not giving gifts. \n\nThe author is 15, so they're a minor and might not have much financial independence. They were pressured by their mom to spend the gift card on others, which they found obnoxious. The gift card was a windfall, not their own money, but they still have the right to decide how to use it. \n\nFrom a young person's perspective, especially someone who's conservative with money, the pressure to spend on family members they don't see often could be frustrating. The mom's reaction was to be \"obnoxious\" and push for more gifts, which led the author to cut the gifts entirely. \n\nThe author's argument is that the family members (mom and sister) were greedy and meddled with their money. They also mention buying gifts for a friend and themselves, which is their choice. The mom's reaction was harsh, leading to an argument. \n\nConsidering that the gift card was not the author's own money, they have a right to use it as they wish. However, there might be cultural or family expectations around gift-giving during holidays. But the author's age and their personal financial habits (being conservative) could justify their decision. \n\nThe mom's behavior of pressuring the author to spend on others they don't frequently interact with might be seen as excessive. The author's reaction of spending on themselves could be seen as a reasonable response to the pressure. \n\nIn terms of \"right or wrong,\" it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author wasn't legally obligated to buy gifts and the mom's actions were pushy, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their age and the context of being a minor might also factor in, as they're learning financial independence. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to their own money and reacted to family pressure. The mom's actions were more obnoxious, and the author's decision to prioritize their own needs after being pressured is understandable.\n"
