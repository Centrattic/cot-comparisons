I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram where their sister saw it. The sister called asking about it, and the user told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, came into their room, and insisted they buy gifts for the sister and themselves. Then, while the user was at Target, the mom added two more cousins to the list, emphasizing to be thoughtful and not cheap. The user then refused to get the gifts, bought stuff for themselves and a friend, and got into an argument with the mom. The user now is being scolded by the mom for not getting gifts for the family.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The user is 15, which is a teenager, so their perspective on money and independence might be different. The gift card was a personal win, and they were hesitant to share it. The mom ended up getting involved without the user's consent, adding more people to the gift list. The user felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to share gifts with family, especially during Christmas. However, the user had not initially planned to buy gifts for everyone and felt the mom was being greedy by increasing the list. The cousins are young and the user doesn't see them often, so spending a lot on them might not make sense. The user also explicitly told the sister not to tell the mom, but the mom still found out, which could have led to the user feeling that their privacy was invaded.\n\nThe user's actions of refusing to buy the gifts after the mom's demands could be seen as a stand for personal financial boundaries, especially since the user is conservative with money. However, from the family's perspective, the user might be seen as being selfish or disrespectful by not giving gifts they expected. \n\nBut considering the mom overstepped by getting the gift card and adding cousins to the list without the user's consent, the user's frustration is understandable. The user was coerced into spending money on people they didn't necessarily want to spend on, and the situation escalated to the point where the user decided to use the gift card for their own needs. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the user had an obligation to buy the gifts. If there was a prior agreement or expectation, then the user might be in the wrong. But in this case, the user had not agreed to give gifts to everyone initially. The mom added more people after the initial request. The user's refusal could be seen as a reasonable response to being pressured beyond their initial intent. \n\nGiven the user's age and their conservative nature with money, it's possible that they were not in the wrong. The mom's actions of invading the user's privacy and expanding the gift list without consent might be the main issues here. Therefore, the answer might be B (the user is not in the wrong).\n"
