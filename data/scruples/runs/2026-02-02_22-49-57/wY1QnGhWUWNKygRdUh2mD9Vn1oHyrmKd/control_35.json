I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, the author got a gift card and told their sister not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway. The mom then pushed the author to buy gifts for the sister, the author's mom, and even two cousins who are very young. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. They got some stuff like AirPods, games, and a cheap laptop. The mom was upset and guilt-tripped the author, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not buying family gifts. Let's break it down. The author is 15 years old, which might mean they're still learning about money management and family expectations. The mom might expect that receiving a gift card means sharing or buying gifts for others, but the author feels it's their own money now. However, in many families, there's an unspoken rule that if you win something, you might be expected to share or buy gifts for family members, especially if it's a large amount like $400. \n\nBut the mom's approach seems a bit overbearing. She went into the author's room after being told not to tell, and then added more people (the cousins) to the list. The author felt pressured and decided to take control of their money. The mom's guilt-tripping and the way she handled the situation could be part of the problem. The author's reaction might be a result of feeling that their autonomy over the money was respected if they didn't want to share it.\n\nOn the other hand, in some cultures or families, it's customary to share such windfalls, especially if family members are expecting it. The author might have set unrealistic expectations by bragging about the gift card online, which could lead to others expecting gifts. But the mom's behavior of pushing for more gifts after the initial request might have crossed a line. The author's decision to stop buying gifts after the mom's demands could be seen as a justified stand against excessive pressure.\n\nConsidering the age, the author is still a minor, so their mom might feel responsible for guiding their spending, but the author's right to their own money is also important. The key points are the mom's overstepping by revealing the gift card without permission, adding more people, and the author's reaction to the pressure. It's a bit of a grey area. However, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own needs and resisting undue pressure from their mom. The mom might have handled it differently, but the author's actions are a response to the mom's behavior. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
