I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Christmas gifts and money. The author is 15 years old, which is a teenager. They won a $400 Target gift card and posted about it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and told their mom, which the author didn't want. Then the mom got the gift card and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the whole family, including cousins. The author decided not to buy anything for the family and spent the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset and gave them a hard time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They mention being very conservative with money, so maybe they didn't want to spend it. The mom and sister started pressuring them, especially after finding out about the gift card. The author felt that the pressure was too much, so they decided to keep the money for themselves. They also mention that the cousins are young and they don't see them often, so maybe the mom's demand for thoughtful gifts was unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might think that since the gift card was received, it's expected to share it with family. But the author didn't technically receive the gift card as a gift; they won it. So they might not feel obligated to share it. The mom's reaction could be seen as greedy or overstepping, especially if she took the gift card from the author and then demanded more gifts. The author's decision to spend the money on themselves and a friend, not the family, might be justified if the mom was pressuring them inappropriately.\n\nAge is a factor here. At 15, the author might not have a lot of financial independence, but they have their own money now. The mom's behavior of taking the gift card and dictating its use could be seen as controlling. The author's frustration with the mom's greed and wanting to keep their assets private makes sense in that context.\n\nSo considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. They were pressured by their family, felt the demands were unreasonable, and decided to use their money as they saw fit. The mom's actions were more inconsiderate and maybe greedy, leading to the author's decision. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
