I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation involves the author winning a $400 Target gift card, sharing it on Instagram, and then family members (mom and sister) reacting by pressuring them to buy gifts for multiple people. The author ends up spending the money on themselves instead and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is pretty young. At that age, financial independence is still developing, and they might be learning about money management. The gift card was a windfall, so they weren't expecting to have that extra. The mom and sister, upon finding out, added pressure to buy gifts, which the author found obnoxious. The author felt that their personal money was being encroached upon by the family members.\n\nThe key points here are the pressure from the family and the author's right to manage their own money. The author didn't want to spend on cousins they don't see often and felt the initial request was excessive. The mom's actions of taking the gift card and adding more people to the list might have been seen as greedy by the author. The author's response was to use the money for themselves, which is their right, especially since it was a personal gift card they had earned, even if it was found through a drawing.\n\nHowever, from a family perspective, especially with a parent, there's an expectation of contributing to family traditions, which might include gift-giving. But the parent's approach here seems to be overstepping by not respecting the child's financial boundaries and adding unexpected people to the list. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they value their money and wanted to use it for their own needs.\n\nThe author's age is a factor. At 15, they might not have a lot of financial experience, and being pressured in this way could be stressful. The mom's reaction to the refusal could be seen as harsh, but the author's decision to set boundaries is also valid. The question is whether the author was wrong for not buying gifts. Since the money was the author's to spend as they saw fit, and the pressure from family members was excessive, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their own spending, especially when it's a personal gift card they obtained themselves. The conflict arose from miscommunication and differing expectations, but the author's actions were within their rights.\n"
