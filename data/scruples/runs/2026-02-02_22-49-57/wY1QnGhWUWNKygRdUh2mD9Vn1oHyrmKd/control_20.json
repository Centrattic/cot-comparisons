I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old who won a $400 Target gift card. They shared it on Instagram, and their sister followed up with a call, asking who gave it. The user told the sister not to tell their mom, but the mom found out anyway. Then, the mom insisted they buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and possibly others. The user felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead, leading to conflict with the mom.\n\nFirst, the age is a factor. At 15, the person is still a minor, so family expectations might be different compared to an adult. However, the situation involves personal money (a gift card they won), which is their own. The mom and sister acted in a way that breached the user's privacy by telling each other about the gift card. The mom then added unexpected recipients (cousins) after the initial request for gifts, which the user found unreasonable, especially considering the cousins are young and not part of their regular family interactions.\n\nThe user's decision to use the money for themselves could be seen as self-preservation, especially since they mentioned being very conservative with money. The mom's actions\u2014like bursting into their room and pressuring them to buy gifts\u2014might have crossed boundaries. The user's frustration stems from feeling that their privacy was invaded and their money was being controlled by family members. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the user could have handled the situation differently, like setting boundaries before spending the money. But given the circumstances of being a minor and the added pressure from family, it's understandable why they might feel entitled to their own money. The mom's reaction was harsh, and the user's response was a form of standing up for themselves, which isn't necessarily wrong. So, considering the context, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
