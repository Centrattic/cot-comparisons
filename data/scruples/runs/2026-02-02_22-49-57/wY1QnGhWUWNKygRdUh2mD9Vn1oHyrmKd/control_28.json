I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly.\n\nThe author is 15 years old. They received a $400 Target gift card they won in a drawing. They posted about it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister then called the author and asked about the gift card. The author specifically told the sister not to tell their mom, but the mom found out anyway. The mom then insisted the author buy gifts for her and the sister. Then, when the author was shopping, the mom called again, adding two cousins (ages 6 and 2), making it even more expensive. The author refused, bought themselves stuff instead, and got into an argument with their mom. The author justifies this by saying the mom was greedy, and they were being pushed into spending their money.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author is a minor, 15 years old. Their parents might have some expectations, especially around Christmas, but the author is handling their own money. The gift card was a personal prize, so they have the right to use it as they wish. However, in some families, there's an unspoken expectation that if you receive something, you might share it with family, especially when it's mentioned publicly.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems problematic. She didn't ask the author's permission to add more people to the list after the initial request. The author tried to set boundaries but was overruled. The mom's insistence on using the gift card for others when the author wanted to use it for themselves might be a conflict of expectations. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they felt pressured to spend on people they don't see often, like cousins 6 and 2.\n\nBut then, the author did initially agree to buy gifts for mom and sister, then changed their mind after the mom added more people. The author's decision to buy themselves stuff instead could be seen as a way to reclaim control after feeling coerced. However, the author could have communicated better. Instead of hanging up, they could have explained their limits more clearly. But the mom's behavior was also overstepping by adding expenses without consent.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to manage their own money, especially if it's a personal gift. The mom's actions were greedy and controlling, which the author is justified in resisting. The author's age might mean they have less experience, but their decision to set boundaries is valid. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
