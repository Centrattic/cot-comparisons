I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 gift card, which they won. They initially intended to use some of it for family gifts but then decided not to after their mom and sister started pressuring them.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old, which is a key point. At that age, financial independence is still developing, and they might not have a lot of money. The gift card was unexpected, so they might feel it's their own to use as they see fit. The mom and sister's reactions\u2014especially the mom adding more people to the list without consulting\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author felt pressured and decided to stop buying gifts for family, which led to conflict.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, in many families, especially in Western cultures, giving gifts during Christmas is a tradition. However, the pressure here seems excessive. The mom's behavior of bursting into the room and making demands might have been too much. The author using the money on personal items and a friend's gift could be seen as their right if they earned or received the money themselves. However, some might argue that once you mention having money, especially in a family context, there's an expectation to share, but that's subjective.\n\nThe key factors are the author's age, the unexpected pressure from family members, and the fact that the money was a gift card they didn't have to use for gifts. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and a friend's gift instead of family could be seen as reasonable, especially if they felt coerced. But others might say that family expectations are important and the author should have considered their family's feelings.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the context of the pressure and the age. The author isn't wrong for standing up for their financial independence and not feeling obligated to share under such circumstances. So the answer is B (No).\n"
