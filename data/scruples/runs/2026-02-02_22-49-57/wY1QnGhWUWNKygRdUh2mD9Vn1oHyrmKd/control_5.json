I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author got a gift card, told their sister about it, and then their mom found out. The mom and sister then started pressuring the author to buy gifts for them and extended family, including cousins. The author felt this pressure was obnoxious, especially since they're 15, not used to having a lot of money, and wanted to spend the gift card on themselves. They ended up not buying gifts and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author is a teenager, which is a key point. At 15, they're still learning about money management and personal boundaries. The mom might see it as a responsibility to share the gift card with family, especially during a holiday. However, the mom's approach\u2014bursting into the room, the obnoxious comments, and the pressure\u2014could have felt very controlling or greedy to the author. The fact that the author had to work up the nerve to say no after being pressured by both the sister and mom suggests that the pressure was significant. \n\nAlso, the cousins are young (6 and 2), so the expectation to buy thoughtful, non-cheap gifts for them might be unreasonable. The author might feel that this is an unnecessary expense, especially if they don't see these cousins often. The mom's reaction, including guilt-tripping and an argument, indicates that communication was a problem.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural expectations and family norms. In some families, sharing gifts or treating family members during Christmas is a given. However, the author is using their own money (even if it's a gift card) and has the right to decide how to spend it. The mom's overreaction and the pressure might have crossed a line, leading the author to feel justified in their decision.\n\nBut there's also the argument that Christmas is a time for giving, and the author might be seen as selfish for not sharing. However, considering the circumstances\u2014being a teenager, the pressure from family, and the mom's behavior\u2014it's a grey area. The key points are the mom's overstepping and the author's right to their own money. \n\nSo, taking into account the age, the pressure tactics, and the unreasonableness of the expectations (especially for young cousins), it's more about the mom's approach being wrong. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
