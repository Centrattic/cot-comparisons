I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after winning a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the context: The author, a 15-year-old, won a gift card and shared it on social media. His sister found out and told their mom, which he tried to prevent. The mom then gave him a hard time about using the gift card for family, adding more people (cousins) even though they don't see them often. The author felt pressured, changed his mind, and spent the money on himself instead. The mom was upset and tried to guilt-trip him.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and pressure. The author didn't want to share his won gift card, especially after the mom kept adding more people. The pressure from the mom and sister to use the gift card for others, despite the author's discomfort, might justify his decision to keep the money. Also, the cousins are young and not seen often, so the expectation to spend on them could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nThe author's age is 15, which is a teenager who might be learning about personal boundaries and financial responsibility. The mom's actions in pressuring him and adding more people without considering his feelings or the context could be seen as overstepping. The author's response, while maybe abrupt (hanging up, ignoring calls), was a reaction to the pressure. He did try to buy gifts initially but was overwhelmed by the added expectations.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his right to use his own money (even if it's a gift card he won) without undue pressure. The family's behavior was pushy and perhaps greedy, leading to his decision. The answer should be B.\n"
