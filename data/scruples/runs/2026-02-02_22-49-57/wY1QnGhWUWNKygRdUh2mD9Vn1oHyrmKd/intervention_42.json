I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying Christmas gifts for their family. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 gift card, which they initially intended to use for themselves but their mom and sister wanted them to get gifts for the family. The author then decided not to buy gifts and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is pretty young. They won a gift card and were specific about not wanting their mom to know. However, the mom found out and started adding more people to the gift list. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their own money versus family expectations. The mom's behavior seems overbearing, especially after the author had already expressed not wanting others to know about the gift card. The mom then demanded gifts for more people, which the author found unreasonable, especially considering the cousins are young and not frequently seen. \n\nThe author's decision to use the money for personal needs and a friend might be justified given the pressure they faced. The mom's reaction of guilt-tripping and yelling could indicate a lack of respect for the author's autonomy. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have handled the situation differently, perhaps by setting boundaries earlier or communicating their intentions more clearly. But given the mom's continued demands and the author's age, it's understandable that they felt frustrated and chose to assert control over their own money.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. The mom's behavior was manipulative, and the author had the right to decide how to spend their own money, especially after the family overstepped by pressuring them. The author's response was a reaction to being pushed, not just a refusal to give gifts. So the answer should be B.\n"
