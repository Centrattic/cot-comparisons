I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 15-year-old who received a $400 Target gift card, and their family members (mom and sister) found out. The mom then insists they buy gifts for the sister, the mom, and even two cousins. The person ends up using the gift card for themselves instead and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the person is wrong. Let's break it down. The person was given a gift card they won, which is their own money. They initially intended to buy gifts for their family but the mom kept expanding the list without their consent. The person felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility angle, the person is managing their own money. The mom's behavior seems to be overstepping by not respecting the person's autonomy in how to spend the gift card. The mom's insistence on buying gifts for more people, especially cousins they don't see often, could be seen as greedy, as the person mentioned.\n\nHowever, the person did initially consider buying gifts for their mom and sister, which shows some intention to be generous. The mom's actions of bursting into their room and pressuring them might have been a trigger for the person's decision to stop buying gifts. The person's age (15) might mean they're still learning about financial independence and family dynamics, but they have a right to their own money.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and respect for personal finances. The family members didn't ask for the gift card, and the mom's behavior seems to take without permission. The person's frustration is justified because their money was being controlled by others. The argument with the mom might have been harsh, but the underlying issue is about respecting the person's ownership of the gift card.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong because they have the right to decide how to use their own money, even if it means not spending it on others. The mom's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
