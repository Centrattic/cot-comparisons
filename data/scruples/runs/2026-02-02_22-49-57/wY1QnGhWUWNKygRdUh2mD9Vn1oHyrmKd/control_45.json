I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a 15-year-old who won a $400 gift card and ended up not buying gifts for family members after feeling pressured by their mom and sister.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author initially intended to use the gift card for themselves but ended up deciding to buy gifts for family. However, the mom and sister kept adding more people, which frustrated the author. The mom's tone was obnoxious, and the author felt they were being greedy. The author then changed their mind, bought themselves stuff, and got into an argument with the mom.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author, 15 is a minor, and family dynamics might involve different expectations. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are ownership of the gift card, the pressure from family, and the decision to not buy gifts.\n\nThe gift card was won by the author, so they have ownership. The family members might expect that winning a gift card would be an opportunity to buy gifts, but the author felt pressured. The mom's demands and the sister's actions (like informing the mom) likely contributed to the author's frustration. \n\nHowever, in many cultures, there's an expectation to share, especially during holidays. But the author's response was to prioritize their own needs after feeling pressured. The argument arises because the mom didn't respect the author's decision to stop buying gifts. \n\nBut the author did initially agree to buy gifts for mom and sister, then the mom added more people. The author felt it was unnecessary, especially for cousins they don't see often. The author then changed their mind. \n\nIs it wrong to not buy gifts for family? It depends on cultural norms and family expectations. The author is a teenager, and their reaction might be influenced by their personality and the pressure they faced. The mom's approach was likely too demanding, which led the author to rebel.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to their own money. The mom and sister's behavior might have been more at fault here. The author made a choice to protect their own resources after being pushed. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (author not in the wrong).\n"
