I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 gift card and then family members pressuring them to buy gifts for the entire family, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author won the gift card and initially told their sister not to tell their mom. However, the mom found out anyway. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for multiple family members, including cousins. The author felt uncomfortable with the pressure, especially since they're 15 and probably not used to handling large sums of money. They decided to spend the money on themselves and a friend instead, leading to an argument with their mom.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author was a minor, which is important because their financial responsibility and understanding might be limited. The mom's actions\u2014pressuring the child to spend the money on others, especially after the gift card was initially a personal gain\u2014might be seen as overstepping. The author's frustration is understandable given the sudden pressure and lack of prior expectation to buy gifts for extended family. The mom's behavior of \"giving an ass chewing\" and guilt-tripping could be seen as contributing to the conflict.\n\nHowever, in many cultures, there's an expectation of giving gifts during holidays, and the author might have been expected to share the windfall with family. But considering the author's age and the fact that they were given a windfall without prior obligation, the pressure from the mother could be excessive. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending isn't inherently wrong, especially if there was no prior agreement to use the gift card for family gifts.\n\nSo, the key points are the age of the author, the unannounced pressure from the mother, and the lack of prior expectation. The author's actions might be justified as a response to being taken advantage of. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
