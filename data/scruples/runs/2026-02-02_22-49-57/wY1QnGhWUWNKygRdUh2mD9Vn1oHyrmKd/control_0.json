I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is 15 and got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and they begged her not to tell their mom. But then the mom found out anyway and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the family, including the sister, mom, and even two cousins. The author felt it was too much, especially since the cousins are young and not seen often. They decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and family expectations. In many families, exchanging gifts during Christmas is a tradition. However, the author was 15 and might not have a lot of money. The gift card was a windfall, but the mom and sister's reactions might have been over the top. The mom pressured them to buy for more people than initially expected, including cousins. The author felt it was unfair, especially since they have limited interactions with the cousins. The fact that the mom kept adding people after the initial request could be a point of contention.\n\nAlso, the author's explanation that they're very conservative with money is important. They might feel that the money is their own, even if it's a gift card, and have the right to spend it as they see fit. The mom's reaction might have been aggressive, leading the author to push back. Since the author is a minor, there might be some expectations from the parents about sharing, but at 15, they're still developing autonomy. However, family dynamics vary, and some might expect children to share gifts, especially with immediate family.\n\nAnother angle is the mom's behavior. She found out about the gift card without permission (the sister told her, despite the author's request not to) and then started pressuring the author. The mom's insistence on buying for cousins might have crossed a line, making the author feel that their personal finances were being invaded. The author's response was to buy themselves things instead, which could be seen as standing up for their own financial autonomy.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author does have a responsibility in a family context. Even if they're 15, refusing to buy any gifts for family might be seen as selfish, especially if others expected it. However, the key here is the pressure applied by the mom and sister. If the author felt coerced into buying more than they were comfortable with, their refusal could be justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't legally in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts, but socially or within family norms, it's a gray area. The mom's approach might have been heavy-handed, which led to the author's reaction. So, considering the mom's overstepping and the author's reasonable financial conservatism, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might be standing up for their own boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure.\n"
