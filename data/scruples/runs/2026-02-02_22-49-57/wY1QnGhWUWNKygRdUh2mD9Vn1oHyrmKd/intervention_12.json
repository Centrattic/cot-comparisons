I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The story is about a 15-year-old who won a $400 gift card. They initially planned to use it for themselves but were pressured by their family to buy gifts for others. The person ended up not getting gifts for their family and got into an argument with their mom. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a teenager, 15 years old, which is important. At that age, financial independence is still developing, and they might be learning about money management. The gift card was a windfall, and they were clear about not wanting to share it after family members were pushy.\n\nThe mother and sister found out about the gift card, and the mom added more people to the list (cousins) after the initial pressure. The author felt it was unreasonable to spend on cousins they don't see often. The key points here are the sudden increase in gift recipients and the pressure from family members.\n\nThe author decided to use the money for themselves, which is their right, especially since the gift card was a personal win. The family's reaction was a shock, but the author stood their ground. The argument that the author is not in the wrong could focus on the fact that the money is their own, and the family's demands were excessive and unexpected, especially for relatives they don't interact with much.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have considered family expectations, especially since the initial idea was to buy gifts for mom and sister. However, the author was pressured further by the mom to include cousins, which might have pushed them to the limit. The author also mentions being very conservative with money, so the idea of spending on multiple people without prior commitment could be too much.\n\nThe fact that the author was 15 is a factor. At that age, handling large sums and family dynamics can be overwhelming. They might not have the same financial responsibilities as an adult, so their decision to prioritize their own needs after the pressure makes sense.\n\nIn terms of whether it's right or wrong, the key is ownership of the gift card. Since it was a personal prize, the author isn't obligated to share unless they choose to. The family's pushiness might have crossed a line, leading to the author's justified frustration. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had the right to decide how to use their own money, especially after being pressured inappropriately.\n"
