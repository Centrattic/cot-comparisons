I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the 15-year-old is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts after someone else got a gift card. \n\nFirst, the kid got a $400 Target gift card. He bragged about it on Instagram, which his sister saw. She called him, and he told her not to tell mom. But mom found out anyway. She then insisted he buy gifts for his sister and himself. Then mom added more people, the cousins. The kid felt pressured and decided to keep the money, buying himself stuff instead. Mom was upset, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the age of the person involved, 15 years old, their perspective and maturity level might be different. They might not have a full grasp of social expectations yet. The family's reaction seems to have escalated the situation\u2014mom and sister getting involved without respecting his initial boundaries. The kid's frustration stems from feeling that his privacy and money were invaded. He ended up spending the money on himself after being pressured, which led to conflict.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a debate. On one hand, family traditions and expectations might involve giving gifts. On the other, the kid was pressured to spend money he had earned (even if it was a gift card) without being forced to. The family's insistence on adding more people, especially for young cousins he doesn't see often, could be seen as excessive. The kid's decision to prioritize his own needs after feeling pushed around might be justified. Also, considering he's a minor, financial independence isn't expected, but his reaction is partly due to feeling coerced.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. However, the key points are the family's pressure and the kid's response to that pressure. Since he's 15, his actions might be more about standing up for his money rather than selfishness. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
