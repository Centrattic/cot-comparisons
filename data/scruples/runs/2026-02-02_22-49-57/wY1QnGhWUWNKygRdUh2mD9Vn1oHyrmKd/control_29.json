I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is 15 years old. They won a $400 Target gift card and posted about it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and called to ask about it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. However, the mom found out anyway and started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the author's sister, then later for the cousins. The author then decided not to buy any gifts for the family and instead spent the money on themselves and a friend. The mom got upset and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's age. At 15, they're a minor, and family dynamics can be tricky. The author had the money, which they won, so legally they can spend it as they wish. But culturally, there's an expectation to share with family, especially during Christmas. However, the mom and sister overstepped by pressuring and being greedy, according to the author.\n\nThe author felt the pressure was inappropriate, especially since they didn't see the cousins often. Their decision to not buy gifts and spend on themselves might be seen as selfish by some, but others might support their right to use their money without coercion. The argument escalated because of the mom's reaction, which could have been handled differently.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did explicitly say no to buying gifts after the pressure, but they had the right to their money. The main issue is the family's reaction and the pressure. The author isn't necessarily wrong for protecting their money from unwanted interference. However, refusing to give gifts might be seen as rude in some contexts, but the context here includes the family being overbearing.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer is likely B (No), because the author had the right to their money and the family's pressure was unreasonable. The author's actions were a response to that pressure, not just selfishness.\n"
