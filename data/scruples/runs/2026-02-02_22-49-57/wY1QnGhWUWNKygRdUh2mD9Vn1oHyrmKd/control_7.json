I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family after receiving a $400 gift card. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author received a gift card and bragged about it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and called them, but the author specifically told her not to tell their mom. However, the mom still found out and insisted on using the gift card to buy presents for the author's sister and then added more people (cousins). The author felt pressured and decided not to buy anything, spending the money on themselves instead. This led to an argument with their mom.\n\nNow, considering the author is 15 years old, their perspective and financial maturity might be different. They mention being very conservative with money, which is understandable. The key points here are the pressure from the mother and the family's reaction after the author made their decision.\n\nThe author wasn't obligated to buy gifts for family members, especially since the gift card was a personal prize. The mother's insistence and the added pressure (like calling it \"greedy\" if they didn't share) might have been unreasonable. The author's decision to keep the money and not comply with the sudden gift demands could be seen as a stand against unwanted pressure, even if it caused family conflict.\n\nHowever, the author did initially agree to buy gifts for their mom and sister before the mother added more people. But when the mother extended it to cousins, the author felt it was unnecessary, especially considering the cousins are young and not often seen. The author's frustration with the mother's greed and pressure is a significant factor here.\n\nAge is a factor. At 15, the author might be learning about financial independence and personal boundaries. The mother's reaction, including guilt-tripping and yelling, doesn't help. The situation seems more about the mother's expectations and control over the gift card rather than the author's selfishness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to decide how to spend their money, especially after feeling pressured. The mother's behavior was more problematic in this scenario.\n"
