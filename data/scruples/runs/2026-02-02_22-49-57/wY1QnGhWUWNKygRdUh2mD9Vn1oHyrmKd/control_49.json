I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old who won a $400 Target gift card. The family found out, and the author was pressured to buy gifts for multiple relatives, which they refused. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong for not buying the gifts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a minor, 15 years old, which is a key factor. At that age, many people are still learning about financial independence and personal boundaries. The gift card was a result of a drawing, so it's their own money. The family members, especially the mom and sister, overheard or found out about the gift card and started pressuring the author to buy gifts for them. The author felt that the pressure was excessive and decided to spend the money on themselves instead.\n\nThe author mentions that the mom and sister were \"obnoxious\" in their demands, adding more relatives (cousins) to the list. The author found this unreasonable, especially since they don't see the cousins often. The final argument led to a confrontation where the author stood their ground.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, not buying gifts for family during Christmas might be seen as inconsiderate. But the author was under pressure and felt that their privacy was invaded. The family members didn't ask politely; instead, they demanded and even violated the author's request not to tell the mom, leading to a loss of control over their own money. The author used the money for personal needs and a friend, which makes sense as they are still young and might need those items themselves.\n\nThe key points here are the pressure tactics from the family, the invasion of privacy, and the author's decision to prioritize their own needs. While refusing to buy gifts can be seen as selfish, the circumstances where the author felt pressured and the family's overreach might justify their actions. Also, considering the age, financial maturity, and the fact that the gift card was their own money, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The situation shows a conflict between family expectations and personal boundaries, where the author is asserting their independence.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the pressure from the family was inappropriate, and the author had the right to use their money as they saw fit, especially after being pushed into obligations they didn't agree with.\n"
