I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is 15 years old, which I should consider because they're a minor and might not have a lot of financial independence yet. They won a $400 Target gift card and shared it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But then the mom found out anyway and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the family members, including the sister, cousins, and maybe others.\n\nThe author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves instead, buying things like AirPods, a laptop, etc. The mom was upset and gave them a lecture. The author stood their ground, saying that if the mom had kept off their money, they would have bought gifts. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's think about the points. First, the author didn't have to use their own money for gifts. They were given the gift card, but the mom and family members pressured them to use it for gifts. The author might feel that their money (even though it's a gift card they won) is their own to spend as they please. However, in some family dynamics, there's an expectation to share or buy gifts, especially around Christmas. But the author is a minor, so their financial independence is limited, but they might still have autonomy over their own earnings.\n\nThe mom's approach seems a bit overbearing. She got the gift card from the author's sister without permission and then dictated how it should be used. The author's response of refusing could be seen as standing up for their own financial decisions, especially if they feel the pressure is unwarranted. The fact that the cousins are young and the author doesn't see them often might justify not spending on them. The author also mentions being very conservative with money, so spending on others against their will could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to buy any gifts for family members might be seen as inconsiderate, especially during a family event like Christmas. However, the author's main issue seems to be the pressure and lack of privacy. The mom's actions of getting the gift card without permission and then dictating its use might have crossed a line. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and budget, especially after being pressured, could be justified. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to decide how to use their money, especially after the family overstepped by accessing their gift card and pressuring them. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
