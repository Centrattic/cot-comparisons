I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old who received a $400 gift card, and their family members pressured them to buy gifts for everyone. The author ended up not giving gifts to their family and instead spoiled themselves, leading to a conflict with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they are very conservative with money, so spending $400 on themselves after being pressured might be a reaction to the pressure. The family members, especially the mom, seem to have taken the gift card as an opportunity to demand gifts. The author initially agreed to buy gifts for mom and sister, but then the mom added cousins. The author felt it was unnecessary, especially since the cousins are young and not seen often. They decided to stop and use the money for themselves instead. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, refusing to buy gifts for family during Christmas could be seen as selfish, especially if there's an expectation to share. However, the family's behavior might have contributed to the author's decision. The mom's insistence and the pressure could have made the author resentful. The author also mentions that the mom took the gift card without permission after the sister found out, which might have led to the author feeling their privacy was invaded. \n\nThe age of the author (15) is a factor. At that age, they might be learning about personal boundaries and financial responsibility. The mom's actions in pressuring them and taking the gift card could be overstepping. The author's response, while possibly harsh, might be a reaction to feeling that their money is being controlled. \n\nHowever, Christmas is a time for giving, and even if there's pressure, completely cutting off gifts might be seen as not participating in family traditions. But the key here is the family's behavior towards the author's money. The author felt forced to share, which could be unreasonable. \n\nSo, considering the pressure from the mom and the way the situation was handled, the author's decision might be justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the family's actions contributed to the conflict. But some might argue that the author should have handled it with more grace. However, the main issue is the family's overstepping, so the author isn't necessarily wrong."
