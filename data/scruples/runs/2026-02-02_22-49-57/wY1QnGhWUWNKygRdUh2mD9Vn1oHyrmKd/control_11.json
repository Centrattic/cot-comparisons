I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 15-year-old who received a $400 gift card, shared it on social media, and then faced pressure from their family to buy gifts for multiple relatives. The author decided not to buy any gifts after feeling pressured and instead spent the money on themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both the author and the family. The author mentions being very conservative with money, which is a valid point. The family, especially the mother, seemed to push for spending on gifts after finding out about the gift card. The author felt that the family was being greedy and that the pressure to spend was unreasonable, especially for cousins they don't see often. \n\nThe mother's reaction\u2014insisting on buying for more people and being upset when the author didn't comply\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author had the right to decide how to use their own money, even if it's a gift. However, in some family dynamics, there might be unspoken expectations about sharing gifts, especially during holidays. The fact that the mother and sister intervened without the author's consent (like the mom taking the gift card) might contribute to the author's frustration.\n\nAge is a factor here too. At 15, the author might still be learning about financial independence and personal boundaries. The mother's guilt-tripping and the family's pressure could be counterproductive. While there's an expectation in some cultures to give gifts during Christmas, the amount and the insistence on specific relatives might be excessive. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and set boundaries isn't necessarily wrong, especially if they felt coerced.\n\nOn the other hand, not giving any gifts might be seen as selfish by the family's standards. But considering the pressure applied, the author's actions could be justified as a stand against being manipulated. The key here is whether the author was obligated to give gifts against their will. Since the money was their own and they were pressured into it, their choice to not comply might be reasonable. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
