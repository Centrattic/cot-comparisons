I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author got the gift card and shared it on Instagram. The sister found out, called the author, and the author specifically told her not to tell the mom. But the mom still found out and started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the sister and then additional cousins. The author felt this was too much, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen. The author then decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to a confrontation with the mom.\n\nThe key points here are the author's age (15), the pressure from the family, and the author's decision to use the money as they saw fit. At 15, the author is a minor, so they might not have full financial independence. However, the gift card was a personal win, which they had the right to use as they wished. The mom's reaction was pushing for more than the initial family members, which the author found unreasonable, especially considering the age of the cousins and the frequency of interaction.\n\nThe author's frustration stems from the mom and sister's reaction. They felt the pressure was excessive and that their money was being \"taken\" from them. The argument about privacy and future assets suggests the author wants to maintain control over their finances. The mom's guilt-tripping after the author stood their ground might have exacerbated the situation.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author was given a gift card, and while it's their money, there's often an expectation in families to share during holidays. However, the author was pressured beyond the initial request, adding more people (cousins) at the last minute, which could be seen as taking advantage. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and not feel obligated to spend on people they don't see often could be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have handled the situation better. Telling the mom directly that they wouldn't buy gifts instead of ignoring calls and then getting into an argument might have been more respectful. But given the context of the mom's pushiness and the author's age, there's a case to be made that the author wasn't in the wrong for asserting their right to manage their own money, especially after being pressured inappropriately.\n"
