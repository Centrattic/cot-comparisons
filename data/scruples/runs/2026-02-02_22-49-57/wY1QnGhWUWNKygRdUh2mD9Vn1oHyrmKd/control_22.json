I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for family members with a gift card they received. The author is 15 years old, which is important context.\n\nFirst, the author won a $400 gift card and shared it on Instagram. The sister found out and told the mom, even though the author asked her not to. The mom then insisted the author buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and maybe others. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead, leading to conflict with the mom.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the arguments for both sides. \n\nOn one hand, family traditions and expectations might play a role. Parents often set expectations for gift-giving, especially during holidays. The mom might see it as the author's responsibility to give gifts, especially since they have the means. The author might feel that the mom overstepped by pressuring them, especially given the age and financial maturity of the author. However, at 15, the author might still be under their parent's care, so there could be an expectation of following family norms.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a right to their money, even if it's a gift. The mom's reaction could be seen as greedy or pressuring the child inappropriately. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending, especially after the mom's insistence, could be a reasonable response to perceived overreach. Also, the situation with the cousins being young and not close might make the author feel it's unnecessary to spend on them.\n\nConsidering the age, 15-year-olds are still developing their financial independence. However, they might have some autonomy. The key issue here is the pressure from the family and how the author responded. The act of refusing to give gifts could be seen as selfish, but if the pressure was unreasonable, the author might have a valid point.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the mom's demands were excessive, especially given the circumstances. The author had the right to decide how to use their gift card, and the mom's reaction was inappropriate. So, the answer would be B.\n"
