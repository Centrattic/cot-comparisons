I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation involves the author getting a $400 gift card, which their sister found out about. The mother then insisted they buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and others. The author refused, spent the money on themselves and a friend, and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. There's nothing illegal here; the author is using their own money. The gift card was a prize they won, so they have the right to use it as they see fit. Legally, they're not obligated to buy gifts for anyone unless there's a prior agreement, which there doesn't seem to be.\n\nNext, the social or familial aspect. The author is 15 years old, so their perspective and maturity level matter. The mother's demands might be seen as pushy, especially adding more people (the 6 and 2-year-old cousins) after the initial request. The author felt pressured and decided not to comply, which is their choice. However, in some cultures or families, expecting certain gift-giving norms is common. But the mother's reaction was harsh, and the author's response was defending their decision, which is understandable.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014spending on themselves and a friend\u2014are within their rights. The mother's behavior of pressuring and then yelling might be seen as aggressive. The key issue is the pressure applied by the family, which led the author to refuse. The author's statement about keeping future assets private might indicate a loss of trust, which is a result of the situation, not necessarily a fault of the author.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a choice based on their own financial priorities and the way they were treated. The family's expectations and the mother's handling of the situation contributed to the conflict. So the answer should be B.\n"
