I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the 15-year-old is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 gift card. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the kid got the gift card through a drawing and posted about it. His sister saw it and told the mom, even though he asked her not to. The mom then demanded that he use the gift card for his sister and mom. Then the mom added more people, the cousins, even though they're young and not part of the immediate family. The kid didn't want to spend money on them, especially after the mom was pushy. He ended up buying himself stuff and other friends, which upset the mom.\n\nSo, the key points here: the kid is 15, which is a minor, and the money is his. The mom's behavior seems to be pressuring him to give up his money. The kid's reaction was to stop buying gifts entirely, which led to conflict. \n\nIs the kid in the wrong? Well, in terms of money, he's allowed to spend it as he wants. The mom's expectation that he must share might be seen as controlling. The kid's age might influence how we view responsibility\u201415 is still a teenager, so expectations might be different. However, maybe there's an unspoken expectation in families to give gifts. But the mom added more people after he already agreed, which could be seen as taking advantage. The kid's frustration with the mom's greed is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he should have stood his ground earlier or communicated better. But given the mom's behavior, the kid's decision to protect his money and not comply with the added demands seems reasonable. The fact that the cousins are young and not seen often supports the kid's point about not needing to spend on them. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the kid isn't in the wrong. The mom overstepped by pressuring him and adding more people after the initial request. The kid's right to manage his own money is key here. Answer B.\n"
