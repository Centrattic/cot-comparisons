I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 15-year-old who won a $400 Target gift card and ended up not buying gifts for their family members after their mom and sister pressured them. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The kid got a gift card, shared it on social media where their sister saw. Sister called to ask, and the kid told her not to tell mom. But the mom found out anyway, got the gift card, and then started requesting gifts for the family. The mom added more people (cousins) after the initial request. The kid then decided not to buy gifts and used the money for themselves. The mom got upset and yelled, and the kid defended themselves by saying the mom was greedy and shouldn't have meddled with their money.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate whether the author is at fault here. \n\nFactors to consider: The gift card was the kid's own money, right? They won it themselves. So, they own it. The mom's behavior here seems pressuring, especially adding more people after the initial request. The kid is 15, so maybe they're not in a position to be expected to spend that amount of money on family. The mom's actions of bursting into the room and being obnoxious could contribute to the kid changing their mind. \n\nAlso, the kid had already agreed to buy gifts for mom and sister but then the mom added cousins. The kid might feel it's unfair to spend on cousins they don't see often. The mom's pressure tactics might be the main issue here. The kid's decision to use the money for themselves isn't wrong if the money is theirs. The mom overstepped by pressuring and meddled in the kid's finances. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their own money and the mom's behavior was inappropriate. Therefore, answer B.\n"
