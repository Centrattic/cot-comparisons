I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not buying Christmas gifts for family after receiving a gift card. The user is 15, which might be a factor.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card. They told their sister, who then told their mom. The author didn't want the mom to know, but the mom found out and told them they had to buy gifts for the sister and other family members. Then the mom added more people, the cousins, and the author decided not to buy anything, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and responsibilities. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, it's common to give gifts to family during Christmas, but it's not a strict rule. The author is a teenager, so their perspective might be different from adults' expectations. \n\nThe author mentions being very conservative with money. They had the gift card, but after the mom and sister acted \"obnoxiously\" about using it for others, they decided to keep the money for themselves. The mom then got upset because she expected gifts. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the family members were being greedy and pushing their way into their money. The mom's behavior\u2014like bursting into the room and pressuring\u2014might be seen as overstepping. The author felt their privacy was invaded when the sister told the mom, and then the mom added more people without the author's consent. The author's response was to not buy gifts and instead spend on themselves, which is a valid choice if they don't feel obligated.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once a gift card is received, especially in a family setting, there's an expectation to reciprocate. But the author wasn't obligated to use the gift card for gifts. It's their own money, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. The problem arose when the family members pressured them into using it for others, which the author found annoying and inconsiderate.\n\nThe age of the author is 15, so they might not have a job or significant income. The family might expect them to contribute to gift-giving, but the author's response was to set boundaries. The mom's reaction could be seen as harsh, especially after the author clearly stated their refusal.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to decide how to spend their own money. The family's pressure and the mom's actions might be more at fault here. The author standing up for their financial independence, especially at a young age, could be seen as a positive development. So the answer is B.\n"
