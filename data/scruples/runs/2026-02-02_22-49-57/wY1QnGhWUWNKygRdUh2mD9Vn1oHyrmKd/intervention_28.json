I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving Christmas gifts to their family. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They told their sister on Instagram, and then their mom found out. The mom and sister started asking for gifts, and the mom even added more people (the cousins) later. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead. They ended up not giving any gifts to family, which upset their mom, leading to an argument.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the pressure from the family, the age of the author, and the sudden expansion of gift recipients. The author is very conservative with money, which they mention, so maybe they felt it was unfair to be forced to spend on people they don't see often, like the cousins.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems a bit controlling, especially when she took the gift card and then added the cousins unexpectedly. The author might have felt disrespected, leading them to decide against giving gifts. The response from the mom being an \"ass chewing\" doesn't help either. \n\nConsidering the age of the author (15), they might not have a fully developed sense of financial responsibility yet, but they also have the right to manage their own money. The family's expectation of using the gift card for others without prior discussion could be seen as greedy, as the author mentioned. \n\nThe author's decision to keep the money for themselves after being pressured might be justified, especially if there was no prior agreement. The mom's reaction and the way she intervened could have been a factor in the author's decision. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They were given a windfall and chose how to use it, especially after being pressured by family members. The family's demands might have crossed a line, prompting the author to protect their own resources. The answer is likely B.\n"
