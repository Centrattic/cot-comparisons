I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is 15 and refused to buy gifts for family members after someone else found out about their gift card. The key points here are about personal responsibility, family expectations, and age.\n\nFirst, the gift card was given to the author, so they own it. The author didn't have to share it, especially since they're a minor but managing their own money. The mom and sister started pressuring them after the gift card was discovered. The author felt that the family was being greedy and overstepped by demanding gifts for multiple people, including cousins they don't see often. The author then decided to spend the money on themselves instead.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the family members were being inconsiderate by pressuring them financially. The mom even made demands after the initial call. The author's decision to stop giving gifts could be seen as standing up for their own financial boundaries. However, some might argue that they should have considered family expectations, especially around Christmas. But given the age of the author and the fact that the money wasn't given with the expectation of redistribution, it's more about personal choice.\n\nThe cousins are young, so maybe the author isn't obligated to spend on them. The author also mentions that they have a buddy who received a gift, which shows they weren't entirely selfish. The mom's reaction was a surprise because she expected the author to keep giving despite the pressure. The author's frustration with the family's greed is a valid response to being pressured for money they won.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't legally obligated to share the gift card. Emotionally, they felt disrespected by the family's demands. Since the author is 15, their perspective might be more about asserting independence. The family's expectations might be high, but the author has the right to decide how to spend their money, especially if it's their own. The key issue is the pressure from family members leading to the author's decision. The answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
