I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts. The situation is that the author received a $400 gift card and initially planned to buy gifts for mom and sister. But then mom added cousins into the mix, leading the author to change their mind. The author is 15, so maybe that affects things.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they didn't buy gifts for family after feeling pressured. The mom and sister added more people, which the author found unreasonable, especially since the cousins are young and not close. The author used the money for themselves and a friend, which they felt was justified given the pressure.\n\nNow, the key points here. Gift-giving during the holidays is often cultural and varies by family. Some families have strict expectations, others don't. The author was pressured by their mom after already being given the gift card info. The mom might feel entitled to gifts once she knew about the money, but the author sees it as being greedy.\n\nThe author is 15, which might mean they're still learning about family dynamics and financial responsibility. At that age, asserting independence is common. The mom's reaction could be harsh, but as a parent, she might have expected her child to give gifts, especially since she added more people. However, the author's reasoning (cousins are young, not close, pressure from mom) could be seen as valid.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did make a choice not to give gifts, which might upset family. But they were pressured by their mom, and the mom might have set unreasonable expectations. The author's decision to keep the money for themselves could be seen as selfish, but also as standing up to pressure. The age factor might make the situation more complex, as teenagers often test boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't legally obligated to give gifts, but socially or within family norms, there might be expectations. The mom's behavior (bursts into the room, calls, texts) also contributed to the author's frustration. The author's response (ignoring calls, buying for themselves) is a form of asserting control, which could be seen as justified given the pressure.\n\nSo, considering all factors, it's not straightforward. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were pressured, and the mom's expectations might have been excessive. Their age also plays a role in their perspective. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
