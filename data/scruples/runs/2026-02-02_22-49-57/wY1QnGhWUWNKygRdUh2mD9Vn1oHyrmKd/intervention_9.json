I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 Target gift card and then refusing to buy gifts for family members after they pressured him to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the story. The author is 15 years old, which might affect how we judge the situation. He won the gift card and shared it on Instagram, which his sister saw. His mom then pressured him to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and possibly others. The author felt this pressure was excessive and decided to spend the money on himself instead. His mom was upset, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author's defense is that he's being conservative with his money, and the family members were overbearing. He also mentions the cousins are young and he doesn't see them often, so he didn't see the need to spend on them. The mom's reaction included guilt-tripping and being obnoxious, which made him change his mind.\n\nNow, considering the options: A is the author is wrong, B is not. I need to evaluate if his actions were justified. From a personal finance perspective, he earned/obtained the money himself, so he has the right to spend it as he wishes. However, in some cultures or families, there's an expectation that gifts are given to family members, especially during holidays. His refusal might be seen as inconsiderate or selfish by some.\n\nBut the pressure from his family played a role here. The mom and sister overstepped by pressuring him to spend the money, especially after he initially intended to buy gifts. The fact that he was 15 years old is a factor\u2014teenagers might have different views on money management and family expectations. The author's main issue was the pressure and the feeling that his money was being controlled by others. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while there's an expectation to give gifts, the family's behavior (yelling, guilt-tripping) is problematic. The author's decision to walk away from the pressure and spend the money on himself could be seen as standing up for his personal financial autonomy. However, some might argue that he should have been more considerate of family traditions and expectations, even if they were pushy.\n\nOn balance, the author's actions seem justified given the pressure he faced. He's a teenager learning to manage his money, and the family's reaction was excessive. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). However, there's a cultural or familial aspect to consider where expectations might differ. But given the specific circumstances of the pressure and the author's age, B makes sense.\n"
