I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a 15-year-old who got a $400 gift card and decided not to buy gifts for family members after their mom kept adding more people. The author feels frustrated because the mom and sister started pressuring them, and they ended up keeping the money for themselves instead. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was given the gift card, which they won. They had the right to use it as they wanted. Their mom and sister started pressuring them to buy gifts for more relatives, which the author found unreasonable, especially for cousins they don't see often. The author then decided to spend the money on themselves and a friend, leading to a conflict with the mother.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, in many cultures, it's customary to give gifts during Christmas, especially to family members. The author might have felt a social obligation, but they were pressured by their mom. However, the gift card was their own money, and they have the right to spend it as they see fit. The author's frustration seems justified given the pressure and the sudden expansion of gift recipients. Also, they're only 15, which might affect their perspective on financial independence and family expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might have expected the gift card to be used for family gifts, especially since the author initially agreed to get gifts for their mom and sister. But the mom then added more people, which the author found excessive. The key points here are the initial pressure, the sudden increase in gift recipients, and the author's right to manage their own money. \n\nConsidering these factors, the author's decision to prioritize their own spending after the pressure they faced seems reasonable. They're maintaining their financial autonomy and expressing their discomfort with being pressured. The mother's reaction is also a part of the conflict, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing their ground. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
