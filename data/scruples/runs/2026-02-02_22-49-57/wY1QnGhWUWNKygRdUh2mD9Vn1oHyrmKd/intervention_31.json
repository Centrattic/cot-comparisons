I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts after winning a gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card and initially planned to buy gifts for mom and sister. But then mom added two more cousins, which the author found unreasonable. The cousins are young, 6 and 2, and the author doesn't see them often. The author felt pressured into spending money they were saving, which led to frustration. They decided to use the gift card for themselves instead.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the author is 15 and very conservative with money. They might not have a lot of disposable income, so being forced to spend it on others could be stressful. The family's reaction\u2014mom being \"obnoxious\" and adding unexpected people\u2014probably made the author feel like their money wasn't their own. \n\nThe author's decision to not buy gifts might seem selfish at first, but considering the context of being pressured and the lack of a close relationship with the cousins, it's understandable. Also, they did buy a friend a gift and treated themselves, which shows they were still generous in some way.\n\nHowever, some might argue that not giving gifts to family, especially after a relative got the gift card, could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author's reasoning is that the family was being greedy and overstepping by adding more people. The argument here is about personal boundaries and financial autonomy versus family expectations.\n\nIn terms of right vs wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had the right to decide how to use their own money, even if it means not buying gifts for everyone. The family's behavior in pressuring them might have contributed to the author's decision. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
