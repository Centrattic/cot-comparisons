I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members. The author is 15, which might be a factor. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 gift card. They told their sister but told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway. The mom then insisted the author buy gifts for the sister, the author's cousins (who are 6 and 2), and maybe others. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead. They got some personal items and a gift for a friend, but nothing for family. The mom was upset and started yelling, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is a minor, so their financial independence is limited. The mom might feel entitled to some of that money if she's managing the household or if there's shared resources. But the gift card was a personal win. The author didn't want to spend it on family gifts because they felt it was their own money. The mom overstepped by insisting and being obnoxious, maybe even violating the author's privacy by getting the gift card after being told not to. The author's reaction was to stop giving gifts and spend on themselves, which led to conflict.\n\nThe age of the author is 15. At that age, they might still be under their parents' care, so the mom might have certain expectations. However, the pressure and lack of respect for the author's personal space and money could be the root issue here. The mom's behavior was controlling and maybe even guilt-tripping, which isn't healthy. The author had the right to decide how to use their own money, especially if they're being raised to be responsible and conservative with it. The fact that the cousins are young and not frequently seen might make the author's reluctance more understandable. \n\nAlso, the mom's reaction was harsh, leading to an argument. The author stood up for themselves, which is a positive trait. So considering all that, the author's actions are justified. They're not wrong for wanting to manage their own money and setting boundaries. The mom's behavior is more at fault here for being overbearing. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
