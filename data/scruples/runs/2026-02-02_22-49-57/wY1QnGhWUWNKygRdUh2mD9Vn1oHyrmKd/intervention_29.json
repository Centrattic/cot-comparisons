I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts. The person is 15 years old, which probably matters because minors have different expectations and responsibilities compared to adults. \n\nThe context says that the author won a $400 Target gift card, mentioned it on Instagram, and his sister saw it. Then the mom found out and pressured him to buy gifts for multiple family members, including the sister and cousins who are young. The author decided not to buy gifts after feeling pressured and used the money for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age here. At 15, the person is a teenager, not a legal adult. Their financial independence is limited, and they might not be expected to contribute financially to family gifts. The mom's behavior seems to be taking advantage of the situation, using the gift card as an opportunity to get gifts for others. The pressure from the mom and sister is a key point here. The author felt that their privacy and personal money were invaded when the mom took the gift card. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author was obligated to share the gift card proceeds with family. Since the gift card was a personal win, the author had the right to use it as they saw fit. The family members, especially the mom, overstepped by pressuring the teenager to spend on others without any prior expectation.\n\nAlso, the cousins are very young, so it's questionable why they needed expensive gifts. The author's decision to use the money for personal needs and a friend is reasonable, especially considering their conservative approach to money. The mom's reaction being an \"ass chewing\" is another point against her, showing poor handling of the situation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common to exchange gifts during Christmas, the pressure here was excessive. The author's right to control their own money, even as a minor, is important. The fact that the gift card was a personal prize strengthens the argument that it's their money to spend as they choose. The mom's interference and lack of respect for the teenager's wishes contribute to the author's justified decision.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had the right to use their own money, the family overstepped with their demands, and the author's age reduces any expectation of financial responsibility in this context.\n"
