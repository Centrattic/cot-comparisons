I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is 15, got a $400 gift card, and then their family found out and started pressuring them to buy gifts for everyone. The author decided not to buy gifts and instead spent the money on themselves and a friend. The mom was upset and it caused an argument.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're very conservative with money. So maybe they felt the pressure to spend wasn't justified. The family members they're being asked to buy for are cousins who are 6 and 2, and not close. That seems like maybe the mom was extending the obligation too far. The author also had a friend get a gift, so maybe they did consider giving but chose someone they actually wanted to. \n\nThe problem here is about expectations. Did the author owe it to their family to buy gifts? In many cultures, giving gifts during Christmas is a tradition, but it's not a legal obligation. The author's family might have expected it because of the gift card being a windfall, but the author might feel it's their money to do with as they please. The mom's reaction seems to be more about the pressure and maybe not respecting the author's autonomy. \n\nThe author was 15, so maybe they're not in a position to handle large sums of money and the expectations that come with it. The mom might have overstepped by pressuring them, especially after being told not to share the gift card info. The sister told the mom, which broke the author's trust, leading to more pressure. \n\nIs the author wrong for refusing? It depends on the context. If the family expected gifts and the author had already agreed before the pressure from the mom and sister, then not following through could be seen as a breach. But since the mom added more people (the cousins) after the initial agreement, maybe the author felt it was too much. Also, the author's explanation about not seeing the cousins often could justify not spending much on them. \n\nThe key points are the pressure from family, the breach of trust (sister telling mom), the mom's obnoxiousness, and the author's right to spend their own money. The author's reaction might be about standing up for their own boundaries, which is understandable. However, the argument is that they didn't buy gifts for family, which might be seen as rude in some contexts. But given the circumstances, the pressure from family and the age of the relatives, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were under pressure, the family's expectations were excessive, and they made their own decision despite that. The mom's behavior seems to have contributed to the conflict.\n"
