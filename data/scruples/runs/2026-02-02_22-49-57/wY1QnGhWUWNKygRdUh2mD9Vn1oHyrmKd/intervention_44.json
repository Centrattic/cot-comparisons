I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teenager is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members using a $400 gift card they won.\n\nFirst, the context: the teen got a gift card and told their sister not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, took the gift card, and then started demanding that the teen buy gifts for multiple family members. The teen, who's very conservative with money, ended up using the gift card for themselves instead, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, from the teen's perspective, they didn't owe it to their family to spend their own money, especially when the mom and aunt/sister didn't respect their privacy about the gift card. The mom's insistence on using the gift card for others might have felt manipulative or greedy to the teen. The teen's reaction\u2014buying themselves stuff and standing their ground\u2014seems like a way to assert control over their own finances.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the teen was being selfish by not buying gifts for family, especially since the mom had already taken the gift card. But considering the age (15) and their personality (very conservative with money), it's understandable that they felt pressured and decided to keep the money. The mom's actions in revealing the gift card and then pressuring them might be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's initial overreach by taking the gift card and adding the cousins to the list, which increased the pressure. The teen's decision to not comply and set boundaries could be seen as justified, especially since they were using their own money. The conflict arose from the mom's actions, not the teen's initial refusal. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
