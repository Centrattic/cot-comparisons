I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author spending a gift card they won without being pressured to do so for family gifts, but then refusing to buy gifts after their mom and sister started pressuring them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author received a $400 gift card, which they had to keep secret from their mom. The mom found out, then added more people for gifts. The author felt it was unfair, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen. They decided to spend the money on themselves and a friend instead. The mom got upset and argued, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but they want my take. So I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective is that they were being pressured to spend money on family when they didn't feel obligated, especially since the gift was unexpected. The mom's side is that there's an expectation to give gifts during Christmas, which the author ignored, causing disappointment.\n\nLegally, the gift card is the author's to spend as they wish. They aren't legally obligated to buy gifts for others. However, from a social standpoint, gift-giving is a common tradition, so not participating can be seen as rude. But the author was pressured after revealing the gift card, which might have influenced their decision.\n\nThe author is 15, which is a teenager with growing independence. Their stance is about personal financial decisions and boundaries. The mom's reaction suggests she expected the gift card to be used for the family, possibly seeing it as a chance to get gifts without the author having to spend their own money. The author's frustration is valid because the money wasn't theirs to give, and the pressure felt greedy.\n\nConsidering these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a choice to spend the money on themselves after feeling pressured. The mom's approach was controlling, and the author's response was standing up for their own boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
