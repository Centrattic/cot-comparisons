I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is 15 years old and had a $400 Target gift card. They didn't want to buy gifts for family members because their mom and sister pressured them, especially after they found out about the gift card. The author ended up buying themselves stuff instead and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author. At 15, they might not have a lot of financial independence yet. The gift card was a windfall they won, so they might see it as their own money. The family pressured them to buy gifts for multiple people, including cousins they don't see often. The author felt it was unfair, especially since they were being asked to spend money on people they don't interact with much.\n\nThe mom's reaction was to be \"obnoxious\" and pressure the kid, which made the author resentful. The author stood up for their decision, which could be seen as asserting their own financial autonomy. But from a family perspective, expecting gifts for family members during Christmas is common in some cultures. However, the author isn't in a position to spend that much, and the pressure from the parents might be unreasonable.\n\nFinancial responsibility is important, but so is respecting the wishes of a minor. The mother might feel that the author should share, but the author has the right to decide how to use their own money. The problem here is the pressure tactics used by the parents, which led to conflict. The author's decision to not buy gifts despite the pressure isn't necessarily wrong, especially considering their age and the circumstances. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting their own money from what they perceive as greed, and their age plays a role in their perspective.\n"
