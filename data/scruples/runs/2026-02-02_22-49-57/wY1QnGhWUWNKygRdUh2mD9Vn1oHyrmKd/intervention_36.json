I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 15-year-old who received a $400 gift card, got pressured by family to buy gifts for everyone, and then decided not to buy anything for them, which led to conflict with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author received a gift card and shared it on Instagram. The sister found out, then the mom got involved, adding more people to the list. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves after getting annoyed by the demands. The mom was upset when the author didn't buy gifts.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is a minor, 15 years old, and the gift card was received through a drawing. The family members, especially the mother, might feel entitled to gifts since the author got money. However, the author was pressured and felt the requests were excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often. The author also gave a gift to a friend, which might indicate they're willing to give, but not to family under pressure.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as reasonable if they felt coerced. The mom might have overstepped by adding more people without considering the author's financial comfort. The author's decision to use the money for personal needs and a friend could be justified if they felt the family was being greedy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have considered family expectations, especially during Christmas. The mother might have expected gifts as a gesture of family tradition. However, the author's age and financial responsibility as a teenager might be a factor. At 15, they might not have a lot of money, and being pressured to spend a large gift card on others could be seen as unfair.\n\nThe key issue here is the pressure from family members. The author made a choice based on feeling that the family was being greedy. They also mentioned they are very conservative with money, which adds to their perspective. The argument between the author and mom seems to stem from the mom's insistence and the author's reaction to that pressure.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's decision to not buy gifts for family after being pressured might be justified. They had the right to decide how to use their money, especially since the gift card was a personal win. The family's reaction might be more about their expectations than the author's actions. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
