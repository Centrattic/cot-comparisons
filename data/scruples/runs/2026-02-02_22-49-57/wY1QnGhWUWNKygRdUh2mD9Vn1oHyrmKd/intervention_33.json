I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members using a gift card they won. The person is 15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person won a $400 Target gift card and shared it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and told their mom, which led to the mom demanding gifts for her and the sister. Then the mom added more people\u2014two cousins. The person felt pressured, changed their mind, and used the money for themselves instead. Their mom was upset and guilt-tripped them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The gift card was a windfall, not earned money. The person is a teenager, which might mean they have less financial responsibility. However, in some cultures, buying gifts for family is expected, especially for holidays. But the mom added more people after the initial request, which could be seen as excessive. The cousins are young and not seen often, so the necessity of expensive gifts might be questionable. The person set a boundary after feeling pressured, which could be justified. On the other hand, not giving gifts might be considered rude in some families. But the mom's reaction was harsh, and the person's decision to prioritize their own needs after being pressured might be reasonable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because of the pressure and the family's overreach, but there's a cultural aspect to consider. However, since the person is a minor and the situation involves parental expectations, there's a balance. But given the context, the author's actions seem justified.\n"
