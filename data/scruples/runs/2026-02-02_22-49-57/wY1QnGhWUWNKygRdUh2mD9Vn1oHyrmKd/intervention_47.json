I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author receiving a gift card, and then family members pressuring them to use it for gifts. The author ends up keeping the money for themselves and not giving anything to the family, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author received a $400 gift card. They told their sister about it, who then told their mom, which the author was upset about. The mom then demanded gifts for the sister and the author's cousins. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money, buying themselves things instead. The mom was upset and accused the author of being greedy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to their own money, the pressure from family, the initial bragging leading to the mom finding out, and the subsequent conflict. The author is 15 years old, which is important because their maturity level and understanding of financial responsibility might be different.\n\nNow, considering the author's age, they might not have a lot of financial resources. The gift card was a windfall, and they were cautious about spending it. The mom and family members added pressure to use it for gifts, which the author felt was excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and not feel obligated to spend on family members who didn't contribute to the gift card might be seen as reasonable. However, the family might view this as selfish, especially if there's an expectation of sharing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did agree initially to get gifts for mom and sister, then the mom expanded it to cousins. The author felt pressured and changed their mind. The mom's reaction of guilt-tripping and yelling is problematic, but the author's response of cutting off communication and not following through could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if there's an expectation of holiday gifts in the family.\n\nBut considering the context: the author is a teenager, the mom overstepped by pressuring them, and the author was trying to manage their finances responsibly. The author's anger at being accused of greed and the mom's overstepping might be justified. The fact that the author was buying for a friend and themselves, and the family's reaction, suggests the author isn't being selfish but standing up for their own financial boundaries.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The family's pressure and the mom's reaction are more at fault. The author had the right to decide how to spend their money, especially after being pressured. So the answer would be B.\n"
