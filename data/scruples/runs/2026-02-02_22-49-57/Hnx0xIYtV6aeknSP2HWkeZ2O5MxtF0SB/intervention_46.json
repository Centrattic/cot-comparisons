With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy (17 M) who's been dating his girlfriend (18 F) for almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring another girl (his 20-year-old friend) with them. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. The author argues that the friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety, and he wants to give back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a big deal for many people, a traditional \"special night\" for high schoolers. She's in a relationship with him, so she might naturally expect it to be just the two of them. Her feeling hurt or excluded makes sense. On the other hand, the author is trying to repay a friend who had a tough time missing her own prom. The friend was important in helping him build social skills.\n\nI wonder if the author communicated his intentions clearly. The girlfriend might not understand the depth of the relationship with the friend or the significance of bringing her along. Maybe there's a communication gap here. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back, which is a valid point. However, the girlfriend might see it as prioritizing someone else over the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: some people might argue that inviting a third person to prom, especially a girl, could be seen as crossing a line in a relationship. Even if the friend is just coming along, the girlfriend might feel it's an intrusion. But others might say the friend's role in the author's life is important and shouldn't be disregarded.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. Prom is often seen as a couple's event, but maybe the author's friend has a valid reason (never went to prom). However, the girlfriend's expectations are also valid. The key here is whether the author's actions are considered inconsiderate. If the friend is just joining without romantic implications, then maybe the author isn't wrong. However, if the girlfriend perceives it as the author being more invested in the friend's inclusion than her own feelings, that's a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because he's recognizing the friend's importance in his life. But he might not have considered the girlfriend's feelings enough. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's perspective is valid and the author's actions might have ignored her feelings, maybe there's some fault on his part. But if the friend is just a plus-one and not a romantic partner, then maybe not. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the answer being B, not in the wrong, but I'm not 100% sure. The key points are about gratitude and the friend's role in his life. However, he should have communicated better with his girlfriend to find a compromise. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about communication. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
