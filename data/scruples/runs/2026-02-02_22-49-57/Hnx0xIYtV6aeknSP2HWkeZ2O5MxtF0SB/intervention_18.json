With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he's 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating close to a year. The friend in question is 20 and he wants to take her because she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. He explains that this friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and lack of social skills, and he wants to give back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's upset because she wants prom to be their special night and doesn't want to share him. Prom is traditionally a romantic event for couples, so her desire for it to be just the two of them is understandable. The idea of bringing someone else might make her feel less important or less of a priority. Trust and communication are key in relationships, and if the boyfriend went ahead without considering her feelings, that could be an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning is that this friend helped him significantly, and he wants to honor that by including her. He might see it as a way to show gratitude. However, the problem is that prom is a couple's event, and bringing another person, even a friend, could be seen as violating the norm of exclusivity during such a milestone. The friend not being in a relationship and not having had a prom experience doesn't necessarily justify including her, especially if it causes conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nAnother angle is whether the boyfriend discussed this with his girlfriend in a respectful and understanding way. If he's being dismissive of her feelings and insisting on his own desires without compromise, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's feelings are valid; she might feel like her partner isn't respecting the significance of the event as a couple. The boyfriend's action could be seen as prioritizing his own gratitude towards a friend over his partner's emotional needs, which is a common point of contention in relationships.\n\nIn terms of social norms, bringing someone else to a prom date is generally considered inappropriate unless it's a group event. The boyfriend's intention might be good, but the execution lacks consideration for his girlfriend's perspective. The key here is whether he's willing to listen to her concerns and find a middle ground. If he's not open to discussion and insists on bringing the friend, that would place the responsibility on him. However, if he's trying to explain his reasons and seek a compromise, it's a different scenario.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the boyfriend's desire to show gratitude is understandable, but the girlfriend's feelings about the event being exclusive to them are also valid. The main issue is the lack of mutual consideration and communication. The boyfriend might be in the wrong if he's not addressing her concerns adequately and pushing his own agenda without regard to her feelings. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because the action disrupts the couple's expectation for a special night, and he's not fully respecting his girlfriend's perspective.\n"
