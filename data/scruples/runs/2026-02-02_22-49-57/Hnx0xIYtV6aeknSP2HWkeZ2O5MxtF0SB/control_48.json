With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The author is in a romantic relationship with his girlfriend, who is 18, and he's 17. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is a significant event, typically a couple's night. The girlfriend wants it to be just the two of them, which is understandable as it's their special time together.\n\nThen there's the friend, a 20-year-old who never went to prom because she was in the hospital. The author feels this friend helped him develop social skills, especially when he was struggling with anxiety. He wants to include her as a way to give back. But the girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be exclusive to them.\n\nSo, the main conflict is between the girlfriend's expectation of a private date and the author's desire to include someone who's been supportive. The key points are the girlfriend's feelings of being exclusive and the author's gratitude towards the friend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, respecting a partner's wishes is important in a relationship. The girlfriend has a right to expect that prom, as a shared event, is for the two of them. Bringing another person could be seen as not respecting her feelings and the significance of the event. However, the author's intention is to thank a friend who helped him, which is a valid sentiment. \n\nBut in relationships, considering the partner's perspective and feelings is crucial. Even if the friend's story is touching, the girlfriend's primary concern is the exclusivity of the prom night. The author might need to communicate more and perhaps find another way to include the friend without compromising the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's disregarding his girlfriend's feelings about the event being their special night. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's perspective needs to be respected. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n"
