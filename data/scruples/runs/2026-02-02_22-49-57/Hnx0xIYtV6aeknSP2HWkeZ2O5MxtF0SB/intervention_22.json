With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl (a close friend) to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend to prom with them because the friend missed out on her prom due to hospitalization. The friend is important to him, helped him with social skills and anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nI should consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that prom is a special event for couples, so she might feel that having another person there could detract from their intimacy. On the other hand, the author feels a moral obligation to his friend who helped him significantly. The friend's absence from prom is a key factor here.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no rule against bringing someone else, but it's a relationship issue. The main conflict is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus fulfilling a personal obligation to a friend. The author's intention is to give back, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation that prom should be just for couples? In some contexts, yes, but it can vary. The problem is whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings before making the request. He did mention discussing prom plans with her, but the issue arises when the friend is involved. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as prioritizing a friend over the girlfriend's wishes. Even if the friend didn't know about the help, the author's decision might be perceived as disregarding the girlfriend's need for a private moment. However, the friend's situation (missing her prom) adds a layer of compassion. \n\nI need to weigh the importance of the friend's need for the experience versus the girlfriend's right to a shared special night. The fact that the friend is important to the author's personal growth is significant. But the girlfriend's feelings shouldn't be dismissed. \n\nIt's possible that the author didn't communicate this plan to his girlfriend in a way that explained the significance to the friend, leading to her feeling overlooked. If the author had discussed the friend's situation and the reasons for including her, maybe there could be compromise. But as it stands, the girlfriend feels it's their night, and the author is pushing for another person's inclusion. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his intentions are genuine. However, not considering the girlfriend's perspective fully could be a mistake. The answer might depend on whether the author acted without considering her feelings, which he might have done if he didn't communicate the reasons effectively. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No) because the author's intentions are based on gratitude, but there's also a need to consider the girlfriend's feelings. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are being overlooked, maybe it's a mix. But the question is strictly whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's opposition is about their special night, and the author is trying to do something for a friend, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the girlfriend is the one who's dating him and wants the night to herself, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting her wishes despite his good intentions.\n"
