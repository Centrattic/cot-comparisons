With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that the author is a 17-year-old guy in a relationship with an 18-year-old girl. They've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, who's 20 and a significant person in his life, to prom with them. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night. The author feels he's giving back to his friend who helped him a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is often seen as a romantic event, so her wanting it to be just the two of them is understandable. She might feel like including another girl could take away from that experience. On the other hand, the author has a valid reason for wanting to include his friend. The friend helped him develop socially and supported him during a tough time. He sees this as an opportunity to show gratitude.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication and compromise. The author's intention is good, but he needs to consider his girlfriend's feelings. However, the fact that the friend is a girl might complicate things. The girlfriend could perceive it as the author prioritizing someone else over their relationship. But the author's motivation isn't selfish; it's about repayment and friendship. \n\nBut the core issue here is whether including a third person is appropriate. In a romantic relationship, bringing someone else to a date could be seen as a breach of expectations, especially if the other person isn't a mutual friend or family. The girlfriend's concern about it being their special night is valid. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier, maybe before finalizing the plans. Since the girlfriend is opposed, the author should respect her feelings to maintain trust and avoid hurt. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while his intentions are good, the action of bringing another girl to a date without considering his girlfriend's perspective might not be respectful of her needs in the relationship. Relationships often require putting the partner's feelings first in such situations.\n"
