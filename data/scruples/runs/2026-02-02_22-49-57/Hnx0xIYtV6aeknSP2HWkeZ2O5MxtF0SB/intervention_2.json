With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating for almost a year. Prom is coming up, and the author wants to bring another girl, his friend, with them. The friend is female, 20, and she missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The author says this friend was really important to him when he started his job, helped him with social anxiety, and he feels he should give back to her. The girlfriend is against it because she wants the prom to be a special night just for them. The author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is inviting a third person to a date event. Prom is typically a date event between two people. By bringing a friend, the author is changing the dynamic from a couple's night to a group outing. The girlfriend's concern is about having the night just for them, which is understandable because prom is often seen as a significant and personal event for couples.\n\nThe author argues that his friend helped him a lot, and he wants to give back. That's a valid reason, but it's important to weigh that against the girlfriend's feelings. Communication is key in relationships. The author might have had good intentions, but he should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making the decision. If the girlfriend feels that her feelings were disregarded, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the expectation of exclusivity in a dating relationship. While friends can be important, a prom date is usually a more exclusive arrangement. The girlfriend might feel that including another person, even a friend, makes her feel less prioritized. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if he didn't take her feelings into account, even if his intentions were good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend has a valid reason for missing prom, and the author wants to make up for that. It's a nice gesture, but perhaps it should be done in another way, like going out with the friend separately. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to do something kind for a friend, but the way he approached it without considering his girlfriend's perspective could be the issue.\n\nSo, the crux here is whether the author's action of including a third person without his girlfriend's consent was wrong. If he didn't communicate his plans and her feelings were hurt, then he might be at fault. The girlfriend's right to an exclusive date night is important, and the author's action, while well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping if it was done without mutual agreement. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is at least partially in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings and expectations for the event.\n"
