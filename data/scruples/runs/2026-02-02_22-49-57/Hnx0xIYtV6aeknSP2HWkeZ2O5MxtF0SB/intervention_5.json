With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation involves the author, his girlfriend, and a close female friend who missed prom due to health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the parties. The author has been in a relationship for almost a year and is now 17. His girlfriend is 18, so they're both young and possibly still navigating relationship expectations. The friend in question is important to the author because she helped him develop social skills when he was struggling with anxiety. She's a significant support figure, and he wants to include her in prom to make up for her missing out on her own prom.\n\nThe girlfriend is opposed because she wants the night to be special for just the two of them. The author argues that the friend has helped him a lot and that this is a way to show gratitude. The central issue here is about balancing personal relationships and the expectations of a romantic partner.\n\nI should think about the potential factors. On one hand, the author's intention is to thank a friend who supported him. Prom is a significant event, and including someone else could be seen as respectful of their relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her feelings for exclusivity are being disregarded. The question is whether the author is inconsiderate by not prioritizing his girlfriend's wishes in this case.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the girlfriend. If she feels that her partner is prioritizing a friend over her, it could lead to hurt feelings or a sense of being undervalued. However, the author's reasoning is rooted in gratitude towards a friend who played a crucial role in his personal growth.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms around prom. Prom is often seen as a special event for couples, so bringing someone else might be viewed as unusual. However, the author is bringing a friend, not a date, which might be different. Still, the girlfriend's perspective is valid; she might expect that her partner would consider her feelings first in such a scenario.\n\nThe key here is whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings and communicated effectively. The story mentions that the girlfriend is opposed, but it's unclear if the author has tried to find a compromise. For example, could they involve the friend in a different way without bringing her to prom? The author's reasoning is valid, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't acting out of malice but out of a desire to show gratitude, but he might not be considering his girlfriend's emotional needs as much as he should. The girlfriend's request for exclusivity is reasonable. The author might be in the wrong if he's not willing to listen to her concerns and find an alternative solution. However, if he's making a genuine effort to balance both relationships, he might not be at fault. \n\nGiven the information, the author's intentions are good, but the execution might be missing the mark. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should address her concerns, perhaps by finding another way to include his friend without compromising the special night for their relationship. If the author insists on bringing the friend despite the girlfriend's objections, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether there's a compromise. Since the scenario doesn't mention attempts at compromise, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings as much as he should.\n"
