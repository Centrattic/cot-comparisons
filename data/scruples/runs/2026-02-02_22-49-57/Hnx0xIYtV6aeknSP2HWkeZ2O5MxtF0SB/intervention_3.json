With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl with him and his girlfriend to prom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a 17-year-old guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's 18. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to invite his female friend, who's 20, because she never got to go to prom. The friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and helped him build social skills. He sees this as a way to give back. However, his girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night and doesn't want the other girl there.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author's intention is to include someone who's been supportive, but his girlfriend feels it's their special time. There's a conflict between his desire to acknowledge his friend and his girlfriend's expectations for the prom night. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are important. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might see prom as a significant milestone that should be shared just between the two of them. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and repayment, which is understandable. However, bringing another person to what's traditionally a couple's event without considering the partner's feelings could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut then again, the author didn't invite the friend as a date, just to include her. However, prom is typically a date event, so adding someone else might make the girlfriend feel like she's not the priority. The author's friend had a valid reason for missing prom, and the author's gratitude is a strong point. Still, in a relationship, the partner's feelings should be a priority, especially when planning a shared event. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action is inconsiderate. He might not be in the wrong because he's trying to do a good thing for a friend, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective until after the fact. Maybe he should have discussed it with her first. But the girlfriend's reaction is also valid. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consult his girlfriend before making plans that affect her. Prom is a special event for couples, so bringing someone else without her input could be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the friend's situation is unique and the author's gratitude is a factor. \n\nI think the main issue is that the author didn't communicate his plans in a way that considered his girlfriend's feelings. Since relationships require teamwork, he should have discussed it more thoroughly and maybe found a compromise, like attending the prom together with the friend but not as a trio, or finding another way to celebrate with the friend. Since he didn't do that, it's possible he's at fault. But if the friend wasn't a date, maybe it's different. However, the girlfriend's perspective is important here. So I'm leaning towards A, that he's in the wrong, because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings in the planning.\n"
