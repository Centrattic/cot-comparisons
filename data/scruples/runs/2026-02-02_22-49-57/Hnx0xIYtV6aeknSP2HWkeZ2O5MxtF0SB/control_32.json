With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user is a 17-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend. His friend, a 20-year-old woman, missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped him develop social skills when he was struggling with anxiety. Now, he wants to include her in his prom plans. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special and for him to be with her only.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's history with the user, the girlfriend's perspective, and the nature of prom typically being a couple event. The user feels he's giving back to a friend who helped him a lot. But the girlfriend sees it as her special time with her boyfriend.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the user has a valid reason\u2014his friend was important in his personal growth. On the other hand, prom is usually a couple's event, and the girlfriend is feeling hurt that he wants to include someone else. The girlfriend's feelings are important here. The user might not have considered how this would make his partner feel, even if his intentions are good.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Prom is traditionally a two-person event, so inviting another person might be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. The user might be prioritizing his friend's experience over his partner's feelings. However, the user is trying to do something kind for a friend. But in a committed relationship, the partner's feelings should be a priority. The user might not be in the wrong entirely, but he should have discussed this more carefully with his girlfriend. Maybe there's a compromise, like the friend attending separately. But the main issue is that the girlfriend is upset, and the user's request could be seen as neglecting her feelings. So maybe answer A (the user is in the wrong) because he's disregarding his partner's feelings for a friend's benefit. But I need to check if the reasoning is sound. The user's intentions are good, but in a relationship, the partner's emotional needs are important. So the answer might be A.\n"
