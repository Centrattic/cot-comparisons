With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to include a female friend who missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped him a lot with social skills and overcoming anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be special for just the two of them.\n\nNow, the key points here are trust and communication. The boyfriend suddenly introduces the idea of bringing another girl, which the girlfriend finds disappointing. Even if the friend is important, bringing her to a date night could be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she expects exclusivity on a special occasion. The author's reasoning is about gratitude, but he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings first. \n\nAlso, the friend's situation is sad, but the prom is a private event between the couple. Including someone else without the girlfriend's agreement might be crossing a boundary. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing a friend over the girlfriend's emotional needs in this context. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. He didn't communicate better or consider the girlfriend's feelings about the event being exclusive. Even with good intentions, the girlfriend's feelings are important here.\n"
