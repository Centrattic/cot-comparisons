With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old guy in a relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to take his friend, a 20-year-old girl, with them. His friend never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital. She's been a big help to him at work, where he had social anxiety and lacked social skills. She treated him like a friend and helped him improve. He feels like taking her to prom is a way to give back.\n\nHis girlfriend is against it because she wants prom night to be their special time. He thinks he's justified because of the reasons mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is traditionally a romantic event, so she might see it as a night just for the two of them. Bringing another person could feel like a betrayal or a lack of consideration for her feelings. She might feel left out or that her partner isn't prioritizing their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid reason. His friend helped him through a tough time, and this could be a way to acknowledge her support. He's trying to do something nice for someone who was important in his growth. But does that outweigh his girlfriend's feelings?\n\nI should also think about the dynamics of their relationship. If they've been together a year, prom would be a significant milestone. The girlfriend might have expected it to be a private, intimate event. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting her wishes, even if his intentions are good.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend is a girl, and the girlfriend might feel jealous or insecure. Even if there's no romantic interest, the presence of another woman could be a point of contention. The author needs to consider how his actions affect the trust and comfort in the relationship.\n\nBut then, maybe the author isn't wrong because he's trying to honor a friend's experience. However, the girlfriend's feelings are also important. The key here is communication. Did the author consult with his girlfriend before making the decision? The girlfriend is opposed, so the author is going against her wishes. That could be a problem, regardless of his intentions.\n\nSo, if the girlfriend's feelings are being disregarded, even with good intentions, the author might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if he had discussed it more and tried to find a compromise, maybe it's different. But as it stands, he's pushing to include someone else despite her opposition. That could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nI think the main issue is respecting the girlfriend's wishes versus the author's desire to do something for a friend. Since the girlfriend is the one in the relationship, her feelings about the event should take priority. The author's actions might be seen as not respecting her perspective. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
