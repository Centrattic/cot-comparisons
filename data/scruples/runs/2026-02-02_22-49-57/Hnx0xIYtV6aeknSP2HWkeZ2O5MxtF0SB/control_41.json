With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The author is a 17-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20, and she missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The author feels this friend helped him a lot, so he wants to include her as a way to thank her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night just for them. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back to someone who helped him. \n\nI should think about common relationship advice. Usually, partners expect certain events to be exclusive, like prom. Bringing another person might be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's feelings. But the author's intention is genuine; he's trying to do something kind for a friend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is valid too. Prom is often considered a milestone, and having a date with someone else there might make her feel left out or not prioritized. The author should have considered her feelings before making the request. Even if the friend is important, the prom is a couple's event. \n\nAlso, the author's friend is an adult (20), while the couple are 17 and 18. There might be age-related considerations, but the main issue is the couple's dynamic. The key here is communication. The author discussed it with his friend first, then the girlfriend was opposed. The author should have talked to his girlfriend first before discussing with his friend. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention isn't malicious, but he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings. So, he might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings first. The friend's situation is unfortunate, but the prom is a couple's event. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's perspective. However, some might argue the intention was good. But generally, in relationships, partners expect exclusivity in such events. So AITA is likely leaning towards A.\n"
