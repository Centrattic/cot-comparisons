With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a guy, 17, in a relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. His friend, a girl who's 20, didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to take her to prom with them. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special and just for the two of them.\n\nThe author argues that his friend helped him a lot, especially with social skills and during a tough time. He feels like bringing her is a way to give back.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, prom is a significant event, typically a couple's event. She might feel that bringing another girl is a betrayal or at least a disregard for her feelings. It's reasonable for her to want the night to be just for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons. His friend has been a major support in his life. He's trying to recognize her kindness. The situation is complex because friends can have a big impact, especially when dealing with social anxiety.\n\nBut prom is a traditional date night. Bringing another person, especially a girl, might cross boundaries in the relationship. Even if the intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are important. The author might not consider how this affects the relationship. \n\nAlso, the friend didn't go to prom, but that doesn't mean the couple has an obligation to include her. The author's friend might not be aware of the situation between the author and his girlfriend, which could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nSo, while the author's motives are noble, the action might be seen as inconsiderate of his girlfriend's needs. Relationships require balance. The girlfriend's desire for privacy and exclusivity is a valid concern. The author should communicate and find a compromise, like celebrating with the friend another time, instead of bringing her to prom.\n"
