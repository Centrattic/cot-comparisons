With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author (17M) and his girlfriend (18F) have been dating almost a year. He has a female friend (20F) who missed her prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to include her as a way of saying thanks since she helped him with social skills and through social anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship between the author and his girlfriend. They've been together nearly a year, which is significant, and prom is a big event. The girlfriend wants it to be just the two of them, which makes sense because it's a special night for couples. But the author feels a moral obligation to include his friend who helped him a lot.\n\nEthically, is the author wrong? On one hand, he's trying to be kind to a friend who's important to him. On the other, he's potentially disregarding his girlfriend's feelings about the event. The question is about whether his actions are inconsiderate or if he's justified in his reasoning.\n\nI should think about typical prom traditions. Usually, it's a couples' event, so inviting a third person might disrupt that. The girlfriend's perspective is key here\u2014she's upset because she wants their special time. But the author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back. \n\nIs there a compromise? Maybe the friend can go with another friend or do something else. But the author's insistence on including her might be seen as prioritizing his friend over his girlfriend's wishes. That could be inconsiderate. However, the author's intent is noble, but intentions don't always override the impact on the partner. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are respecting his girlfriend's wishes. If he's ignoring her feelings and pushing for his own agenda, that's a problem. But if he's trying to find a solution that makes both parties feel valued, maybe he's not. But since he's asking if he's in the wrong, the key point is whether inviting the friend is wrong. Social norms might suggest that bringing a third person to a couples-only event is inappropriate, which could make the author at fault. However, the motivation is good, so maybe not in the wrong. \n\nBut in relationships, considering the partner's feelings is crucial. Even if the motive is good, not respecting the partner's desire for a private night might be considered wrong. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for their special night. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the action is seen as kind and the girlfriend should be more flexible. \n\nI think the answer is A because the girlfriend's feelings and the social norm of prom being a couples' event are important. The author might be overstepping by not considering her perspective enough.\n"
