With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating for almost a year. The friend in question is 20 and missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The author feels this friend helped him a lot by being supportive and improving his social skills. He wants to include her in their prom to give back, but his girlfriend is upset because it's supposed to be their special night.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. In a committed relationship, partners usually expect exclusivity, especially for events like prom. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special time together, so bringing someone else could be seen as a breach of that expectation. On the other hand, the author's intention is to show gratitude to a friend who helped him. \n\nBut here's the thing: Prom is typically a romantic event between couples. Inviting a third person, especially another girl, might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized or even embarrassed. The author's reasoning is heartfelt, but relationships often require considering the partner's feelings as well. The girlfriend has a right to expect that their significant event is just the two of them. \n\nAdditionally, the age difference and the fact that the friend is a girl might add complexity. Even if the author's intentions are good, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. The core issue here is about mutual respect and understanding each other's expectations. The author might need to communicate more and find a way to honor his friend without compromising his relationship. \n\nSo, while the author's motives are positive, the action might be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, he could be in the wrong from her perspective. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a middle ground. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the answer is likely A.\n"
