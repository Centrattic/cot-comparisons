With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the user (17 M) wants to take his friend (20 F) to prom with his girlfriend (18 F). The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The user has been with his girlfriend for almost a year. The friend is important because she helped him with social anxiety and was a good friend to him when he started the job. The friend missed her prom due to hospitalization, so he wants to include her as a way to give back.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Bringing another person to a date that's supposed to be a couple's event can be seen as problematic. The girlfriend's main concern is that it's their special night and she wants to be with him alone. The user's justification is the friend's history and his gratitude, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to do something kind for his friend, but he also needs to consider his girlfriend's feelings. Did he present this idea to her before discussing it at work? The girlfriend might feel left out or not prioritized. The user's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend's wishes, even if the intention is good.\n\nThe friend's age is 20, same as the girlfriend, which might not matter, but the situation is that the friend is already close to the user. Including her in a couples event might cause jealousy or hurt feelings. The user is in a tight spot, trying to balance his gratitude towards his friend and his commitment to his girlfriend.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and how the action affects the other person. The user's intention is good, but the effect is causing conflict. The girlfriend's perspective is that the prom is about their relationship, so bringing someone else might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the user is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's feelings without finding a compromise. Even though the intent is positive, the impact on the girlfriend is negative, and relationships require mutual respect and consideration.\n"
