With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author (17M) has been dating his girlfriend (18F) for almost a year. He wants to invite his friend (20F) who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. His friend helped him a lot with social skills and overcoming anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's reasons. The girlfriend feels it should be their special night and doesn't want another girl there. The author wants to include his friend as a gesture of gratitude, which is understandable given the friend's support.\n\nBut, in a committed relationship, the partner's feelings are important. The girlfriend might feel that including another girl in such a significant event could be a breach of trust or diminish the exclusivity of their relationship. The author's argument is about giving back to a friend, but relationships often require balancing personal friendships with the partner's comfort levels.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action would be considered wrong. Some might say that the girlfriend's feelings should take priority because prom is typically a romantic event. Others might argue that the author is justified in wanting to include someone who helped him. However, the fact that the girlfriend is opposed and it's a special occasion for them could mean the author is in the wrong for not respecting her feelings. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author talked to his friend at work about prom without discussing it with his girlfriend first, which might have contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend's main issue is that she wants it to be their night, so including someone else might not be the right decision here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the prom is a traditional romantic event. The author's intentions are good, but he might be ignoring his girlfriend's perspective. However, there's a counter-argument that his friend's situation is unique and he's trying to do the right thing. But in the context of relationships, partners usually expect exclusivity in such events. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
