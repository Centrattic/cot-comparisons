With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer, a 17-year-old guy, wants to invite his close female friend to the prom with him and his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be a special, just-the-two-of-them event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend is important because she helped the writer develop social skills when he was struggling. She missed her prom due to being in the hospital, and he wants to make up for that. The girlfriend feels this is their night and doesn't want the friend to come along.\n\nSo, the main question is whether including the friend is wrong. Let's look at possible angles. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, prom is a traditional event for couples. She might see it as a time to focus on their relationship. If the boyfriend brings another girl, that could feel like a betrayal or lack of respect for their relationship. She might feel that he's prioritizing his friend over her, which could lead to hurt feelings or trust issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer is trying to do something kind for a friend who supported him through a tough time. The friend didn't get to experience prom, and he wants to give back. But in doing so, he's possibly overstepping by bringing her to a couples' event. There's a line between being a good friend and respecting the boundaries of a romantic relationship. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The writer should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making the decision. Even if the intention is good, not involving her in the planning could be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might view the prom as a significant milestone in their relationship. \n\nAlso, the social dynamics of prom. In many cultures, prom is a couples' event. Bringing someone else might disrupt that dynamic. However, some schools or regions might be more open to group outings. The writer might not be aware of the usual expectations, but if his girlfriend is upset, that's a sign he should reconsider.\n\nThe writer's argument is about giving back, but the girlfriend's request for a private night is a relational boundary. Respecting boundaries is a key part of any relationship. Even if the friend's absence from prom is a valid reason, the way the writer is addressing it might not consider his girlfriend's perspective sufficiently.\n\nSo, while the writer's intentions are good and his friend's situation is sympathetic, the action of inviting her to the prom could be seen as insensitive to his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend has a right to feel that her partner is prioritizing someone else's experience over their shared moment. The writer might be in the wrong here because he's not respecting her wishes and the traditional context of the event. The correct choice would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
