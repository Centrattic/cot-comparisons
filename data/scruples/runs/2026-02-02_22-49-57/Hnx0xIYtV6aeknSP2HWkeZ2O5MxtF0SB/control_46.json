With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. The author wants to invite his friend, who's 20, to prom with them. The friend missed prom due to hospitalization. He feels this friend helped him a lot socially and wants to thank her. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks prom should be their special night.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back to someone who supported him. That's a valid point. But the girlfriend's perspective is about wanting the night to be just the two of them. Prom is traditionally a couples' event. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships involve mutual respect. The girlfriend's feelings are important. The author should have discussed this with her before making plans. Even if there's a good reason, not considering her feelings might be a mistake. However, the author's intention is positive. But the main issue is whether it's wrong to bring another girl. \n\nIn many relationships, exclusivity is expected, especially in public events like prom. Bringing another girl might cross a boundary. The girlfriend's objection is about wanting to spend the night together, which is a common expectation. The author's action could be seen as inconsiderate, even if his intentions are good. \n\nBut the author also has valid points about the friend's importance. However, relationships require compromise. The author should have communicated better. So, the answer might lean towards \"A\" (author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings first, even if his intentions were good.\n"
