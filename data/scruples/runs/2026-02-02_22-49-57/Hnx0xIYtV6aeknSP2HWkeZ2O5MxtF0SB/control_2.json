With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves wanting to bring another girl to prom with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to bring his female friend, 20, to prom with them. The friend didn't get to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. He values her as a friend who helped him when he had social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special for just the two of them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy is in the wrong here. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, bringing another person to a couples' event like prom can be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. Prom is typically a time for couples to celebrate together, and adding someone else might make the girlfriend feel like her partner isn't prioritizing their relationship. The girlfriend's feelings about wanting the night to be \"special\" and exclusive are valid. Trust and exclusivity are important in relationships, so the guy's decision might be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy has a legitimate reason. His friend helped him through a tough time, and he wants to give back. He mentions that this friend was crucial in improving his social skills. His intention isn't to disrespect his girlfriend but to honor his friend's past and show gratitude. However, he should have communicated better with his girlfriend. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The situation might have been handled better if he discussed this with her earlier and explained the significance, rather than waiting until after she was already opposed.\n\nBut the main issue is that prom is traditionally a two-person event. Inviting a third person could be seen as ignoring the girlfriend's expectations. The fact that the girlfriend is 18 and the guy is 17, both adults (though minors), but their relationship norms would still apply. The girlfriend's discomfort is justified because she expects this night to be about the two of them. The guy's friend's backstory is touching, but the context of prom as a couples' event is important. The guy might not be \"in the wrong\" intentionally, but his actions could be careless of his girlfriend's feelings. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend is hurt and feels her needs aren't considered, then he is in the wrong. But if his intentions are good and the girlfriend's reaction is overblown, maybe not. But given that relationships require mutual consideration, the guy should have considered her feelings before making the decision. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event. However, if the girlfriend's reaction is too extreme, maybe not. But typically, bringing a third person to a couples' event without the partner's consent is seen as a mistake. So the answer is likely A.\n"
