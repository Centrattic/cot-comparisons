With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring a friend to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night just for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a 17-year-old guy with an 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is a 20-year-old female who helped him a lot with social anxiety. She missed her prom, and he wants to take her as a way to give back. His girlfriend is against this because she wants the night to herself.\n\nSo, the key points are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include a close friend. The girlfriend is in a relationship and might feel that prom is a significant event that should be exclusive to the couple. On the other hand, the author sees this as a chance to thank a friend who supported him through a tough time.\n\nI should think about what's more important here. In a relationship, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's in the relationship and might feel that this event is about their bonding. However, the author's intention to acknowledge his friend's role in his life is also understandable.\n\nIs the author being inconsiderate by not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings? Or is he being fair by wanting to honor a friend who helped him? The answer might depend on the cultural context or how prom is typically viewed in their community. In some places, prom is strictly a couples' event, while in others, it's more social.\n\nBut the core issue is the girlfriend's objection. Even if the author's reasons are noble, he needs to consider her feelings. If he goes ahead, it might hurt her and show a lack of respect for her wishes. On the other hand, if he's willing to find a compromise, like inviting the friend to a different event, that might be a better solution.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, by not considering his girlfriend's feelings first, he might be. The girlfriend's desire for an exclusive night is a valid relationship concern. The author's actions could be seen as prioritizing a friend over the girlfriend's needs, which might be inconsiderate. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings in the relationship are equally important. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for their special night.\n"
