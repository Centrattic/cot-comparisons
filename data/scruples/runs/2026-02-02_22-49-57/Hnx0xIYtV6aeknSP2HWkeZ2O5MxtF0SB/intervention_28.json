With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy wants to bring his friend, a girl who never went to prom, to prom with him and his girlfriend. His girlfriend is against it because she wants it to be their special night. The guy's reasoning is that this friend helped him a lot, helped him with social anxiety and being more social, and he wants to give back to her.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the dynamics between the guy, his girlfriend, and the friend. The girlfriend is his significant other, and prom is typically a special event, often seen as a couple's event. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their night, and she wants his attention. On the other hand, the guy feels that this friend has done a lot for him and wants to include her as a way to show gratitude.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the guy's intention to repay a favor to a friend, the girlfriend's desire for a private, couple-focused event, and the potential impact on their relationship. The question is whether the guy is in the wrong by wanting to include his friend without his girlfriend's approval.\n\nI think the main issue is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the guy has valid reasons, the girlfriend's discomfort or hurt feelings need to be considered. The guy might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of having good intentions, but he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes by pushing to include someone else. Relationships require communication and compromise. If the girlfriend is clearly against it, the guy should consider her feelings more. The fact that the friend is important to him is understandable, but the girlfriend is his partner, and her feelings about the event should be prioritized. It's possible to find another way to thank his friend without infringing on the girlfriend's expectations for the prom night. So, maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting his partner's wishes despite good intentions.\n"
