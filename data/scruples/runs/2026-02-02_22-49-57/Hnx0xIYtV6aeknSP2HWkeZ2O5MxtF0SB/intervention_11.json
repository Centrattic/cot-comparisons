With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, who's a girl, to prom with them. His friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital. She's been a big help to him, helping him with social skills and during his social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night and doesn't want to share him.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Answer A or B.\n\nSo, to decide, I need to consider relationship dynamics and intentions. The author's intention is to thank his friend who helped him a lot. But bringing another person to a date is usually not okay unless both partners agree. The girlfriend's perspective is about wanting their special time. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to show gratitude, but he should have discussed it with his girlfriend earlier. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might feel like her partner isn't prioritizing their relationship. \n\nBut the main point is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't consult her first and she's now upset, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings. But if he tried to explain his reasons and she still doesn't agree, it's a conflict of expectations. \n\nThe key here is that prom is typically a two-person event. Bringing a third person could be seen as going against the norm and not respecting the girlfriend's wishes. The author's justification is about gratitude, but relationships often require compromise. \n\nSo, even though his intentions are good, the action of wanting to bring another girl without her consent might be inconsiderate. Therefore, he could be in the wrong. But maybe not entirely if he's trying to make it right by seeking opinions. Hmm. This is tricky. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because bringing a third person to a date without the partner's consent can be seen as disregarding their feelings and the usual social norms of such events. The girlfriend's desire for a special night is a valid concern. Even with good intentions, the action may not be appropriate without mutual agreement.\n"
