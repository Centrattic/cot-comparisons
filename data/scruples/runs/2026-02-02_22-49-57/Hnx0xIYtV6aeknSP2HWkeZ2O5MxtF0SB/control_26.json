With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. Prom is a big event, usually a couples' thing. The author wants to take his female friend, who's 20 and missed her own prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped him a lot with social skills and anxiety when he started his job. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. The author feels he should take her as a way to thank his friend.\n\nSo, from the girlfriend's perspective, prom is their night together. She might feel he's prioritizing someone else's needs over hers. But the author argues it's about giving back to someone who helped him. \n\nLegally and socially, prom is typically for couples. Bringing a third person could disrupt that dynamic. But the friend isn't a romantic partner, just a friend. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back, which is valid, but does that outweigh the girlfriend's feelings?\n\nIt's possible the author didn't communicate his reasons clearly. Maybe he should have considered how the girlfriend would feel before making the request. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling less prioritized. The author might not be in the wrong because he's showing gratitude, but he should also respect his girlfriend's feelings. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he's including a third person in what's supposed to be a couple's event without considering her feelings first. Or B (not in the wrong) because he's showing appreciation for a friend. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe A because respecting the girlfriend's feelings is crucial here. Alternatively, maybe B because the friend isn't a romantic partner and the author's intention is good. Hmm.\n"
