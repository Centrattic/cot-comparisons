With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. They provided a detailed scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating nearly a year. The friend in question is 20 and missed prom due to hospitalization. The author's friend helped him a lot with social anxiety and work, so he wants to include her as a gesture of gratitude.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night together. The author argues it's about giving back to the friend. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Prom is typically a couple's event. Bringing someone else, even a close friend, might be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. The girlfriend's feelings about wanting the night to be just the two of them are valid. The author's intentions are good, but the action might not consider the girlfriend's perspective. The key here is about communication and mutual respect. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend before deciding. Even if the intention is to thank the friend, the girlfriend's feelings about their special night matter. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings first. But there's a strong argument for the friend's backstory. However, the main issue is the boyfriend's decision without her consent. So, leaning towards AITA being on the author's side.\n"
