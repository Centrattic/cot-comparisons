With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, a girl who never went to prom because she was in the hospital, to prom with them. His friend was instrumental in helping him with social skills and overcoming anxiety. He sees this as a chance to thank her. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special and just for them two. \n\nHmm. So the key points here are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's reasons for wanting to include his friend. The girlfriend is the one who's in a committed relationship with him, so her feelings about their special night being exclusive might be valid. On the other hand, the author's reasons for wanting to take his friend are based on gratitude and the friend's past support. \n\nBut wait, the friend is a girl, and bringing her with the couple could be seen as a potential issue, even if the author doesn't have romantic feelings. The girlfriend might feel that this is an intrusion or that the author isn't prioritizing their relationship. Prom is typically a couple's event, so bringing a third person might disrupt that dynamic. \n\nThe author argues it's about giving back, but the girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special time. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If the author hasn't fully discussed the reasons and the girlfriend still insists on the night being exclusive, then he might be overstepping. However, if he's considered her feelings and the importance of the event to her, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the girlfriend has a right to expect that prom, as a significant event in their relationship, would be just the two of them. The author's actions might be seen as not respecting her wishes, even if his intentions are good. So the answer might lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings over his friend's, even if the friend's situation is unfortunate. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) if the context of his gratitude is strong. \n\nBut considering typical relationship dynamics, partners usually expect exclusivity in such events. The girlfriend's objection is about the night being theirs, so the author's insistence might be seen as disregarding her feelings. Therefore, AITA would likely say he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
