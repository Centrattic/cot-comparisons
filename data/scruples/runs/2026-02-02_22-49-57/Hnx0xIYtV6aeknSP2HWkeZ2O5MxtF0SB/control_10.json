With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old male in a one-year relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend. They were planning to go to prom together, but when he was at work, he talked to his 20-year-old friend about it. The friend missed her prom because she was in the hospital, and the author feels that taking her to prom would be a way to give back since she helped him develop social skills when he was struggling with anxiety. The girlfriend is upset and wants the night to be special just for the two of them. The author is conflicted between his desire to help his friend and his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I should consider the norms around prom. Prom is typically a formal event where couples go together, and it's expected to be a romantic or couple-focused event. Bringing another person, especially a friend of the opposite gender, might be seen as unusual or disrespectful to the girlfriend. But the author has a specific reason here, which is to give back to someone who supported him when he was going through a tough time. The friend's absence from her own prom due to hospitalization adds another layer\u2014maybe the author wants to create a new memory for her.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She's the one who is his partner, and she's expecting a special date where they have each other's undivided attention. If the author were to bring another girl, that could be perceived as not valuing her or the significance of the event. It's possible that the author's actions might hurt her feelings, even if his intention is good. The question here is about whether his actions (bringing the friend) are appropriate despite the good intentions.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship dynamics. The author's friend is important to him, but the girlfriend is his partner. Prom is a milestone where couples usually go together, and introducing a third person, even if it's a well-meaning gesture, might not align with the girlfriend's expectations. The author might be overlooking her feelings or the social norms of the event, thinking more about his friend's past experience than the current relationship he has with his girlfriend.\n\nBut then again, maybe the author is trying to do something kind for his friend. It's a generous act, but does it come at the expense of his girlfriend's feelings? The key here is whether the girlfriend was consulted and if the author is prioritizing his friend over his partner without considering her input. Since the girlfriend is opposed, the author is going against her wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's justification is based on gratitude, but relationships often require balancing different commitments and considering partners' feelings.\n\nI should also think about the age differences. The friend is 20, which is a bit older than the author and his girlfriend. While not necessarily a problem, it might affect how the situation is perceived. However, the main issue is the social context of prom and the girlfriend's right to expect a certain level of attention and exclusivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's disregarding his girlfriend's feelings and the traditional expectations of prom without fully considering the impact on their relationship. Even though his intentions are good, the way to give back to his friend could involve other means that don't compromise his girlfriend's experience. The girlfriend's opposition is a valid reason to reconsider the plan, as it's important to respect her boundaries and the nature of the event they've already planned together.\n"
