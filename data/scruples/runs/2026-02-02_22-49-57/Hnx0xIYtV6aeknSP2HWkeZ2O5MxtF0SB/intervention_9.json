With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The main points are that the boyfriend and girlfriend are in a relationship for almost a year, and he wants to take his friend, who missed her prom due to being in the hospital, as a way to repay her for helping him with social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night just for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She might feel that prom is a significant event in their relationship and that including another person could make it less special or even a betrayal. Prom is often seen as a romantic milestone, so her wanting exclusivity makes sense. Her feelings of being excluded or not being prioritized could lead to trust issues or feeling undervalued.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning is about gratitude. His friend helped him a lot, and he wants to give back by including her in this experience. He might see it as a way to honor her support. However, the key issue here is that the girlfriend is already his partner, and inviting someone else could be perceived as putting a third wheel in their date. Even if the friend is just a plus-one, the girlfriend might feel like she's being sidelined.\n\nI should also think about cultural context. In many places, prom is a couples' event, and bringing someone else might not be the norm. The boyfriend might not have considered how this could affect the girlfriend's expectations and feelings. It's possible that he didn't communicate his intentions clearly or consider that his friend's presence could be seen as a breach of their romantic plans.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the friendship. The friend helped him with social anxiety, which is a big deal. However, the boyfriend is in a committed relationship, and his actions should respect that commitment. Bringing a close friend to a couples' event might cross a line, even if there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend might worry about the implications of his close relationship with another woman in a romantic setting.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's approach: did he discuss this with his girlfriend before the conversation at work? If he didn't consult her first, that could be a mistake. Open communication is crucial in relationships, especially when making plans that involve others. If he went ahead and talked to his friend without checking in with his girlfriend first, that could exacerbate the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend's intentions are good\u2014expressing gratitude and wanting to include someone who helped him. But the girlfriend's feelings of wanting a special night for the two of them are valid too. The real issue here is about communication and respect for each other's expectations. The boyfriend might be in the wrong if he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and the traditional expectations around prom as a couples' event. Alternatively, if he had a valid reason and communicated it properly, maybe not. But since the girlfriend is clearly upset and the scenario doesn't mention any prior discussion that resolved this, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate from her perspective.\n"
