With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The girlfriend wants prom to be their special night, but the author wants to include his close female friend who couldn't go to prom before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend feels it should be their special night, which is a valid feeling. Prom is often seen as a romantic milestone, so she might feel that having someone else there could take away from that. On the other hand, the author has a strong connection with this friend, who helped him a lot in developing social skills and overcoming anxiety. He sees it as a chance to give back to her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The girlfriend's perspective is about the romantic significance of prom. The author's perspective is about gratitude and making up for his friend's missed opportunity. \n\nBut there's another angle: bringing another girl to a prom that's supposed to be a couple's event might cause jealousy or hurt feelings. The girlfriend is already opposed, which suggests that this could affect their relationship. The author needs to respect his girlfriend's feelings, even if his intentions are good. \n\nAlso, the friend's situation is that she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. While that's unfortunate, the author's decision to bring her might not be the best way to include her, especially if it causes conflict in his primary relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier, maybe even before confirming his plans. Now that the girlfriend is opposed, he needs to consider her feelings. Even if his reasons are noble, the potential harm to his relationship with his girlfriend could outweigh the benefits. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions are commendable, the act of including another girl in a romantic event without his girlfriend's consent could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's right to have a special night with her partner is also important. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings in this situation.\n"
