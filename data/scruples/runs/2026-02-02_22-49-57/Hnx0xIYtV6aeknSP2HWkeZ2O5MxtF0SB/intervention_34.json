With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the prompt is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year, and he wants to include his friend who missed prom because she was in the hospital. The friend was very supportive of him when he had social anxiety and helped him gain skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around prom. Traditionally, prom is a couple's event, so having another person there might be seen as unusual. But the user's reasoning is about giving back to a friend who helped him. That's a good point. However, the girlfriend is opposed because she wants it to be their special night. \n\nSo, the main conflict here is between the boyfriend's desire to include someone important to him and the girlfriend's expectation of a private, couple-centric event. Relationships often involve balancing individual needs with the partner's feelings. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings about the event being special for them might take precedence. \n\nThe boyfriend's intention is positive\u2014he wants to thank his friend. But the action of bringing her to a date that the girlfriend expects to be exclusive could be hurtful. The key is communication. If he hadn't discussed it with his girlfriend and just went ahead, that would be problematic. In the prompt, he mentions they had a conversation, so he's aware of her feelings. However, he's still going ahead with his plan. \n\nRespecting the girlfriend's wishes is important in a relationship. If she's clearly against it, insisting might be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's absence from prom was due to the hospital, but inviting her to a couple's event could still make the girlfriend feel like her wants aren't respected. \n\nThere might be a compromise. For example, the couple could attend the prom together, and then the boyfriend could take his friend to another event or celebrate with her afterward. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to bring her. \n\nIn many cases, taking a significant other's feelings into account is expected. Even with good intentions, if it causes discomfort, the person might be at fault. So, the boyfriend's actions could be considered wrong because he's prioritizing his own desire to include a friend over his girlfriend's desire for an exclusive date. Unless there's more context, like the girlfriend not valuing his friendships, but the prompt doesn't mention that. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The friend's importance is there, but the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. The boyfriend should have considered how his request would make her feel and maybe found another way to include his friend without compromising the couple's time.\n"
