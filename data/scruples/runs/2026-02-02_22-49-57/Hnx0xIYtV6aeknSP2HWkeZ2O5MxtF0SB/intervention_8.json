With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author wants to bring his friend to prom with him and his girlfriend. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital. The author explains that this friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and lack of social skills. They became close through work, and he feels grateful. His girlfriend, however, is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night just for the two of them.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and is considering bringing another person along, which the girlfriend is against. On one hand, the author has a good reason\u2014he's trying to repay a friend who helped him a lot. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels that prom should be a special time for just the two of them. \n\nI think relationships require both parties to consider each other's feelings. The author might be acting out of gratitude, but maybe he didn't consider how his girlfriend would feel about sharing a significant event. Prom is often seen as a milestone, and having a third person might make his girlfriend feel less prioritized. \n\nBut the author's intention is to give back to a friend who helped him. That's a valid point. However, the key here might be communication. Did the author discuss this with his girlfriend before deciding? The text says they \"sat down to talk about our plans\" but then he talked to his friend at work, which led to this situation. Maybe he didn't fully communicate the importance of this to his girlfriend until later. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is that it's their night. She might feel that having another person there could detract from their special time. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting her feelings, even if his intentions are good. \n\nBut then again, the friend's situation is unique\u2014she missed out on prom. The author is trying to include someone who deserves it. However, relationships also require compromise. The author might need to find a middle ground, like attending a different event with the friend or making up for it another way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's being considerate of both his girlfriend's and his friend's needs, he's in a tough spot. But since he's involving a third person without his girlfriend's consent, maybe that's where the issue lies. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and he should have prioritized discussing this with her first to find a solution that works for both. \n\nTherefore, even though his intentions are good, not considering his girlfriend's feelings could make him at least partially at fault. But maybe it's not a clear yes or no. However, the options are A or B. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for their special night. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to do something kind. But I think the main issue is that he didn't adequately communicate or consider his girlfriend's perspective, making him at least partially responsible. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
