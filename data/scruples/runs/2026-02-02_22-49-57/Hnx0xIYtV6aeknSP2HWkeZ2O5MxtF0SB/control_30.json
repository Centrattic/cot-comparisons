With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So, the situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating for almost a year. The friend in question is 20, and she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The author wants to take her along as a way to thank her for helping him with social skills and getting through social anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants prom to be their special night and feels he should be with her alone. On the other hand, the author feels it's an opportunity to give back to a friend who helped him a lot. \n\nNow, the key points here: Is it wrong to invite another person to a date? Prom is typically a couples' event, but the author's intention is to include someone who's important to him. However, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she expected a special night with just her partner. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back, which is noble, but the girlfriend's expectation of an exclusive night is also valid. Bringing another girl might make the girlfriend feel like she's not the main focus of his attention. \n\nAlso, considering the friend's situation\u2014she didn't get to go to prom. But taking her with them might require the girlfriend to share her boyfriend, which could be seen as selfish from the girlfriend's side, but the author might think it's a kind gesture. \n\nIt's a conflict between the girlfriend's desire for a private moment and the author's desire to include someone who's helped him. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed this with the girlfriend earlier and tried to find a compromise. But the main issue is that the girlfriend feels her expectations are being ignored. \n\nSo, is the author's action wrong? It depends on how you look at it. If the friend is coming as a third wheel, that's not ideal. But if it's a group date, maybe. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings enough, but his intentions are good. \n\nThe answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because the girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special night, and bringing another girl disrupts that. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting her wishes. However, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are positive. \n\nBut generally, in such situations, the person's partner's feelings are important. If the girlfriend is opposed and the author proceeds, that could be considered inconsiderate. So, the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
