With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is: he's 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. His friend, who's 20, didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to take her along, but his girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. Prom is typically a significant event for high school students, and bringing a partner is common. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special night, so she might feel like including someone else is disrespectful or not giving her the attention she expects. On the other hand, the author is motivated by gratitude towards his friend who helped him a lot. \n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. When is it okay to bring someone else along? If the girlfriend clearly expects it to be a two-person event, then adding a third person might not be considered. But the author is in a position where he's trying to make up for something his friend missed. \n\nAlso, the age aspect: he's 17, she's 18. They're both minors, so their relationship is still developing in terms of social norms and expectations. The friend is older and not in a relationship, but that might not matter. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author discussed it at work, then brought it up to his girlfriend. The girlfriend's opposition is valid because she has a right to expect a certain experience. The author's reasoning is about gratitude, but he might not be considering his girlfriend's feelings enough. \n\nIs it about fairness? The friend helped him, but the girlfriend is the one he's in a committed relationship with. The author might be prioritizing his gratitude over his partner's wishes. That could be seen as a conflict of interest. \n\nAlso, prom is usually for the students, so the friend being 20 is a bit outside of that, but maybe they're still allowed. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo the question is: is the author wrong for wanting to do this despite his girlfriend's objection? The answer would depend on whether respecting the girlfriend's wishes takes precedence over his desire to include the friend. Since relationships require mutual respect and communication, not considering the girlfriend's feelings might be seen as wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
