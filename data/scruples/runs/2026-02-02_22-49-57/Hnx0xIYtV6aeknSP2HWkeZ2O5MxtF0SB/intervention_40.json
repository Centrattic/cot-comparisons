With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is 17, their girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. They want to take another girl, their friend who's 20, to prom with them. The friend helped them a lot with social skills and they feel like this is a way to give back because the friend missed her prom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants it to be their special night and be exclusive. Prom is typically a romantic event, so bringing another person might make her feel like it's not just about their relationship. The author's reasoning is based on gratitude and the friend's past, but how does that affect the girlfriend's feelings?\n\nThe friend is important to the author, but the main issue here is whether involving her is respecting the girlfriend's wishes. The girlfriend has a right to feel that her partner should prioritize their relationship on such an occasion. The author might think it's a way to help a friend, but that could come across as not considering the girlfriend's need for a romantic experience.\n\nAlso, the age difference: the friend is 20, which is legal in most places, but the girlfriend is 18. The author is 17, so they're all young and possibly navigating social expectations. However, the core conflict is about respect for the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include a friend. The author's argument is about gratitude, but the girlfriend's argument is about the significance of the event for their relationship.\n\nIn many cases, when a partner has specific expectations, especially about exclusivity in a romantic setting, not honoring that can be seen as a breach of trust or respect. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intentions, but the action could be hurtful. So, the answer might hinge on whether the harm to the girlfriend outweighs the good intention towards the friend.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even though their intentions are good, they're not considering the girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event. The girlfriend's perspective is valid, and the author should prioritize the relationship's dynamics here. So the answer is A.\n"
