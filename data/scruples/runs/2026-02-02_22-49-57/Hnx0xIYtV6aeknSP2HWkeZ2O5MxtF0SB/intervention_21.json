With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The scenario is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20 and missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped the author a lot with social anxiety and improving his social skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night, and the author wants to include the friend as a way of giving back. The key points are the reasons behind the author's request and the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to acknowledge and reciprocate the support he received from his friend. It's a gesture of gratitude. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that prom is a romantic milestone and bringing someone else could compromise that experience. There's a balance between respecting the girlfriend's wishes and honoring the friend's contributions.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around prom. In many cases, prom is seen as a couple's event. Bringing a third person might be unusual and could be perceived as disrespectful to the girlfriend's expectations. However, the author's intentions are positive, but intentions don't always mitigate the impact on the partner's feelings. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the author discuss this with his girlfriend and understand her feelings before making the decision? The scenario mentions they had a conversation where she expressed her opposition. If the girlfriend is clearly against it, the author's insistence could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, even if his reasons are valid.\n\nAlso, the age of the friend (20) and the fact that she's not in a relationship might not be an issue, but it's worth noting. The main issue is the conflict between the couple's desire for a romantic night and the author's desire to include someone important to him.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The author is trying to balance his gratitude towards his friend with his girlfriend's expectations. However, if the girlfriend is upset and the prom is traditionally a couple's event, the author might need to find a compromise, like perhaps attending with the friend at a different event or finding another way to acknowledge her.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the impact, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because his motives are good, but he's not considering the girlfriend's feelings adequately. However, in terms of actions, if he proceeds without her consent, he's being inconsiderate. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be a bit nuanced. But since the options are A or B, likely the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the intention is positive, but there's room for argument either way.\n"
