With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to bring a friend to prom with his girlfriend is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy and his girlfriend have been dating almost a year. He wants to bring his female friend who missed prom due to being hospitalized. His friend helped him socially when he was struggling, and he feels he owes her. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be just the two of them.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The guy's reasoning is about gratitude and wanting to give back. The girlfriend feels it's their special time. But bringing a third person to prom is traditional in some contexts, like a group or with friends. However, prom is typically a couple's event. \n\nThe key points are consent and communication. Did he check with his girlfriend before making plans? It sounds like he discussed it with his friend at work first, which might have come as a surprise to the girlfriend. That could be a misstep. Also, the girlfriend's feelings about it being their night matter. He might not be wrong in wanting to include his friend, but he should have considered her feelings first.\n\nAnother angle: Is the friend attending as a third wheel or as someone who's part of their group? If the friend is joining as a companion for the guy, that might interfere with the girlfriend's expectations. The girlfriend's desire for a romantic night isn't being met if he brings someone else without her input. \n\nBut the guy's intentions are noble\u2014gratitude and helping someone who helped him. The problem might be in the execution rather than the intent. He should have communicated better with his girlfriend to find a compromise, like maybe the friend can attend but not be part of their prom date. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If bringing the friend without her consent and disregarding the girlfriend's feelings counts as being in the wrong, then Answer A. If the intent is good but the communication was lacking, then maybe Answer B. But I think the main issue is not respecting the girlfriend's wishes, so Answer A.\n"
