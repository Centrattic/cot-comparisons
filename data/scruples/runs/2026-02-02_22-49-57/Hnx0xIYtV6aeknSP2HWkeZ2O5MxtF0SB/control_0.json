With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is 18, the author is 17, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20 and missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend was a key part of helping the author with social skills and overcoming anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Prom is typically a formal event where couples go together. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special night and she wants the author to herself. On the other hand, the author feels a sense of gratitude towards his friend and wants to give her a chance to experience prom, which she missed.\n\nThe main issues here are consent and respect for each other's feelings. The author didn't get his girlfriend's approval before considering bringing the friend. While the friend has a good reason for missing prom, including her might make the girlfriend feel excluded or hurt. The author's intention is positive, but actions can have unintended consequences. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because it's a significant event for couples. The author should have communicated his feelings of gratitude first and discussed it with his girlfriend to find a solution that respects both their needs, like maybe attending a different event with the friend or finding a way to include her without compromising the girlfriend's expectations. \n\nSince the author didn't consult his girlfriend beforehand and is now causing conflict, it's possible he's in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, but I need to check if there's a middle ground or if the intentions matter more. However, in relationships, making decisions that affect the partner without discussion is usually frowned upon. So, yes, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
