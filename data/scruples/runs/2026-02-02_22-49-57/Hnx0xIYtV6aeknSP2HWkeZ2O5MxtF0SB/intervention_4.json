With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a 17-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to take another girl (his female friend, 20) with them. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. The friend had missed her prom due to hospitalization, and he feels she helped him a lot with social skills and anxiety.\n\nHmm. First, the key points are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include a friend. The girlfriend feels it should be their special night. The author thinks it's a chance to give back to the friend. But bringing another girl to prom with his girlfriend might be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if it's a friend, it's a couples event. How does this affect the girlfriend's expectations? Trust issues? Maybe the girlfriend feels he's prioritizing someone else over their relationship. The author's justification is gratitude, but relationships often have expectations of exclusivity in certain settings. So, even if the friend is close, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. The author might not be in the wrong in his intention, but the action could be wrong because it disregards his girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event. The answer might be A, yes, he's in the wrong because the girlfriend's perspective is important in a relationship. Even if the friend helped him, taking another girl to a date with his girlfriend isn't typical and could be hurtful. So, B or A? The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but maybe I should consider if the situation is more nuanced. However, in relationships, partners usually expect exclusivity in such events. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
