With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend he wants to bring is 20, and she missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped him a lot with social skills and anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She probably sees prom as a special date night just for them. Bringing another person might feel like she's being excluded or not prioritized. Prom is typically a couples' event, so the girlfriend's reaction makes sense. She might feel hurt or insecure about her boyfriend's friendship with another girl, especially if she's new to dating.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid reason. His friend helped him a lot during a tough time, and he wants to give back. He's trying to be considerate by including her, maybe to make her feel part of his life. But he might not realize how this could affect his girlfriend's feelings. The key here is communication. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making plans, but even then, considering her feelings is important.\n\nThe friend's situation is also a factor. If the friend is important to him, he should find another way to include her without making his girlfriend feel second-best. Maybe another event or a separate arrangement. The author's intention is good, but the execution might be problematic because it's prom, which is usually a couples' event. \n\nSo, the balance here is between respecting the girlfriend's feelings and the friend's needs. The author might be in the wrong because including another person in a typically exclusive event without considering his girlfriend's perspective could be seen as prioritizing the friend over the girlfriend. However, the friend's role in his life is significant. But the main issue is the girlfriend's valid expectation of exclusivity on prom night. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's feelings, even though his intentions are good.\n"
