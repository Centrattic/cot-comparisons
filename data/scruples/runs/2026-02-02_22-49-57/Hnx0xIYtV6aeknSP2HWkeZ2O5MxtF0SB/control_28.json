With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy wants to bring his female friend to prom with him and his girlfriend. The girlfriend is against it because she wants it to be their special night. The guy's reasons are that his friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital, and she helped him a lot with his social skills and anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a big event, especially for high schoolers. She might see it as a night just for the two of them, a way to celebrate their relationship. If her boyfriend wants to bring another girl, that could feel like a betrayal or a way of giving someone else priority over their relationship. She might feel hurt or neglected.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's friend has a valid reason\u2014she missed out on prom and he feels she deserves a chance to experience it. He also acknowledges that she helped him a lot. So he's trying to repay that kindness. But bringing her along with his girlfriend complicates things. It's important to consider if there's a respectful way to include his friend without making his girlfriend feel left out. Maybe he could have explained the situation better, or maybe they could find another way to celebrate with his friend without involving her on prom night.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's feelings are about wanting the night to herself. The guy's action might be seen as not prioritizing their relationship. Even if his intentions are good, the impact on his girlfriend is significant. He might need to find a compromise, like attending prom with his girlfriend and then doing something else with his friend, or maybe attending a different event with his friend. But since he's already asked the friend to join them, it's a bit late for that. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend didn't know about her impact on his social skills might mean that the guy is placing a lot of importance on her, but the girlfriend's feelings are immediate and personal. The girlfriend might feel that her relationship is being overshadowed. \n\nSo, while the guy has a good motive, the way he's handling it might be inconsiderate. He should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier and found a solution that respects both the friend's needs and the girlfriend's feelings. Since he didn't, and the girlfriend is now upset, he might be in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, is there a way to argue he's not? Maybe if he's trying to do something kind for a friend, but it's not necessarily the girlfriend's fault. However, in a relationship, the partner's feelings about such an event are crucial. The guy's actions could be seen as prioritizing the friend over the girlfriend, which is a common source of conflict. So I think the answer leans towards AITA being the guy.\n"
