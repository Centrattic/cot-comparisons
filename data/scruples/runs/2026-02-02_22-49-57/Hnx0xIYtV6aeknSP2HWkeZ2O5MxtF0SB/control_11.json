With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nSo, first, the situation: the guy and his girlfriend have been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, who missed prom because she was in the hospital, to the prom with them. His friend helped him a lot with social skills and he feels grateful. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for them.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the girlfriend's feelings versus the guy's desire to repay his friend. The girlfriend is in a relationship with him, so she might see this as a shared experience. He's considering bringing someone else, which could make her feel like she's not the priority. On the other hand, the friend helped him a lot, and she's important to him. \n\nBut wait, bringing another girl to prom with a girlfriend could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the friend is just coming along, the girlfriend might feel it's a breach of trust or that her partner is prioritizing someone else. Relationships usually involve mutual respect for each other's feelings and boundaries. The boyfriend's intention is to thank his friend, but he's not considering his girlfriend's perspective. \n\nHe says the friend is important, but maybe he should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier? Since they were planning prom together, introducing another person might not have been communicated properly. The girlfriend's main point is that it's their special night, so the boyfriend's action might be seen as disregarding her feelings. \n\nSo, even though his intentions are good, the action could be hurtful. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here. Relationships require considering each other's feelings. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes, even if his motives are good. Alternatively, if the friend is just tagging along and not as a date, maybe it's different. But bringing another girl might still be a red flag for the girlfriend. \n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, partners usually expect to have each other's attention on special events. Including another person might be seen as a violation of that expectation. The boyfriend should communicate better and consider his girlfriend's perspective. So, even if the friend's history is sad, the boyfriend's plan might not be fair to his girlfriend. Hence, he's in the wrong.\n"
