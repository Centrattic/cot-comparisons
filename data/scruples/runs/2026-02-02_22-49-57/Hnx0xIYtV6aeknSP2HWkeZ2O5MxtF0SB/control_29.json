With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA situation. The user is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. They're planning prom, and he wants to bring his female friend who never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night just for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention is to include his friend out of gratitude and to give back, which is a nice sentiment. His friend helped him develop social skills and supported him when he was struggling. So, bringing her along seems like a way to make up for her missing out on prom.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend feels that prom is their special time. It's a common tradition to go as a couple, and she might feel like bringing another person would diminish the significance of the event for them. Her feeling of wanting the night to herself is valid too.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier. If he hadn't, and only brought it up after she had expectations, that could be an issue. But in the scenario, he mentions they talked about prom plans, and then he had a conversation with his friend. It seems like he might not have considered how she would feel until after he decided. \n\nAlso, the age and relationship status matter. They're both teenagers, and prom is a big deal in high school. The girlfriend's perspective might be more about the traditional experience and feeling exclusive. The author's reasoning is altruistic, but the girlfriend's feelings are about their relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to do something kind for a friend, but he might have overlooked his girlfriend's feelings. The question is whether his action is inconsiderate despite his good intentions. If the girlfriend is clear that she wants it to be just the two of them, then bringing another person could be seen as disregarding her wishes. However, if the author explains his reasons and they can find a compromise, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But since the girlfriend is opposed, and he's pushing it, it might mean he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her feelings and the traditional significance of the event for their relationship. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions he's been with his girlfriend for almost a year. That's a solid relationship, so maybe the girlfriend's reaction is more about the exclusivity of the night. The friend has been a significant part of the author's life, so there's a balance between honoring that friendship and respecting the girlfriend's expectations. \n\nIn some cases, bringing a plus-one for a good reason might be acceptable, but it's about how it's communicated. If the author didn't consult his girlfriend first and only told her after making the decision, that's a problem. However, the scenario says they talked about prom plans, but maybe the author didn't mention the friend initially. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings before making the request. If he did and still insisted, then he's in the wrong. If he didn't, then that's a problem. The answer might hinge on communication. Since the girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their night, the author's inclusion of his friend might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the girlfriend's wishes for their special occasion.\n"
