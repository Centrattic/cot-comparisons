With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that he's a 17-year-old guy, in a relationship with his girlfriend for almost a year. They're planning prom, but he also has this female friend who missed her prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to take her along as a way to thank her for helping him with social skills and overcoming anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include his friend. The girlfriend's perspective is that prom is a special night for couples, so she expects it to be just the two of them. The author, on the other hand, sees it as an opportunity to do something nice for a friend who helped him a lot. \n\nI should think about what's typical in prom culture. In some places, prom is strictly a couples-only event, while in others, people might attend with groups. However, the girlfriend might have expected a traditional prom date, so the author's plan could be seen as conflicting with her expectations. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on gratitude and wanting to give back to his friend. But relationships often require considering the partner's feelings. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend might feel hurt or neglected. The key here is whether the author's action respects the girlfriend's expectations. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of communication. The author mentioned that the girlfriend is opposed, so maybe he should have discussed this earlier. But he did talk about it with his friend at work, which led to the idea. However, the girlfriend's reaction shows that she didn't expect this. \n\nAnother angle: the author is 17, so maybe he's still learning about relationship boundaries. The girlfriend is 18, so she's an adult. The friend is 20, so there's a bit of an age difference, but that's not necessarily relevant. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend clearly wants a couples-only prom, and he's insisting on bringing someone else, that could be seen as not respecting her feelings. Even if his intentions are good, the impact on the relationship matters. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong), because he's not considering his girlfriend's perspective and the cultural expectations of prom as a couples event. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if his actions are based on genuine gratitude and he's trying to be kind to a friend. \n\nBut in relationships, compromise is important. The author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more. So perhaps the answer is A. But some might argue that it's not his fault if he didn't realize the cultural significance. But the girlfriend is clear in her objection. So the author's action is causing conflict, which is a red flag. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
