With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 17-year-old guy who's dating an 18-year-old girl. They're planning to go to prom together, but he wants to bring his friend, a 20-year-old woman who never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night, while the author feels he needs to take the friend as a way of giving back to her for helping him when he was struggling socially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that his friend was kind to him and helped him when he was in a tough spot. He wants to do something nice for her, which seems like a noble intention. On the other hand, the girlfriend is the one he's in a relationship with, and she's feeling left out or not prioritized for their special event. Prom is a big deal for many people, so her wanting it to be just the two of them makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key factors here might be the expectations in a relationship and the importance of communication. The author didn't consult his girlfriend about bringing another person right away. Even though his friend is important to him, bringing someone else to a date with his girlfriend could be seen as disregarding her feelings. Relationships often require considering the partner's perspective, especially in a situation that's supposed to be exclusive and special.\n\nAnother point is the age and maturity aspect. Both the author and his girlfriend are young, so their understanding of relationships might still be developing. The friend is older, but that might not directly affect the situation. The main issue is the conflict between the author's desire to reciprocate kindness and respecting his girlfriend's wishes.\n\nI should also think about social norms. Typically, prom is a couple's event. Inviting a third person might not be the norm, and it's possible the girlfriend feels that the author is not honoring the exclusivity of their relationship. However, the author's intentions are good, but maybe he didn't consider how his girlfriend would feel. The fact that he didn't check with her first could be a mistake.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, this isn't a clear-cut legal issue. It's more about social expectations and relationship dynamics. The author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings in this matter. While his intentions are positive, the action of bringing another person without considering her input might be hurtful. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take his girlfriend's feelings into account and acted without discussing it with her properly.\n"
