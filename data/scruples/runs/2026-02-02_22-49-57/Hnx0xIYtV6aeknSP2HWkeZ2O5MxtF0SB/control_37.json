With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The scenario is that the author and his girlfriend are planning prom, but he wants to include his female friend who never went to prom and helped him with social skills.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is 18, the author is 17. They've been dating almost a year. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be special and only for the two of them. The author feels that bringing his friend is a way to give back because she helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety. The friend is 20, which is a bit older, and she missed her prom due to hospitalization.\n\nSo, the girlfriend's perspective is that this is their special night, which is a common expectation. Prom is often seen as a romantic event, so having another person there could make her feel excluded. On the other hand, the author has a valid reason tied to gratitude and friendship. But is it about the right reasons?\n\nWait, the friend's situation is that she never got to attend prom, which the author is trying to fix. But bringing her along as a third wheel to the author's date with his girlfriend could be problematic. The girlfriend's feelings are important here. The author is prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's desire for a private evening. Even if the motivations are good, the impact on the girlfriend might make the author wrong. \n\nAlso, considering the age difference: the friend is 20, which is legally an adult, but the author is 17. However, that's probably not the main issue here. The main issue is whether including the friend is respecting the girlfriend's wishes. The girlfriend is within her rights to expect that her prom night with her boyfriend is not shared with someone else. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's expectations for their special event. The friend's situation is valid, but the way to address it might not involve taking her to prom with his girlfriend. Perhaps suggesting another way to honor her, like a separate event, would be better. So the author's decision is causing conflict where it shouldn't be.\n"
