With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The author is a 17-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 18, and the friend he wants to invite is 20. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital, and he feels she helped him a lot with social skills and anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She might feel that prom is a special time for just the two of them, so adding someone else could make her feel excluded or that the author is not prioritizing their relationship. On the other hand, the author is trying to do something nice for a friend who supported him, which shows gratitude and consideration for her.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here. If the author is bringing another girl, even if it's just as a friend, it might cause jealousy or insecurity in the girlfriend. Relationships often have boundaries, and the author didn't consult his girlfriend about this friend before making the plan. The friend is important, but the girlfriend's feelings about the prom night are also valid.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier to avoid hurt feelings. Since the girlfriend is now opposed, the author needs to consider her feelings and maybe find a compromise, like bringing the friend but ensuring the night is still focused on their relationship. Alternatively, finding another way to celebrate with the friend without involving the prom.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" for wanting to honor his friend, but he didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective in time, leading to conflict. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The answer might be more nuanced, but since the user asked for a yes or no, I need to decide. The author's intentions are good, but the action could be seen as inconsiderate of his girlfriend's wishes. So maybe answer A (yes, in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize his partner's feelings, but some might argue it's a gray area. Hmm.\n"
