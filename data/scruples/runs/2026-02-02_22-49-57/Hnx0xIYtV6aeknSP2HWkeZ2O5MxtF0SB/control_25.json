With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a 17-year-old guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is 18. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring a female friend (20) who never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital. This friend helped him a lot at work when he was struggling with social anxiety and helped him develop social skills. He sees this as a chance to give back to her. His girlfriend is against it because she wants it to be their special night. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that prom is a special night for the two of them, and she wants to be alone with him. On the other hand, the guy feels a strong sense of obligation to his friend because of the support she provided during a tough time. The friend didn't have the chance to go to prom, and he wants to include her as a way to make up for that.\n\nI need to think about whether bringing another person into a date that's supposed to be just between a couple is acceptable. Typically, prom is a traditional event for couples. If the girlfriend is expecting it to be a two-person event, bringing someone else might be seen as a violation of that expectation. However, the guy's intention is to honor his friend's situation and show gratitude. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Did they discuss prom plans together, or is the girlfriend's objection coming up because he introduced the idea of a third person after initial plans? The story mentions that they \"sat down to talk about our plans,\" but then he talked to his friend at work. Maybe the initial plans were for just the two of them, and the girlfriend felt that bringing in the friend was a deviation from that. \n\nThe friend's situation is unique\u2014she missed her prom. The guy wants to include her as a way to give her the experience. But is it fair to his girlfriend? The girlfriend might feel neglected or that her feelings about the event being special for them are being disregarded. \n\nAlso, the age and maturity of the individuals. At 17, the guy might be learning about relationships and boundaries. The girlfriend is 18, so she's an adult. The friend is 20. The guy's reasoning is based on gratitude and a desire to help, which is commendable. However, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If the girlfriend is clearly opposed, then the guy needs to weigh his intentions against her feelings.\n\nIt's possible that the guy isn't in the wrong because his intentions are good, but he might need to find another way to honor his friend without compromising the girlfriend's expectations. Alternatively, if the girlfriend feels that her needs in the relationship are being sidelined, then the guy might be in the wrong.\n\nAnother point: the girlfriend might have the right to expect that a prom date is for her and her partner. The guy's action might be seen as not respecting her wishes. Even if it's a kind gesture to the friend, the girlfriend's feelings are important. \n\nIn conclusion, while the guy's intentions are noble, the girlfriend's feelings about the event being their special night might take precedence. The author could be in the wrong for not considering her perspective more in the planning phase.\n"
