With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend who have been dating almost a year. The boyfriend wants to include his friend, who he feels helped him a lot, but the girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The boyfriend feels that including his friend is a way to give back for the support he received. His friend missed out on prom due to hospitalization, so he sees this as an opportunity for her. On the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she expects prom to be an exclusive, intimate event between the two of them. She might feel neglected or that her feelings aren't being respected.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. Prom is typically a significant event for couples, often seen as a milestone. The girlfriend's expectation might be based on the idea that it's their time together. However, the boyfriend's intention is rooted in gratitude and wanting to do something nice for a friend who helped him. There's a balance between honoring personal relationships and respecting a partner's feelings.\n\nIs the boyfriend in the wrong? Well, the key points are communication and mutual respect. If the boyfriend had discussed this with his girlfriend earlier and explained his reasoning, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since the girlfriend is already opposed, forcing it might hurt her feelings. However, the boyfriend's action isn't inherently wrong; he's trying to be kind to a friend. The issue is more about how he approached it and whether he considered his girlfriend's feelings in a timely manner.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The girlfriend's desire for a special night is valid, but the boyfriend's gratitude towards his friend is also understandable. The problem arises when one person's needs aren't communicated or respected. So, the boyfriend might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better by addressing his girlfriend's concerns and finding a solution that satisfies both parties, like maybe a separate arrangement for the friend instead of a three-way prom attendance.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might lean towards the boyfriend not being in the wrong (B) because his intentions are good, but it's important to note that better communication could have prevented the conflict. However, depending on cultural norms and expectations around prom, there might be arguments either way. The main takeaway is that both sides have valid points, but the boyfriend's intentions are not malicious.\n"
