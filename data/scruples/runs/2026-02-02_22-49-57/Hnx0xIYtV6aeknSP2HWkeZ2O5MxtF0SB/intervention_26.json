With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wanting to take another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring his close female friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot with social skills when he was struggling with anxiety. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special and just for the two of them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationship dynamics and the reasoning behind the author's request. The girlfriend's perspective is about the exclusivity of the prom night as a couple. The author's justification is based on gratitude and the friend's situation.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for wanting to include his friend. From an ethical standpoint, it's about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus fulfilling a personal obligation to a friend. The girlfriend might feel that the prom is a significant milestone meant for couples, so having another person could undermine that. However, the author argues it's also a way to give back to a friend who did a lot for him.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid because her perspective is that it's their special night. The author's intentions are good, but he might not have considered how this affects his partner's emotional needs. The fact that the friend never had a prom could be a mitigating factor, but the girlfriend's feelings might still be hurt regardless.\n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions are rooted in gratitude and kindness. However, the act of going against his partner's wishes could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The answer hinges on whether the action is considered disrespectful to the girlfriend's boundaries. If the girlfriend had clear expectations, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the friend's situation is compelling and the author tried to explain and compromise, maybe not.\n\nIn many similar cases, the girlfriend's feelings often take precedence because the event is a couple's milestone. However, the author's explanation adds context that could be seen as a valid reason. The final call depends on balancing respect for the partner's wishes against the moral obligation to a friend. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that relationships require mutual respect and understanding, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a strong case for A (Yes) if the girlfriend's feelings are prioritized. However, given the detailed reasoning and the friend's significant role in his life, maybe B is the right answer.\n"
