With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation involves a boyfriend (17M) and girlfriend (18F) who have been dating almost a year. The boyfriend wants to invite his friend (20F) to prom with them because the friend never went to prom and helped him a lot. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The boyfriend's reasoning is based on gratitude and wanting to give back to a friend who supported him. The girlfriend feels it should be their special time. The main issue is whether including the friend is wrong.\n\nI should consider social norms. Typically, prom is a romantic event, so bringing someone else might be seen as inappropriate. But the boyfriend's intention is altruistic. However, relationships often require considering each other's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she might feel it's their night. The boyfriend didn't consult her before making the decision, which could be a problem. He mentions they talked about plans, but maybe he didn't communicate this friend's situation properly. \n\nAlso, the friend's age is 20, so there's an age difference with the girlfriend (18). The girlfriend might feel uncomfortable or think it's inappropriate. The boyfriend's friend is important to him, but the girlfriend's feelings need to be considered as well. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the friend can attend separately, but not as a group. The boyfriend's approach might be selfish if he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings. Even if his intentions are good, he might be in the wrong because he didn't respect her wishes first. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's action could be seen as inconsiderate of his girlfriend's perspective. The gratitude is valid, but he should have discussed this idea with his girlfriend before making plans. Since he's already made plans to include the friend without her consent, that's where the problem lies. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a way his action isn't wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's not his fault if he's trying to be kind. But in relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's feelings are important, so he might be in the wrong for not discussing it thoroughly. So I think the answer is A.\n"
