With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with their girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is 17 and 18 years old, so they're teenagers. They've been dating for almost a year. Prom is a big event, and the guy wants to take another friend, a girl who's important to him because she helped him when he was struggling with social anxiety. His girlfriend doesn't want to share him and feels it's their special night. \n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy's intentions are to give back to a friend who supported him. That's a good motive. But his girlfriend feels it's a personal event. In relationships, there can be expectations about exclusivity, especially in a formal event like prom. The girlfriend might feel left out or that her feelings aren't respected by bringing someone else. \n\nBut on the other hand, the guy is trying to acknowledge someone who helped him. Maybe the girlfriend feels possessive, which isn't uncommon in relationships. The key here is whether the guy's action is inconsiderate. He's not trying to be disrespectful to his girlfriend but is showing gratitude to a friend. \n\nHowever, bringing a third person to a couples' event might not be the best approach. It could create discomfort for the girlfriend and the friend. Maybe there's a way to honor the friend without including her in the prom night, like doing something else together. \n\nThe guy might not be in the wrong because his intention is positive, but he should consider his girlfriend's feelings more. It's a balance between personal relationships and the relationship with his girlfriend. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how the couple previously communicated about such events. Since they haven't resolved it, the guy might need to find a compromise instead of insisting. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are good, but he needs to communicate better with his girlfriend. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the act of bringing another person is inherently disrespectful to the girlfriend's feelings. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the question is about if he's in the wrong, and his intention was to give back, not to slight his girlfriend, maybe B is the answer.\n"
