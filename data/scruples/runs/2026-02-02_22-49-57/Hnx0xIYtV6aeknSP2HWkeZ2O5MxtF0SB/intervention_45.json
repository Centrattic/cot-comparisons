With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend and himself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is a guy (17 M) in a relationship with an 18-year-old girl. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring his female friend (20 F) because she missed her prom when she was in the hospital. This friend was really supportive to him when he was struggling with social anxiety and helped him improve. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night and doesn't want anyone else there.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether inviting the friend is wrong. The author argues that it's a way to give back to someone who helped him, while the girlfriend feels it's their night and wants exclusivity.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is trying to honor a friend's contribution to his life, which seems like a noble intention. The friend didn't have a prom, and this could be a way to make up for that. On the other hand, the girlfriend is in a committed relationship and might feel that prom, being a significant event, should be exclusive to the couple. She might feel that bringing another girl undermines the romantic significance of the event.\n\nBut here's the thing: prom is a social event, and it's not uncommon for people to attend with groups of friends, even if they're not in a relationship. The key question is whether the author is being respectful of his partner's feelings. If he's planning to go with his friend as a separate couple, that might be different, but the scenario here is a group of three. However, the girlfriend might interpret this as him prioritizing his friendship over their relationship, especially since prom is often seen as a milestone for couples.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of communication. The author mentioned they had discussions about prom plans, and the girlfriend expressed her opposition. If he goes ahead despite her feelings, that could be seen as dismissive. However, if he's trying to find a compromise\u2014like maybe attending the prom with his girlfriend and then meeting the friend afterward for a different part of the event\u2014that might be a middle ground. But the way the question is phrased, it seems like he's insisting on bringing her, which might be the issue.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's feelings. The friend never had a prom, so it's understandable the author wants to do something for her. But is the friend okay with being part of a trio? What are her expectations? If she's fine with it, maybe it's more about the couple's dynamic.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance individual needs with the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's desire for a special night is valid. If the author is insistent without considering her perspective, that could be problematic. But if he's trying to find a way to honor both his partner's wishes and his friend's situation, there might be a solution. However, the way the question is framed, the author is choosing to bring the friend despite the girlfriend's objections, which might make him at fault for not respecting her feelings.\n\nBut maybe the author isn't necessarily wrong. Prom is a school event, and sometimes people attend with larger groups. If he's not leading the friend on (i.e., not suggesting a romantic relationship between them) and the girlfriend is still upset, maybe the issue is more about expectations. The girlfriend might need reassurance that the author's intentions are purely to include a friend, not to prioritize the friend over the relationship.\n\nIn summary, the answer could be either A or B depending on how the situation is handled. If the author is being considerate and the girlfriend still feels hurt, maybe there's a communication issue. But if the author is ignoring her feelings and being insensitive, that's a problem. The key factors are respect for the girlfriend's feelings, the friend's intentions, and whether the author is being fair in his decision.\n"
