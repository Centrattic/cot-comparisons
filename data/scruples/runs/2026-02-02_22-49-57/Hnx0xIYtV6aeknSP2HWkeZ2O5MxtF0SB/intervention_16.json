With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. His friend, a girl who's important to him, didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to take her along as a way to give back for her support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants the prom to be their special night and feels he should be with her alone. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might see prom as a significant milestone and a time for just the two of them. She might feel hurt or unappreciated if he brings someone else.\n\nOn the author's side, his friend helped him a lot with social skills and through tough times. He feels a sense of gratitude and wants to include her as a way to show appreciation. His reasoning is about giving back and recognizing her impact on his life. That's understandable, especially if the friend has been a key support figure.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Prom is often seen as a couple's event, so adding someone else could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. However, the author's intention is positive\u2014he's not trying to sabotage the relationship but to acknowledge someone important. The problem here is balancing the girlfriend's expectations with his desire to honor his friend.\n\nPossible angles to consider: communication. Did the author and girlfriend discuss this beforehand? The author mentioned they talked about plans, but maybe the girlfriend wasn't included in the conversation about the friend. Also, the girlfriend might feel that the friend is being prioritized over her, which could strain the relationship. The author's friend might not even be aware of the significance of the gesture, which could lead to unintended consequences.\n\nIs there a compromise? Maybe the author could find another way to honor the friend without including her in prom. But since he's set on bringing her, the conflict remains. The question is whether his actions are wrong. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable and the author ignores her feelings, then he's in the wrong. But if he's making an effort to explain his reasons and both are trying to find a middle ground, it's more nuanced.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, prom is typically a couple's event. However, personal relationships and individual circumstances vary. The author's situation has valid reasons, but the girlfriend's feelings can't be dismissed either. So, the answer might depend on whether the author is being considerate of both perspectives. If he's pushing for it without considering her feelings, then AITA. If he's trying to balance both, maybe not. But since the girlfriend is opposed and he still wants to do it, it's leaning towards him being in the wrong. But maybe not completely, because his intent is positive. Hmm.\n"
