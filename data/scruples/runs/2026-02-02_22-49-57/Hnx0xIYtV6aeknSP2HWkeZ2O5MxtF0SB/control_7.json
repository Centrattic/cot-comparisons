With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The author is a 17-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. He wants to bring his female friend, who never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital. She's 20, and she's been a big help to him at work, especially with his social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to do something kind for his friend, which is commendable. He mentions that the friend helped him a lot and he wants to give back. On the other hand, his girlfriend feels left out and wants the night to be just the two of them. \n\nBut wait, bringing a third person to prom is a big deal. Prom is typically a couples' event. Even if the friend is just another girl, the girlfriend might see it as a betrayal or a lack of consideration for their relationship. The author might not realize how important this night is for his girlfriend. Also, there's the aspect of consent. The girlfriend didn't agree to this, and it's her feelings that are hurt here. \n\nBut then again, the author's intentions are good. He's trying to be a good friend. However, relationships often require putting the other person's feelings first. Maybe he should have discussed this with his girlfriend before even considering it. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's the one in a romantic relationship with him and expects exclusivity in such events. \n\nAnother angle: the friend is 20, which is legal in some places, but age isn't the main issue here. The main issue is the girlfriend's feelings. The author might be prioritizing friendship over his romantic relationship's expectations. That could be seen as a mistake. \n\nAlso, the friend not knowing about her impact on the author's progress might mean she's unaware of how much she's helped, but that's not relevant to the current situation. The problem is the conflict between the two relationships.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more. Since the girlfriend is upset and this is a significant event in their relationship, the author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing her feelings. Even if his intentions are good, the action is causing harm. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
