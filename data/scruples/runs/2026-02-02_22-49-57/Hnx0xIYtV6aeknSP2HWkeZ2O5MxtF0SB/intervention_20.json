With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The author is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. His friend, a female who's important to him, didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to take her along as a way to give back for all the support she's given him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's saying that prom should be their special night, and she wants him to herself. That makes sense because prom is traditionally a significant event for couples. It's meant to be a private celebration with the person they're dating. Bringing another girl might make her feel excluded or not prioritized.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that this friend is very important to him. The friend helped him through social anxiety and building social skills, which is a big deal. He sees this as a chance to repay her kindness. His reasoning is about gratitude and giving back, which is a valid emotion. But does that outweigh his girlfriend's feelings?\n\nI should also think about how to balance both relationships. The author is trying to maintain his friendship and his romantic relationship. But maybe he didn't communicate well enough with his girlfriend about the significance of the friend. If they had discussed it and the girlfriend still felt opposed, then the author might need to respect her wishes. However, in the scenario, the girlfriend is opposed because she wants the night for themselves.\n\nAnother angle: Is there a way to include the friend without making the girlfriend feel like the third wheel? Maybe the friend could have her own date or attend separately? But the author wants to take her with them, which implies all three going together. That might not be ideal for the girlfriend.\n\nAlso, considering the social norm of prom as a couple event. While it's okay to have friends, adding a third person might complicate things. The girlfriend's perspective is about wanting the night to be just the two of them. The author's intention is noble, but the action might not be considerate of the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author has valid reasons for wanting to include his friend, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important. If he went ahead without considering her feelings, that might make him at fault. But if he tried to explain his reasons and the girlfriend still refused, then the author might not be wrong for standing by his decision. However, since the girlfriend is opposed, maybe the author should prioritize their relationship, especially since they're in a committed partnership for an anniversary event. The answer might depend on whether he communicated and tried to find a compromise. If he didn't and insisted on bringing the friend, then he's more at fault. But the story doesn't mention if he tried to find a middle ground. \n\nIn the original question, the author is asking if he's in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to decide. The key factors are the girlfriend's feelings being hurt and the author's intention to show gratitude. Since the girlfriend is in the relationship and the event is a couple's event, maybe the author should have considered her feelings more. So, answer A (yes, in the wrong) might be the case. But if he had a good reason and communicated it, maybe not. However, the girlfriend's opposition is strong, so maybe answer A is more correct.\n"
