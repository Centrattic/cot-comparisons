With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy (17 M) wants to bring his friend (20 F) to prom with him and his girlfriend (18 F). The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. The guy's reasoning is that his friend never went to prom and was a big help to him when he was struggling socially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the author and his girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year, which is a significant relationship. Prom is a big event, often seen as a milestone where couples want to share it. The girlfriend's concern about it being their special night makes sense from her perspective. She might feel that bringing another person would take away from their time together.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid point about his friend. The friend helped him a lot, especially with social anxiety, and this could be a way to give back. The friend's situation\u2014never having a prom due to hospitalization\u2014is also a factor. The author is looking to include someone who's important in his life, which is commendable.\n\nBut here's the conflict: the girlfriend's feelings versus the friend's needs. The key here is communication. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier. When he brought it up, she was opposed. The question is whether his reasons override her feelings. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, prom is often considered a special event for couples. Including a third person might be seen as disrespectful or not considering the girlfriend's emotional needs. However, the author's intentions are good, and he's trying to honor someone who helped him. \n\nBut I think the main issue is the lack of mutual agreement. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should consider her perspective. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend might feel neglected or that her wishes aren't being respected. The author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's desire for a private night, which is a significant event in their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't fully consider his girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event, even though his intentions are understandable.\n"
