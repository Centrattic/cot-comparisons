With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to take his friend who missed her prom. The friend is a girl, 20, who helped him a lot with social skills and during a tough time. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether inviting the friend is wrong. The girlfriend feels left out and wants the event to be exclusive. The author feels it's a way to repay the friend for her support.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and expectations. Prom is often seen as a couple's event, but it's not a strict rule. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The author didn't keep this a secret; he discussed it with his girlfriend. However, the girlfriend is upset, which is valid because she might feel that her partner is prioritizing someone else over their relationship.\n\nThe author's intentions are good\u2014he wants to honor the friend's situation and show gratitude. But in a relationship, both partners' feelings matter. Even if the intention is good, the girlfriend's perspective needs to be considered. Prom is a big deal for many people, and expecting it to be their special night is understandable. The author might not have considered how this would affect her feelings.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, it's a matter of balancing individual intentions with the relationship's dynamics. If he didn't communicate properly or dismissed her feelings, that could be problematic. But here, he did talk to her. However, the fact that she's hurt suggests that he might not have fully anticipated her feelings. It's possible he's being considerate to a friend but not enough to his girlfriend. \n\nIn some perspectives, bringing a close friend might be seen as a kind gesture. But in a relationship, partners might expect exclusivity in certain events. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of that expectation. However, if the friend is being invited as a third person and not as a date, that's different. But the question is whether it's wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the author might need to find a compromise, like attending separately with the friend in a different way. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author's action could be seen as disregarding their relationship's expectations. But others might say he's not in the wrong because he's being considerate to a friend. It's a bit of a grey area. Given the context, the girlfriend's hurt feelings indicate that the author might be in the wrong by not fully considering the impact on their relationship.\n"
