With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20 and missed her prom due to hospitalization. The author's friend helped him a lot with social anxiety and job integration. He wants to include her as a gesture of gratitude.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to include his friend despite his girlfriend's objections.\n\nHmm. Prom is a significant event, typically a date night. Bringing someone else could be seen as a breach of trust or disrespect to the girlfriend. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The author might not realize that including another girl could make his girlfriend feel like he's prioritizing his friendship over their relationship. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's intention is to repay his friend for her support. There's a genuine desire to do good here. However, relationships often require considering both partners' perspectives. The girlfriend's perspective is valid\u2014prom is usually a couple's event. The author might need to communicate better and find a compromise, like attending with the friend at a different event or explaining the significance more thoroughly.\n\nBut the core issue is whether it's wrong. Prom is a private event for couples. Bringing someone else without the partner's consent could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's objection is about having the author to herself. The author's reasoning is noble, but respect for the girlfriend's feelings is crucial. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's disregarding her feelings for his friend's benefit, even with good intentions.\n"
