With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: He's 17, his girlfriend is 18, dating for almost a year. He wants to bring his female friend to prom with them because she missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped him a lot, and he wants to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special for the two of them.\n\nSo, the main conflict is between the guy's desire to include his friend and the girlfriend's expectation of exclusivity on prom night. \n\nI need to consider relationship norms. Prom is a big deal, often seen as a couple's event. Bringing another person might be perceived as disrespectful to the girlfriend, especially if it wasn't discussed or agreed upon. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here; she might feel that the night is supposed to be about their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's argument is that the friend helped him a lot. But even if that's true, prom is a social event, but it's also a private moment between the couple. Including someone else without the partner's consent could be seen as not considering her feelings enough. The girlfriend's objection is about wanting the night to be special for them, which is a common expectation in such events.\n\nThe guy's reasoning is about gratitude, but the way to show gratitude doesn't necessarily involve including the friend in a significant couple event. Maybe there are other ways to help the friend, like attending a different event or giving her a gift. \n\nThe key point here is that the girlfriend's feelings were not considered in the initial plan. The guy didn't consult her before making the suggestion, which could be seen as dismissive of her wishes. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend is against it, the guy should consider her perspective. \n\nSo, even though the intentions are good, the action of wanting to bring the friend might be inconsiderate of the girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
