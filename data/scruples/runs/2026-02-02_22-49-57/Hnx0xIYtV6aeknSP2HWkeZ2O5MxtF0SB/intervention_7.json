With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: the person is 17, male, in a relationship with an 18-year-old girlfriend for almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring a close female friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and social skills. The girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night and doesn't want to share him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author's intentions are to give back to his friend who supported him. The friend's situation is valid\u2014she missed her prom. The author feels this is a way to show gratitude. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels it's their special time and wants exclusivity. \n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong. Relationships often involve balancing individual needs with the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is about wanting a private, intimate event, which is understandable. Prom is a significant milestone often seen as a couple's event. Including another girl might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized, which could lead to hurt feelings or a sense of being disregarded. \n\nHowever, the author's friend is important to him and has a legitimate reason for not attending prom before. The author's motivation is to show appreciation, which is a noble intent. But the crux is whether this action respects the girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event.\n\nI should also consider communication. The author discussed prom plans with his girlfriend, so he should have mentioned the friend's situation earlier. Maybe if he had explained the reasons more clearly or considered an alternative, like a separate gesture for his friend, he might have found a middle ground. However, the problem arises from the conflict between his desire to honor his friend and his girlfriend's expectations for the evening.\n\nIn many relationships, the assumption is that major events like prom are for the couple. Bringing another person might be seen as a breach of that unspoken agreement, especially if the other person is a close friend. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling that the author isn't prioritizing her. Even if the author's intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author might need to consider that his actions, regardless of intent, could be hurtful.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes in relationships, partners expect certain events to be exclusive. If the author had not discussed this with his girlfriend before finalizing plans, that could be a problem. But he did talk about prom plans with her, and the friend's involvement came up later. The key issue is whether the author should have anticipated his girlfriend's feelings and found a way to honor his friend without including her in the prom event.\n\nMaybe the author could have done something else for his friend, like taking her out separately or giving a gift, instead of bringing her to prom. Since prom is a couple's event, including another person might not be appropriate, regardless of the reason. The friend's absence from her own prom is unfortunate, but the author's solution might not be the right one in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the action of including his friend in prom could be seen as disregarding his girlfriend's wishes and the traditional nature of the event. The author is in the wrong because he didn't consider how this would affect his girlfriend's feelings and expectations for their special night together.\n"
