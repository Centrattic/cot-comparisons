With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the main points: The guy and his girlfriend (18 and 17) have been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend (20 F) to prom with them because the friend missed out on prom due to hospitalization. The friend was a key support in his life when he started the job, helping him build social skills. The girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The man's reasoning is that he wants to give back to his friend who helped him a lot. The friend's situation is valid\u2014missing prom because of being in the hospital. But the girlfriend feels it's their special night and wants exclusivity. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author did talk to his girlfriend, but she's not okay with it. Even if his intentions are good, bringing another person could make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. Prom is often seen as a couple's event, so her feeling that it's their night is understandable. \n\nHowever, the man's friend's needs are also legitimate. He's trying to do something kind, which is a positive trait. But he needs to balance his friend's needs against his girlfriend's feelings. Maybe there's a compromise, like attending a different event with the friend or finding another way to include her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether his action is wrong. The act of wanting to include his friend isn't inherently wrong, but not respecting his girlfriend's feelings could be. The key is whether he's being considerate of her perspective. If he's prioritizing his friend's needs over his significant other's feelings without finding a middle ground, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention any previous agreements about prom. The girlfriend's opposition is based on wanting a special night. The man's reasons are good, but in a relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. So while his intentions are good, the situation might require more compromise. The answer could lean towards AITA being more on the man's side because he's disregarding his girlfriend's feelings for his friend's benefit, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
