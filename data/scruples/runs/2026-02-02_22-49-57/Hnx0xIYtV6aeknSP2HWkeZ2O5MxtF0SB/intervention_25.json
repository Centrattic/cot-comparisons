With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author (17M) and his girlfriend (18F) are dating for a year. The author's friend (20F) missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend was very supportive when the author was struggling with social anxiety, and he feels he should repay her kindness by taking her to prom as a group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Prom is typically a special event for couples. The girlfriend's perspective is that it should be a private night for just the two of them. The author, on the other hand, sees this as an opportunity to thank his friend. The key points are the intention behind the request and how it affects the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on gratitude and wanting to do something nice for a friend who helped him through a tough time. That's a valid point. However, the girlfriend's objection is about the night being their special time. Relationships often require compromise. The author is suggesting a third person joins, which could be seen as a breach of the couple's private moment, even if the intentions are good.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't trying to replace the girlfriend or be disloyal. He's trying to include someone who's been important in his life. The problem might be more about communication. Maybe the author didn't consider how the girlfriend would feel about it. He could have discussed it more carefully, explaining the significance of including his friend and being open to her feelings. The girlfriend's feeling of wanting the night for just the two of them is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions are respectful of the girlfriend's feelings. If he's not considering her perspective and is pushing his own agenda without compromise, that could be wrong. But if he's trying to find a solution that honors both the friend's needs and the girlfriend's desire for a special night, maybe not. However, the girlfriend is clearly opposed, so the author might need to respect her wishes. \n\nIn many relationships, the partner's comfort and feelings are prioritized. The author's friend situation is important, but the girlfriend's desire for a romantic evening is also significant. The author might need to find an alternative way to thank his friend without compromising the girlfriend's experience. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the girlfriend's feelings in this case, even with good intentions.\n"
