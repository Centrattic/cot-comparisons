With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 17 and their girlfriend is 18. They've been dating a year. The friend in question is 20 and missed her prom due to hospitalization. The author feels this friend helped them a lot, improving their social skills and supporting them through social anxiety. They want to include her in prom as a way to give back.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night, with just the two of them. The author is trying to balance their feelings for their girlfriend with their gratitude towards the friend.\n\nNow, considering relationships and trust. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. The author did talk to their girlfriend, but she's not happy. The question is whether the author's action is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid reason\u2014wanting to thank a friend who helped them a lot. The friend's situation (missing prom) is a factor too. On the other hand, prom is a traditional \"couple event,\" and the girlfriend might feel excluded or that her feelings aren't being considered.\n\nEthically, the author might not be in the wrong because their intention is positive. But in a relationship, the partner's feelings also matter. The problem here is not just the action but how it affects the girlfriend. If the author goes ahead without resolving the conflict, that could be problematic. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which might relate to whether the desire itself is wrong.\n\nAnother angle: is the author being disloyal? The friend is a close friend, not a romantic interest. The author isn't cheating or being unfaithful. But bringing a third person to a romantic event might be seen as a breach of trust or expectation. However, the girlfriend's expectation might be based on traditional norms rather than the author's specific circumstances.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's perspective: she might feel that the author is prioritizing a friendship over their relationship. The author needs to consider whether the friend's inclusion is necessary or if there's a way to honor the friend without ruining the girlfriend's special night. Maybe the author could take the friend to another event, like a dinner or a different party, instead of the prom itself.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention is good, but the execution could be problematic if it's not done with the girlfriend's input and mutual agreement. Since the author is considering the girlfriend's feelings but still wants to proceed, it's a conflict of values. In such cases, the wrong isn't clear-cut. However, since the author is trying to be considerate of both parties, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The main issue is whether they should go through with it despite the girlfriend's objection, which is a separate question from being in the wrong.\n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their intention is to reciprocate kindness, but they need to handle the situation carefully to respect their girlfriend's feelings. The answer might be B, No.\n"
