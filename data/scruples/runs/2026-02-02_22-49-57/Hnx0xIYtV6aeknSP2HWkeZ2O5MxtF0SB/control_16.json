With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to bring a female friend (20) who missed her prom due to hospitalization. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special and just for them. The author believes he's giving back to a friend who helped him a lot, especially with social anxiety. \n\nSo the key points here are: Is it wrong to include a friend in a date night? The girlfriend might feel that prom is a special event meant for couples, so adding someone else could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of her feelings. On the other hand, the author has a valid reason\u2014helping a friend who's important to him. \n\nBut let's consider relationships. Prom is traditionally a couple's event. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special night. By bringing another girl, the author might be causing her insecurity or making her feel less prioritized. Even if his intentions are good, he's not considering her feelings. \n\nAlso, bringing another girl could lead to awkwardness or jealousy. The girlfriend's opposition is valid because she has a right to feel that her partner should be present for her. The author should have discussed this earlier and maybe found another way to honor his friend without involving the prom. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have suggested another event for the friend, like a separate prom-related activity. By insisting on bringing her to the same event, he's placing his friend's needs against his girlfriend's, which isn't fair. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author didn't mention if they've tried to find a solution that satisfies both. If the girlfriend is against it, he should respect her wishes unless there's a way to still support his friend without compromising her comfort. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings for his friend's sake. Even with good intentions, he's neglecting the expectations and emotions of his partner. The girlfriend's desire for a private night is valid, and the author should adjust his plans to respect that.\n"
