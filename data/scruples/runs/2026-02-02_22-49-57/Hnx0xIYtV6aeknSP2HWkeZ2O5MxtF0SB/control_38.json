With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So, the situation is that the guy (17M) and his girlfriend (18F) are planning prom. He has a friend (20F) who missed her prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to take this friend as well, but his girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be just the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's intentions. The girlfriend is in a committed relationship and might view the prom as a romantic, exclusive event. The author's friend is important to him because she helped him socially and with his anxiety. He wants to include her as a way of giving back.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, partners usually expect exclusivity in such events. Bringing someone else could be seen as disregarding the girlfriend's feelings. The author's reasoning is noble\u2014helping a friend\u2014but the girlfriend's perspective is about the significance of the event as their special night. \n\nI need to weigh the intentions versus the impact. The author's intent is to be kind to his friend, but the consequence might be making his girlfriend feel unimportant or hurt. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might feel that the prom is a time for just the two of them. The author might not realize how significant this event is to her, especially in a relationship context.\n\nAlso, the friend is not part of their relationship, so inviting someone else to a couple's event can be seen as overstepping. Even if the friend is a good person, the act of including her in a romantic setting might not be appropriate. The author should consider his girlfriend's feelings first and find another way to support his friend, maybe by doing something else together. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friend's needs in a way that conflicts with his girlfriend's emotional needs and the expectations of their relationship. He should have discussed this more carefully and found a compromise, but the act of bringing someone else to a couple's event is generally seen as inappropriate.\n"
