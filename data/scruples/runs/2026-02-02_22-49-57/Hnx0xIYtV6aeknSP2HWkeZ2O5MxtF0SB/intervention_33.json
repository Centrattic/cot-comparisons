With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring his female friend (20) because she missed her prom due to hospitalization. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. The guy feels he owes this to his friend for helping him with social skills and overcoming anxiety.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the girlfriend's feelings versus the guy's intentions. The girlfriend feels it should be their night, which is understandable. Prom is often seen as a romantic event. The guy's reasoning is about gratitude towards his friend, but inviting a third person could be seen as disrespectful to his girlfriend's wishes.\n\nBut wait, is the guy in the wrong? Let's think. Is there a social norm that prom is strictly a couple's event? In some schools, prom is a couple's thing, but others might have group dances. The guy's intention is to include his friend who missed out, but the girlfriend's perspective is about their special time together. The guy might not have considered that inviting someone else could make his girlfriend feel less prioritized, even if his motives are good.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is 18, so she's an adult, but they're both teenagers in a relationship. The guy's argument is about gratitude, but relationships often require compromise. If he had discussed this with his girlfriend earlier and maybe compromised, maybe the situation would be different. Since the girlfriend is already opposed, he's choosing between her feelings and his friend's, but without a clear solution. \n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of mutual consideration. The guy might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for the event they were planning together. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But maybe not, if the friend's situation is exceptional. However, in the context of a relationship, the girlfriend's comfort and the couple's time should be a priority. So probably A.\n"
