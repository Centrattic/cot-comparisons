With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a 17-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with his girlfriend, who is 18. They're planning prom, but he wants to invite his female friend, 20, who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. This friend helped him a lot when he had social anxiety, so he feels indebted and wants to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be just the two of them.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\n1. **Intentions vs. Impact**: The author's intention seems genuine\u2014he wants to repay his friend for helping him. But bringing another girl to prom with his girlfriend could make her feel neglected or unimportant. Relationships often require considering each other's feelings, even if the intent is good.\n\n2. **Communication**: The author and his girlfriend have different expectations for prom. The girlfriend wants a private, special night, while he wants to include someone else. How have they communicated this? If the author didn't discuss it with his girlfriend first and only told her after, that's a problem. But in the post, he mentions they \"sat down to talk about our plans,\" so maybe he did discuss it, but there was a disagreement.\n\n3. **Respecting Boundaries**: In a relationship, there are unspoken and spoken boundaries. Bringing another person (especially a close friend of the opposite sex) to a traditionally romantic event like prom might cross a boundary his girlfriend has. Even if the friend is just a friend, the girlfriend's feelings matter. \n\n4. **Alternatives**: The author could look for other ways to thank his friend without involving her in a date-oriented event. Maybe a different activity or a gift. Prom is typically a couples' event, so bringing someone else might not be the best idea.\n\n5. **Social Norms and Expectations**: Prom is usually a milestone for couples. Including another person might be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend's wishes and the norms of the event. \n\nConsidering all this, while the author's motives are good, the action might be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings and the nature of the event. The girlfriend's desire for a special night is valid. The author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her feelings and the typical expectations of prom, even with good intentions. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
