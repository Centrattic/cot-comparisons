With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy wants to take another girl to prom with his girlfriend. He explains that this friend helped him a lot, especially with social anxiety and getting through tough times. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be just the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy's girlfriend is 18, and he's 17. They've been dating almost a year. That's a significant relationship. Prom is a big event for many teens, often seen as a special time for couples. The girlfriend's perspective is that this should be their night, so her feeling hurt makes sense. She might feel that bringing another girl, even a close friend, undermines the importance of the night for their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy argues that this friend helped him a lot. He mentions that she was the first to talk to him at work, helped him through social anxiety, and he's trying to give back by including her. His intention seems to be gratitude and wanting to make her happy.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the intention is good, including another girl might not consider his girlfriend's feelings. Relationships require considering each other's needs and boundaries. The girlfriend clearly expressed her desire for the night to be special for them. The guy's response is about his reasons, but he's not addressing her feelings directly. It's possible he's prioritizing his friendship over his partner's emotional needs in this context.\n\nAlso, the idea of bringing someone else to a prom that's traditionally a couple's event might not be standard. Prom is usually about the couple experiencing it together. So the girlfriend's expectation is reasonable. The guy's plan could be seen as not respecting that tradition or her wishes. Even if the friend missed her own prom, there might be other ways to celebrate her without involving the couple time.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the friend isn't in a position to be brought along by the guy in that way. The friend didn't miss her own prom because of his actions, so the responsibility to include her isn't his. Plus, the friend's history with the hospital might make her sensitive to such invitations, but the guy's taking it upon himself to include her without considering the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nIn terms of communication, the guy should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier. They sat down to talk about prom plans, but he might have introduced this idea later when she already had her plans in mind. If he had considered her feelings first, maybe he would have found a different way to honor his friend without conflicting with their plans.\n\nSo, while the guy's intentions are noble, the action might be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings. Relationships often involve compromise, and this situation seems like a conflict where the girlfriend's needs are being overlooked. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his girlfriend's wishes for their special night.\n"
