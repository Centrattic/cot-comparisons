With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl with his girlfriend to prom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. The issue is he wants to bring his female friend, who's 20, to prom with them. His friend missed her prom due to being in the hospital and helped him a lot with social skills and overcoming anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because prom should be their special night and wants him to herself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's trying to do something nice for a friend who helped him a lot. He feels a sense of gratitude and wants to give back. The friend didn't get to go to prom, so this could be a way to honor her and share a positive experience. He might see it as a group activity rather than a date, but the girlfriend's feeling that it's their special time is valid.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: Prom is a significant, often one-time event for high school students. She might feel that bringing another person, especially someone who's not her friend, could make it less special. She might also feel insecure or like he's prioritizing his friendship over their relationship. Communication is key here, but the girlfriend has a right to want her partner's attention on their special night.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms: Prom is typically a couples' event, though sometimes people attend with friends or in groups. However, bringing someone who is a close friend and not your partner could be seen as a breach of expectations, depending on how the girlfriend views it. The age difference (friend is 20) might not be the main issue unless there are other factors, but the question is more about the act of bringing someone along.\n\nThe author's intention is good, but intentions don't always align with the other person's feelings. The girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author might not have considered how his action could be perceived as dismissive of their relationship's importance. It's possible that the author didn't communicate his reasons clearly enough, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's feelings and expectations is crucial. If the author truly values his girlfriend's perspective, he might need to reconsider or find a compromise. However, the request to bring the friend might be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's desire for a private, special moment.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, the action could be seen as inconsiderate from the girlfriend's viewpoint. The answer would depend on whether the friendship's importance outweighs the girlfriend's expectations. But in the context of a relationship, the girlfriend's feelings about a special event are significant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friendship without fully considering the impact on his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
