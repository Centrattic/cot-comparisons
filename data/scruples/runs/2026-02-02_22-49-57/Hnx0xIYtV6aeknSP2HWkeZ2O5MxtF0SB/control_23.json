With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and the girlfriend wants it to be a special, just-the-two-of-them night. But the author wants to bring a female friend (20 years old) who never went to her prom because she was in the hospital. This friend helped the author a lot when he started his job, improving his social skills and overcoming anxiety.\n\nSo the main conflict is between the girlfriend's desire for a private night and the author's desire to include a friend who's important to him. The key points here are the motivations of both parties. The author's reason is gratitude and wanting to give back to someone who helped him. The girlfriend's reason is that prom is a special occasion for couples, and she wants it to be just the two of them.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around prom. Typically, prom is a couple's event, and bringing someone else might be seen as odd or disrespectful to the girlfriend's wishes. But the author's justification is about a close friend who missed out on prom. But is it fair to bring someone else into what's supposed to be a couple's night?\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's feelings. Even though the friend didn't know the author until now, the girlfriend is his current partner. Trust and communication are important in a relationship. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before making plans with his friend, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is rooted in appreciation and wanting to do something nice for his friend. But does that outweigh the girlfriend's expectations? Relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend is expressing her desire for the night to be special and exclusive, which is a valid expectation. If the author insists on bringing his friend, it might make the girlfriend feel neglected or less prioritized.\n\nAnother angle: the friend is female. The author is bringing another girl along. The girlfriend might feel uncomfortable or insecure about that. Even if the friend is a close friend, it's possible that the girlfriend perceives this as the author wanting to include someone else in their special night, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if he can communicate effectively and find a compromise. But since the girlfriend is opposed and the author is pushing forward, that's where the problem lies. The author should consider his girlfriend's feelings more and maybe find another way to include his friend without compromising their special night together.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's motivation is good, but the action of ignoring his girlfriend's wishes could be seen as wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should prioritize her by respecting her wishes, even if it means finding another way to support his friend.\n"
