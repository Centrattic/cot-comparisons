With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he and his girlfriend are going to prom, but he wants to include his female friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship, so the girlfriend's feelings are important. Bringing a third person might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. But the author also has a reason rooted in gratitude\u2014his friend helped him develop socially and he wants to give back. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's perspective is valid. A prom date is often seen as an intimate event between two people. Including someone else without the partner's consent could be seen as disregarding their feelings. The girlfriend might feel that the author is not considering her needs for the night to be just about them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation isn't just selfish. He's trying to do something nice for a friend who helped him a lot. It's a gesture of gratitude, which is commendable. However, the key here is communication. The author should have discussed this idea with his girlfriend earlier and tried to understand her concerns. Since he's already discussed it and the girlfriend is opposed, he needs to weigh his friend's needs against his partner's feelings.\n\nIs the author inherently in the wrong? Well, he's trying to do something good, but the situation is about conflicting priorities. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author might be neglecting her perspective. But it's not a clear-cut wrong. Maybe the problem is more about how he approached it rather than the intention itself. However, since the girlfriend is upset, the author might need to reconsider including the friend to respect her wishes. So, perhaps he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's a responsibility to consider both sides. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is his partner, her feelings might take precedence. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his friend's needs without considering his girlfriend's wishes, leading to conflict. But maybe not entirely, since his intentions are good. Hmm. It's tricky. Some might say B, that he's not in the wrong because he's being kind, but others might say A because he's not respecting his girlfriend's needs. The answer might depend on cultural norms around prom and relationships. In many cases, partners' comfort is crucial. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries. So Answer A.\n"
