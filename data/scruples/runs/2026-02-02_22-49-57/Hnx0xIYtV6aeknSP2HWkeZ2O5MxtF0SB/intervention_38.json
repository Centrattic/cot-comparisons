With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and the friend is 20. The friend didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. The author feels the friend helped him a lot with social skills and wants to take her as a way to give back. The girlfriend is upset and wants the prom to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus fulfilling a personal obligation to the friend. Prom is typically a romantic event, so bringing another person might be seen as violating that expectation. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special night, so she might feel hurt or disrespected. The author thinks he's doing the right thing by repaying the friend's support.\n\nBut there's a potential conflict between the two relationships. The author is prioritizing his gratitude towards the friend over his girlfriend's wishes. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If the girlfriend is clearly opposed, the author might need to consider her feelings. However, the author's reasoning is about repayment for past help, which could be a valid point. However, bringing someone else to a typically romantic event might be seen as crossing a line, even with good intentions.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. Prom is usually a two-person event. Inviting a third person, especially a close friend, might be unconventional and could be perceived as inconsiderate of the girlfriend's expectations. The author might not realize that this action could be hurtful. However, the intent here is positive\u2014helping a friend who missed out. But the impact on the girlfriend is significant. \n\nThe key is whether the author's action is respectful to both the friend and his girlfriend. The friend might not want to be in a trio situation, even if it's out of kindness. Also, the girlfriend's feelings of wanting a special night with her partner are important. The author might be in a position where he's trying to do a good deed but isn't considering the relational consequences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions are good, but the action might be seen as inconsiderate to the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend might feel that her partner is prioritizing someone else's needs over their relationship. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's feelings, even if the motivation is positive. The right thing would be to find a solution that respects both parties, like taking the friend to another event instead of prom. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
