With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The scenario involves a boyfriend (17 M) and his girlfriend (18 F) who have been dating almost a year. The boyfriend wants to invite his female friend (20 F) who missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped him with social skills when he was struggling with anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is the girlfriend's objection. She wants the prom to be a special night just for them. The boyfriend feels it's an opportunity to give back to his friend who supported him. \n\nI should think about the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a significant event, often seen as a romantic milestone. She might feel excluded or that the boyfriend is prioritizing someone else's happiness over their relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reason for inviting the friend is rooted in gratitude and past support. \n\nIs the boyfriend being inconsiderate? Maybe. He didn't consult his girlfriend about this before deciding. But he also has valid reasons. The problem is that relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he went ahead without discussing it, that's a problem. However, if he's trying to explain his reasons and there's a disagreement, it's a communication issue rather than being inherently wrong. \n\nAlso, the friend's situation is valid\u2014missing prom due to hospitalization. The boyfriend wants to make up for that. But bringing her along with his girlfriend could make the girlfriend feel like the third wheel. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more and perhaps found a compromise, like attending separately or ensuring his girlfriend feels included. But his intention isn't malicious. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the answer often depends on whether the action was selfish. Here, the boyfriend's action isn't purely selfish; it's about gratitude. However, he might not have balanced both his and his girlfriend's needs. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No), but with the note that he could have handled it better. The key is whether his action disregards his girlfriend's feelings. If he's willing to listen and adjust, then it's not his fault. But if he insists without considering her, then maybe. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not if there's a solution. \n\nGiven that he's trying to justify his actions with good reasons, and the girlfriend is upset, but the boyfriend isn't entirely wrong-headed. So the answer is B.\n"
