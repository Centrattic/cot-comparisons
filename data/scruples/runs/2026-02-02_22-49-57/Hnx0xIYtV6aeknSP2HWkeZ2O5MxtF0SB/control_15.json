With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the reasoning provided.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is against it because she wants a special night just for the two of them. That's understandable; prom is typically seen as a romantic event for couples. The author, however, argues that bringing his friend is a way to give back for the support she provided, especially since the friend missed out on prom due to hospitalization. The friend is important to him because she helped him develop social skills when he was struggling with anxiety.\n\nSo, the main conflict is between the girlfriend's desire for a romantic evening and the author's desire to honor his friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, respecting the partner's feelings is crucial. Even if the author has a good reason, the girlfriend's feelings about the event being their special night might take precedence. However, the author's intention is to show gratitude, which is positive. \n\nBut prom traditions often emphasize it being a couple's event. Bringing another person could disrupt that expectation. The girlfriend feeling excluded might be valid. The author might need to find a compromise, like inviting the friend separately or finding another way to celebrate with her. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since relationships require mutual respect, not considering the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because he's prioritizing his friend's inclusion over his girlfriend's comfort in a traditionally romantic setting.\n"
