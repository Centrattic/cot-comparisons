With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy and his girlfriend are going to prom, but he wants to bring a close female friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night. The guy feels he owes this friend a lot for helping him develop social skills and overcome anxiety.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationship between the guy and his girlfriend, the friend's role in his life, and the girlfriend's feelings. The guy's intention is to honor his friend's missed experience and repay her kindness. But bringing another person to a typically couple-centric event could be a point of conflict.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, prom is a traditional event for couples. She might see it as their moment, and having another girl there could make her feel excluded or less prioritized. On the other hand, the guy's friend is important to him, and he's trying to include someone who helped him significantly. \n\nI should consider relationship norms. Proms are usually for couples, so inviting a third person might not be the norm. However, the guy's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back. But does that outweigh the girlfriend's emotional needs? \n\nMaybe the guy didn't consult his girlfriend about this before deciding, which could be a problem. He says they sat down to talk about plans, but maybe he didn't get her opinion when discussing it with his friend. Communication is key in relationships. If he didn't check in with her about including his friend, that could be a misstep.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's feeling of wanting the night to be special for them is valid. Relationships require balancing personal connections with the partner's comfort. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings shouldn't be dismissed. \n\nThe guy might need to find a solution that respects both perspectives, like maybe bringing the friend in a different way that doesn't include the prom itself, or explaining the significance to the girlfriend and seeing if there's a compromise. But in terms of being in the wrong, if he went ahead without considering her feelings, that's an issue. If he's been transparent and willing to discuss, maybe not. The story doesn't specify if he discussed it with his girlfriend before the friend at work came up with the idea.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to weigh the girlfriend's right to have a special night versus the guy's desire to include his friend. Maybe there's a middle ground, but in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit grey. However, typically, in such cases, the partner's feelings about a shared event might take precedence. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's expectation of exclusivity, without sufficient discussion. But the story says he did talk to his friend at work after discussing with his girlfriend, which might not have been the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, if he's trying to be grateful and includes someone who helped him, that's positive, but it's about how he's balancing both relationships. It's a tough call. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the girlfriend is upset, perhaps the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted because the friend's role is significant. However, in a relationship, sometimes the partner's needs take priority in such situations. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
