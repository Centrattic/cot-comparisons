With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user is a 17-year-old guy whose girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring his female friend (20 F) with them. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital. This friend was important to him when he started a new job, helped him with social anxiety, and he wants to give back.\n\nThe girlfriend is against it because she wants their special night to herself. The user is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA). The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a committed relationship, so expecting some level of exclusivity in a special event like prom makes sense. Prom is traditionally a romantic event between couples, so bringing another person might be seen as not respecting her feelings or the nature of the event. She feels it's their night, so he's inviting someone else. That could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is trying to acknowledge the friend's support and give back. He's in a situation where this friend helped him a lot, and he wants to do something nice. But the friend is a girl, and bringing her along with the girlfriend might complicate things. \n\nI should think about communication. Did the user discuss this with his girlfriend before? The post says they \"sat down to talk about our plans\" and then later talked at work. Maybe he didn't properly explain the significance of the friend until after the girlfriend was already opposed. If he had explained the friend's importance earlier, maybe the girlfriend could have been on board. \n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's feelings versus the friend's. The user is trying to balance two relationships, but bringing a third person to a romantic event might not be fair to the girlfriend. The girlfriend's feeling that it's their special night is valid. The user might not be considering the emotional impact on his partner. \n\nIs there another way he could honor his friend without involving her in prom? Maybe another gesture instead of attending prom together. But the user feels compelled to include her because she missed out. However, the girlfriend's priority is their relationship. It's a conflict of values.\n\nIn relationships, respect and communication are key. The user might not be in the wrong if he's trying to be grateful, but he's not considering his girlfriend's perspective enough. The girlfriend's right to have a special night with her partner is also important. So, the user might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friend's needs over his partner's feelings without sufficient compromise or understanding.\n"
