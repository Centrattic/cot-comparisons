With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl, their friend, to prom with their girlfriend and themselves. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a guy in a relationship with an 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring his female friend (20 years old) because she couldn't go to her prom due to hospitalization. He values this friendship because the friend helped him socially when he was struggling with social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it should be their special night, and the author feels he's giving back to someone who helped him.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break down possible angles. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, prom is typically seen as a couple's event. She might feel that including another person ruins the intimacy and exclusivity of the evening. That's a valid emotional response. She's in a relationship and might expect her partner's primary focus to be on her during such an event.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the friend has been a significant positive influence in his life, helping him overcome social anxiety. He wants to acknowledge her impact by involving her in this experience. The friend couldn't attend prom before, and this is a way to make up for that. The author's intention is to show gratitude, which is a noble cause.\n\nBut there's a potential conflict here between the couple's expectations and the author's desire to include a friend. The key issue is communication and mutual understanding. Did the author consult his girlfriend early enough? He mentioned they had plans already, but he also discussed it at work, which might have caused her to feel blindsided. \n\nAnother angle: cultural norms. Prom is often a couple's event, so inviting a third person might clash with that. However, in some cases, people do bring friends, especially if it's a group event. But the way the author wants to include the friend is as a third person with the couple, not as a separate group. That could disrupt the dynamics.\n\nAlso, the friend's perspective isn't discussed here. Are they comfortable with going to prom with the couple? If the friend is okay, then maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. But the main conflict is with the girlfriend.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs matter. The author is prioritizing his friend's gratitude, but the girlfriend's feelings are also valid. The question is whether the author's request is reasonable. \n\nCould there be a middle ground? Maybe the author could have proposed a different way to honor his friend, like a separate event, or explained the significance more clearly to the girlfriend. However, the author might feel strongly that this is the right gesture. \n\nGiven all that, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's intentions are commendable. However, since the girlfriend is in the relationship and the prom is a couple's event typically, the author's actions might not consider her feelings adequately. So maybe he is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B.\n"
