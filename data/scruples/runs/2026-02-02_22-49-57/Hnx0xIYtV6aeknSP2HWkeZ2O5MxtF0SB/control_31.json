With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a 17-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is a big deal, usually a couple event. The author wants to take his friend, a 20-year-old girl who couldn't go to prom before, because she helped him develop social skills when he had anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because it's supposed to be their special night and she wants him to herself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, bringing another person along on a date that's traditionally a two-person event could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. Prom is often considered a significant milestone for couples, so the girlfriend's desire for it to be just the two of them is understandable. The author's reasoning is that he wants to give back to his friend, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important. \n\nHowever, the author might feel that the friend's situation and his own gratitude are valid reasons. But in a relationship, partners usually expect to prioritize each other in such events. The friend is important, but the girlfriend is his significant other. Bringing another girl might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's intention is noble, but the impact on the relationship could be negative. The key here is whether the action is considered wrong. Since the girlfriend is clearly upset, the author's plan could be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings, thus making him in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps the author should have discussed it more carefully, but the act itself isn't necessarily wrong. However, given that the girlfriend is the romantic partner, the expectation is higher to prioritize her. So the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong). However, some might say that his intentions are good, so B (no). \n\nBut in most cultural contexts, relationships expect exclusivity and prioritization in such events. Bringing another person could be seen as a breach of that expectation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
