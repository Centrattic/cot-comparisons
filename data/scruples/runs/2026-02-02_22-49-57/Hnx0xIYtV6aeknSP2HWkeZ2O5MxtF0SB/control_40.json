With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a 17-year-old guy who's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. They're planning prom together. Then he talks to a female friend at work, who's 20 and never went to her prom because she was in the hospital. He feels this friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and lack of skills. He wants to take her to prom as a way to give back. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special and just for them.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the perspectives. The girlfriend's side: prom is traditionally a romantic event, so she might see it as their special night. Bringing another person could make her feel excluded or less important. On the other hand, the author's reasoning is that his friend helped him a lot and he wants to reciprocate. But bringing her to prom could be seen as a breach of trust or respect for the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn relationships, especially romantic ones, partners often have expectations about such events. The girlfriend's objection is about wanting the night to be \"their\" special time. The author's friend didn't have a prom experience, so he's trying to do something kind for her. However, prom is usually a couple's event. Inviting another person might cross a line, even if the intention is good. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The author should consider his girlfriend's feelings and the possible implications. Even though the friend is significant in his personal growth, the setting of prom is a romantic one. Maybe the author could find another way to celebrate with his friend without involving the prom, like a separate event or a different kind of gesture. \n\nBut the author's friend is a girl, which might make the situation more sensitive. The girlfriend could perceive it as a potential threat or a lack of commitment to their relationship. The author's intention is noble, but the action might not be appropriate. \n\nI think the answer is A, meaning the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are valid in this context, and prom is typically a couple's event. Even if the friend is important, the author should prioritize his partner's wishes for their special night. He could express gratitude to his friend in a different way without compromising the couple's dynamic.\n"
