With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships involved. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. That's a significant relationship, so prom is likely seen as a special event for the two of them. The girlfriend's perspective is important here\u2014she wants the night to be just the two of them. That's understandable; prom is often considered a milestone where couples want to focus on each other without others.\n\nThen there's the friend, who is 20 and important to the author. She didn't get to go to prom due to hospitalization, and she helped him when he was struggling socially. The author feels a sense of gratitude and wants to give back. His reasoning is about making amends and recognizing her support. But here's the conflict: the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include someone else.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, when one partner wants to include someone else in a date that's traditionally for a couple, it can be seen as a breach of trust or respect. The girlfriend's feeling that the night should be \"her special night\" suggests that she views prom as a couple's event. The author's intention might be noble, but the act of involving another person could be hurtful. Even if the friend is a close confidant, the girlfriend might feel that this inclusion is a sign of neglect or a lack of prioritization of their relationship.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. Prom is often about the couple, so bringing a third person might not be the norm. The author might not realize how this could affect his girlfriend's feelings. The key here is communication. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend earlier and explained the reasons, maybe there could be a compromise. But since the girlfriend is already opposed, it's a red flag. The author's plan might undermine the girlfriend's need for a special, exclusive moment with him.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the friend might not know the extent of her influence on his progress. That's a good point, but the decision to include her in a date is still a relational choice that affects his partner. The author's gratitude is valid, but the way he's choosing to express it might not consider his girlfriend's emotional needs as much.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intention is to honor a friend's past and show gratitude, but the action could be seen as disrespectful to his girlfriend's expectations. The girlfriend's opposition is a clear sign that this might not be the best course of action. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his partner's feelings in a context that's traditionally intimate for couples.\n"
