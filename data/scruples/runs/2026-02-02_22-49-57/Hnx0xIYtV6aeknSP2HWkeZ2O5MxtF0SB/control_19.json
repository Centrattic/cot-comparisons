With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about wanting to bring another girl, a friend, to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is opposed because it's supposed to be their special night. The author argues that the friend helped him a lot and he wants to give back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main points are the commitment to the girlfriend versus the gratitude towards the friend. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because prom is typically a couple's event. She might feel that bringing another person undermines their relationship's importance. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about reciprocity and appreciation for his friend's support. However, prom is usually an intimate event between a couple. Bringing another person could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend's wishes and expectations. The author's friend is important, but the girlfriend's request for the night to be just them should be respected. \n\nAdditionally, the author's social growth was helped by the friend, but that doesn't justify disregarding his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is that she expects exclusivity on a date night. The friend might not have the same level of commitment or expectations as a romantic partner. \n\nSo, the question is about balancing gratitude with respect for the girlfriend's boundaries. The author might be in the wrong if he prioritizes his friend's needs over his girlfriend's wishes without considering the impact. The girlfriend's feelings of being prioritized in a romantic context are important. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for their special night.\n"
