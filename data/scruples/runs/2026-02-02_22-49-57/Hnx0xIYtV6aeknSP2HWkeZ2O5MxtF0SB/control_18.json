With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. His friend, a 20-year-old woman, missed her prom due to hospitalization. This friend helped him a lot at work, building his social skills and overcoming anxiety. Now he wants to take her to prom as a way to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to herself.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's significance in his life, the reason for not having a prom, and the girlfriend's feelings about sharing the prom night.\n\nI should consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a big deal for couples; it's their special time. The girlfriend might feel he's prioritizing someone else over their relationship. On the other hand, the author feels a moral obligation to his friend who helped him. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could have discussed it earlier, or perhaps the friend could attend in another way, like as a group. But the author is set on bringing her as a third wheel. That could make the girlfriend feel neglected. \n\nAlso, the age difference: the friend is 20, and the girlfriend is 18. Maybe the girlfriend feels insecure about his friendship with an older woman. But that's speculative. \n\nThe main issue is whether it's respectful to include another person in a traditionally couple-oriented event without considering the partner's feelings. The author didn't consult his girlfriend about this idea, leading to her opposition. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's decision might be seen as selfish from the girlfriend's viewpoint. Even if his intentions are good, not considering her feelings could be a mistake. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards yes because he's disregarding his girlfriend's feelings for his own reasons, even if those reasons are valid. Prom is a shared experience, and bringing a third person might be seen as a breach of trust or respect.\n"
