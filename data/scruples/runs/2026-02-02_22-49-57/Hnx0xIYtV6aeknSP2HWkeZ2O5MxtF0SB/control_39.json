With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he and his girlfriend are planning to go together, but he wants to include his friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot with his social skills and anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special for just the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is often seen as a significant, intimate event. If the girlfriend is expecting it to be a private moment with her boyfriend, adding another person might feel like a betrayal or a lack of consideration for her feelings. It's important in relationships to respect each other's expectations and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to express gratitude to a friend who had a significant impact on his life. The friend didn't have the chance to attend her own prom, so including her could be seen as a kind and thoughtful gesture. However, the key issue here is the way the author approached this. Did he consider his girlfriend's feelings first? If he didn't discuss this with her before making the suggestion, that might be a problem. The girlfriend's opposition might stem from not being consulted until after the idea was already presented.\n\nCommunication is crucial. The author might have assumed his intentions were purely good, but relationships require mutual respect and agreement. The girlfriend's desire for a special night is valid, and the author's actions could be seen as undermining that. Even if the friend is important, the prom is a couple's event. Bringing a third person might not be the best way to handle it, especially without prior consent from the girlfriend.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author's friend is just a close friend, but the girlfriend might perceive it as bringing a romantic interest or someone who could cause jealousy. The author's explanation about the friend's absence from her own prom adds context, but it's about his intentions versus the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend has a right to feel that her partner is prioritizing someone else's needs over their relationship's.\n\nPossible solutions: The author could have tried to find another way to honor his friend, or perhaps made arrangements to include her without taking her to the prom with the couple. But since he's asking if he's in the wrong, the main point is whether his action is acceptable. Without the girlfriend's agreement, inviting her to a couples event could be seen as disrespectful. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings first and is trying to include someone in an event that's meant for two, which can lead to hurt feelings even if the intention is good.\n"
