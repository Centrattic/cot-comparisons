With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend (17M) has been dating his girlfriend (18F) for almost a year. They were planning to go to prom together. Then his friend (20F) comes into the picture. This friend didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. The friend was instrumental in helping the author develop social skills when he started his job, especially since he had social anxiety. Now, the author wants to take his friend to prom as a way to give back.\n\nBut the girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be special and just for the two of them. The main conflict is between the boyfriend's gratitude towards his friend and the girlfriend's desire for a private, exclusive evening.\n\nI need to consider the expectations and norms around prom. Typically, prom is a special event for couples, and bringing someone else might disrupt that. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might feel her partner is prioritizing someone else over their relationship. However, the author's reasons are rooted in gratitude and wanting to give back, which is understandable.\n\nBut is it wrong? Well, the girlfriend has a right to feel that her partner should focus on her on that night. The author might not realize how his actions could affect the relationship. Also, there's the aspect of communication. Did they discuss this before making plans? It seems they did plan together initially, then the friend was brought into the conversation later, which might have caused the conflict.\n\nAnother angle: bringing a third person to prom could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if it's a friend, it's a couples' event. The girlfriend's priority is their relationship, and the boyfriend's is his gratitude. Both have valid points, but the girlfriend's concern about the special night being compromised might take precedence here.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot, but given the context, he might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's feelings without considering the impact on their relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is about the significance of the event to their relationship, which is a key factor in such situations.\n"
