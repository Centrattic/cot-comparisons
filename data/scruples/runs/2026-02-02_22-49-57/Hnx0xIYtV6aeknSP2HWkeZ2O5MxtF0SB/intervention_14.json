With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The author is a guy, 17, in a relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend for almost a year. The friend in question is a 20-year-old woman who helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and lacked social skills. She's important to him because she was the first to befriend him at work and supported him through tough times.\n\nThe author wants to take this friend to prom, even though his girlfriend is against it. She wants the night to be special and just for the two of them. The author feels that bringing the friend is a way to give back for her help, as the friend missed her prom due to being in the hospital.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. From the girlfriend's perspective, prom is a significant event meant for the couple. She might feel that including another person, even if he's a friend, could take attention away from their relationship. On the other hand, the author has a valid reason rooted in gratitude and the friend's personal circumstances. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. Did the author discuss this with his girlfriend before considering the plan? The post mentions they sat down to talk about plans, so maybe that's when the issue came up. The girlfriend's objection is about wanting the night to be special for them, which is a common concern in relationships. The author's reasoning is about reciprocity and acknowledging the friend's support. \n\nHowever, prom is typically a couple's event. Bringing a third person might not be the norm and could lead to jealousy or hurt feelings. The friend not having gone to prom could make it a special experience for her, but the author needs to consider his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nAnother angle: the friend is a close friend who helped him, but is it appropriate to bring her to a date with his girlfriend? It might be seen as prioritizing the friendship over the romantic relationship. Relationships often require balancing personal relationships with the partner's expectations. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if he's being honest about his intentions, but he should consider his girlfriend's feelings. Maybe a compromise could be possible, like attending separately or finding another way to celebrate the friend. However, if the author insists on going together, he might be neglecting his girlfriend's perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons, the primary event is a date, and the girlfriend's feelings are important. The answer might hinge on whether bringing the friend is seen as respectful to the girlfriend's desires. Since the girlfriend is opposed, the author might be in the wrong by not fully respecting her wishes, but there's a case for his intentions being good. However, in the context of a date, the girlfriend's right to have a special night is significant.\n"
