With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend (17M) is in a relationship with his girlfriend (18F) for almost a year. Now prom is coming up, and he wants to bring his female friend (20F) because she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. He mentions that this friend has been really supportive, helping him with social anxiety and improving his social skills. His girlfriend is against it because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's intention to include a close friend for a valid reason, versus the girlfriend's desire for a private, couple-only event. The question is whether the boyfriend is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider relationships and boundaries. Bringing a third person to a couples event might be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting the girlfriend's wishes. But the boyfriend has a good reason, and maybe the issue is communication. Did he ask his girlfriend beforehand? The story says they had talked about plans, but when he mentioned the friend, the girlfriend opposed it. \n\nIs it about respect? The boyfriend is trying to honor his friend's past and show gratitude. But the girlfriend is feeling left out or not considered. Maybe he should have considered her feelings more before making the request. However, he did mention the friend's situation and his reasons. \n\nAnother angle: prom is traditionally a couples event. Including a third person might make the girlfriend feel that her partner is prioritizing someone else. But the boyfriend is also valuing a friendship that helped him a lot. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. If he didn't consult her properly or dismissed her feelings, that could be wrong. But the story says they had discussed plans, and when he talked to his friend at work, he didn't inform his girlfriend. Maybe the issue is that he didn't include her in the decision-making process. \n\nAlso, the friend's age is 20, which could be a red flag if there's any misunderstanding or if the girlfriend is jealous. But the main conflict is about the event's nature as a couples' night versus the boy's gratitude. \n\nI think the boyfriend has valid reasons, but he might have failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings adequately. However, the intention isn't malicious. The girlfriend's opposition is valid too. It's a conflict between two valid perspectives. The answer might hinge on whether the boyfriend's actions were respectful and communicative. Since he did explain the reasons but the girlfriend is still opposed, maybe the issue is about compromise. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs matter. But is the boyfriend in the wrong? If he went ahead without her approval, that's a problem. But if they discussed it and he still felt it was important, maybe not. The key here is whether he respected her wishes after discussing. The story doesn't say he went ahead without her permission yet. He's asking for advice. \n\nSo, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because his intention is good, but he needs to address his girlfriend's feelings and find a compromise. Therefore, answer B.\n"
