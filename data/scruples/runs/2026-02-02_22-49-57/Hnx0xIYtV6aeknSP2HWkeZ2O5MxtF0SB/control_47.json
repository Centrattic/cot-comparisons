With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend planning prom, and the boyfriend wants to include a female friend who missed her prom due to hospitalization.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's perspective: She's dating the guy, and they've been together almost a year. She likely sees prom as a special event for the two of them, a traditional milestone where couples celebrate together. Her objection might stem from feeling that inviting someone else could dilute the intimacy or make her feel less important.\n\nThe boyfriend's side: He's close to this female friend who helped him through social anxiety and low social skills. He wants to include her as a way to reciprocate the support. He feels it's a way to give back, which shows he values their friendship and her contribution to his personal growth.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The boyfriend is in a committed relationship, so introducing a new person into a date night could be problematic. Prom is typically a two-person event. Even if the intention is noble, bringing another person might affect the girlfriend's feelings. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The boyfriend should have considered how his girlfriend would feel before making the suggestion. While his reasons are heartfelt towards his friend, he needs to balance his friend's needs with his girlfriend's expectations. The girlfriend's concern about the night being \"their special time\" is valid in the context of a romantic relationship. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of gratitude and friendship. The boyfriend might feel it's important to honor his friend's past experiences. But in a romantic context, the girlfriend's feelings are equally important. The conflict arises from clashing priorities between the boyfriend's personal gratitude and the girlfriend's desire for an exclusive celebration. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If he hasn't communicated properly or dismissed his girlfriend's feelings, then yes. But since he's seeking advice, it's possible he's trying to find a middle ground. However, the act of wanting to bring another person to a romantic event might be seen as inconsiderate regardless of the reason, unless there's a mutual agreement. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the girlfriend's perspective in a relationship should take precedence unless they both agree otherwise, and the boyfriend's actions might not respect her feelings adequately.\n"
