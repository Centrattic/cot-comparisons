With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the guy and his girlfriend have been dating almost a year. He wants to include his friend who missed prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot when he started his job and improved his social skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is opposed because it's supposed to be their special night. The guy argues it's a way to give back to the friend. The key points are the friend's history of helping him and the girlfriend feeling left out.\n\nI should think about social norms. Prom is typically a date event, so inviting someone else might be seen as unusual. But the guy's reasoning is about gratitude. However, bringing another girl could make the girlfriend feel less important. The girlfriend's perspective is valid; she might see it as a betrayal of trust or a lack of consideration for their relationship's exclusivity.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's intentions are genuine. He's trying to honor someone who helped him. But relationships often require considering the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's desire for a private, special night is understandable. Maybe the guy should have discussed it more carefully, considering her feelings first.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a balance between two valid viewpoints. The action itself (inviting the friend) is questionable because it goes against the expectation of a couple-only event. However, the intent is positive. But the girlfriend's feelings are important. The answer might hinge on whether the guy's action respects their relationship's boundaries. If the girlfriend felt it was necessary to be exclusive, then the guy might be in the wrong. But if the friend was part of their group or the girlfriend knew about the friendship beforehand, maybe not. However, since the girlfriend is upset, it's more likely that he's in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his partner's feelings enough.\n"
