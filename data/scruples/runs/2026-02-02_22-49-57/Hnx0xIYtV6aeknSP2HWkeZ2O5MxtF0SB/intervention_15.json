With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nSo the situation is that the author, a 17-year-old guy, has been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. They were planning to go to prom together. But then he met his friend, a 20-year-old girl, who didn't get to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. He feels that she helped him a lot with his social anxiety and he wants to take her to prom as a way to thank her. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be special for them.\n\nFirst, prom is typically a romantic event for couples, so bringing someone else might be seen as not considering the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend might feel that the prom is their special time, and having another person there could make it less intimate. On the other hand, the author is trying to do something nice for a friend who helped him a lot. \n\nBut the key here is the girlfriend's perspective. Even though the author has valid reasons, he's supposed to be going with his girlfriend. Prom is a big deal for high school students, and including another person might be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's wishes. The girlfriend might feel like her needs are being overlooked. \n\nAlso, the author is in a relationship, so his primary commitment is to his girlfriend. While friendships are important, the girlfriend's feelings matter here. The author should consider whether bringing his friend is worth potentially hurting his girlfriend's feelings. Maybe there's a middle ground, like making separate plans with the friend that don't involve the prom itself. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event. Even if his intentions are good, the action could be seen as inconsiderate towards his partner.\n"
