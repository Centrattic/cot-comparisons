With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that the author is a 17-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his female friend, who's 20, to prom with them. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital, and she helped him a lot when he started his job, improving his social skills. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night and not have the friend there.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The main conflict is between the boyfriend's desire to include his friend out of gratitude and the girlfriend's desire for a private, exclusive night with him. \n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he's trying to express gratitude to a friend who helped him a lot. That's understandable. He mentions that she was instrumental in his personal growth, which shows he values their friendship and wants to reciprocate the kindness. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is feeling that this night should be about their relationship. She's in a committed relationship and expects her partner to prioritize their time together. It's natural for her to feel left out or not wanted if someone else is brought into what's supposed to be a romantic event. \n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship expectations. Prom is typically seen as a romantic event, so bringing someone else might be perceived as inconsiderate. However, the author's intentions are good. The key here is whether the boyfriend communicated this properly and considered his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nThe question is if the boyfriend is in the wrong. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. While the boyfriend has valid reasons, he should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier and perhaps found a compromise. For instance, maybe they could have a separate dinner with the friend or attend a different event together. Taking the friend to prom might make the girlfriend feel neglected, which isn't fair to her either. \n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's perspective. She might feel that her boyfriend is prioritizing his friend over their relationship, which can lead to jealousy or insecurity. Even if the intentions are good, the action might not consider her emotional needs. \n\nSo, the boyfriend isn't entirely wrong because he's trying to do something kind and appreciative, but he may not have considered his girlfriend's feelings adequately. The girlfriend is also valid in her feelings. The wrong here might not be entirely on one side. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's more about whether his actions were inappropriate.\n\nIn many cases, relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend insisted on bringing the friend without considering the girlfriend's feelings, that's where the issue lies. The girlfriend's request for a private night is reasonable, so the boyfriend should prioritize that unless there's a way to make both parties feel valued. \n\nTherefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't account for his girlfriend's feelings and expectations, even though his intentions were good. The key is that in a relationship, the partner's needs and the relationship's dynamics should be prioritized unless there's a clear mutual agreement.\n"
