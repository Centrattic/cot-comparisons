With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user is a 17-year-old guy with an 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. The main issue is that he wants to bring his female friend, who never went to prom because she was in the hospital, to prom with them. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night for just the two of them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dynamics of the relationship and the expectations around prom. Prom is traditionally a couples' event, so the girlfriend's perspective is understandable. She might feel that bringing another person, even a friend, could take away from their special time. The author's reasoning is that this friend helped him a lot, especially with social anxiety, and he wants to give back. \n\nBut is it wrong to want to do that? Well, the girlfriend's feelings are important. Even if the author's intentions are good, he needs to consider how this might affect his relationship. Relationships require compromise. If the girlfriend is clearly opposed, the author might need to find another way to honor his friend without including them in the prom night. \n\nAlso, bringing another girl along could potentially make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. Even if the friend is a close one, prom is a significant event in their relationship. The author might be overstepping if he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings as much as his friend's. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier. Since he mentioned they talked about prom plans, perhaps he didn't present his reasons clearly enough. Maybe there's a middle ground, like finding another way to include the friend or having a separate event. But the girlfriend's main point is about the night being special for them. If the author insists, he could be inconsiderate, making him at least partially responsible. \n\nSo, weighing the two sides: the author's good intentions vs. the girlfriend's emotional needs. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because relationships often require mutual respect and consideration. The author might not be entirely wrong if he's trying to honor his friend, but he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings enough. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his partner's feelings in a significant event.\n"
