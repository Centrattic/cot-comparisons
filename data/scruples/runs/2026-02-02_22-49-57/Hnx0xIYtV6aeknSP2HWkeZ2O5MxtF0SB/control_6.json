With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person (17M) is in a relationship with an 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and the guy wants to take his friend (20F) with them. The friend missed her prom due to hospitalization and was instrumental in helping him with social skills and overcoming anxiety. The girlfriend is upset, wanting it to be a special night just for them.\n\nSo the main question is whether the guy is wrong for wanting to bring his friend. Let's break down the factors. The friend is important to him and helped him a lot. He feels like this is a way to give back. But the girlfriend feels it's their special night and wants him all to herself.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, the girlfriend's feelings matter. Prom is a significant event, and including a third person could make her feel like she's being overshadowed. The guy's intention is noble, but relationships often require considering the partner's perspective. The girlfriend's objection is valid because it's about the couple's time. The guy might not have considered that his friend might not be comfortable being in that situation either. Also, inviting a third person to a couple's event can create tension or awkwardness. The guy's reasoning is based on gratitude, but the girlfriend's need for a special night is also valid. It's a conflict between personal gratitude and the girlfriend's emotional needs. The key here is whether the guy's actions are respecting his girlfriend's feelings. Since the girlfriend is upset and it's a mutual decision, the guy might be overstepping by not considering her feelings enough. But there's also the aspect of the friend's situation. However, the primary relationship is with the girlfriend, so the boyfriend's actions might be seen as prioritizing his friend's needs over his partner's. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings adequately and didn't seek a compromise that respects both their needs. The girlfriend's objection is about the nature of the event being a couple's time. The guy's action, while well-intentioned, could be seen as disregarding that boundary. So the answer is A.\n"
