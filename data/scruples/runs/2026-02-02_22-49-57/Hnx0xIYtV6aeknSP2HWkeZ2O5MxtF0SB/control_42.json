With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, male, and has been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. He's planning prom and wants to bring his friend, a 20-year-old woman, who didn't get to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot when he started his job, improving his social skills and dealing with anxiety. He feels he owes her this experience. However, his girlfriend is upset and wants the prom to be their special night. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. From the girlfriend's perspective, she might see prom as a significant event meant for couples, and she wants it to be just the two of them. She's in a relationship, so expecting some level of exclusivity is reasonable. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and wanting to give back to his friend. But bringing another person, especially a close female friend, to a couples' event can be seen as crossing a boundary in the relationship.\n\nThe friend's situation is sad, but the author is using his relationship with his girlfriend to make decisions that affect her. Even if the friend didn't know about her importance, the author is involving her in a way that the girlfriend might find disrespectful or inconsiderate. Relationships often require balancing personal friendships with the needs of the partner. While the author has a valid reason, the girlfriend's feelings are also valid. The key here is whether the author communicated this plan properly and considered his girlfriend's perspective. Since he's planning to bring someone else to a couples event without getting her consent, that could be seen as the problem. The girlfriend's objection is about the event being their time, and the author's action might be infringing on that. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's expectations for the event, even if his intentions are good. The situation requires compromise and considering the girlfriend's feelings, which he hasn't done adequately.\n"
