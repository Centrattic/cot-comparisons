With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy (17 M) is asking if he's the asshole for wanting to bring another girl (his friend) to prom with him and his girlfriend (18 F). They've been dating almost a year. The girlfriend is against it because it's supposed to be their special night. The friend missed prom because she was in the hospital, and he feels she helped him a lot with social anxiety and wants to give back.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a big deal for many people, especially a romantic milestone. She might feel hurt or neglected if her boyfriend wants to include another girl. Even though the friend is important to him, this is a date with his girlfriend. It's supposed to be a two-person thing. \n\nBut then, the friend's story is also valid. She missed out on prom, and he's trying to do something nice. The friend helped him a lot, so he wants to return the favor. There's a sense of gratitude here. However, including a third person on a date might not be appropriate. Maybe he could find another way to honor her wish to go to prom, like going separately or doing something else special. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The girlfriend is already opposed to the idea. If he insists, that could be dismissive of her feelings. He might not be considering her perspective enough. Even if he has good intentions, the girlfriend's feelings are important. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could find another way to celebrate his friend without involving the prom. Like a separate event. But the guy wants to take her to prom with them. That's a problem because it's a date between him and his girlfriend. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, while the guy's intentions are good, he's prioritizing his friend's needs over his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend has a right to feel that prom should be their special time. The answer might be that he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her wishes and the nature of a date. The friend's situation is sad, but the prom is a two-person event. Hence, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
