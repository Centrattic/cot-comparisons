With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 17-year-old guy in a relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to bring his 20-year-old female friend who missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety, and he wants to give back by including her in his prom plans. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night just for them.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention is to include a close friend as a gesture of gratitude. However, bringing another person to a date with his girlfriend could be seen as crossing boundaries. Even though the friend is important to him, the girlfriend's feelings are the main issue here. The girlfriend might feel that the prom is a significant event that should be exclusive to the couple. The author's reasoning is about reciprocity and appreciation, but he's not considering the girlfriend's perspective and the expectations of a romantic partner.\n\nNow, thinking about typical social norms. Prom is traditionally a date between couples. Inviting a third person, especially a close friend, might be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. The girlfriend's objection is valid because she wants the attention and focus on their relationship. The author's actions could be perceived as inconsiderate, not because the friend isn't important, but because the prom night is a shared event for the couple. The author might need to find another way to show gratitude to his friend without compromising his partner's expectations.\n\nAlso, the age difference between the author and his friend (20) might not be an issue in terms of legality, but it's more about the relationship dynamics. The main conflict is between the author's gratitude and his commitment to his girlfriend's wishes. The author is in a position where he's supposed to respect his girlfriend's feelings, especially in a relationship. If he insists on bringing the friend, it could lead to hurt feelings or a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the answer here would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's feelings and the nature of the prom as a couple's event. While his intentions are good, the action is problematic in the context of the relationship.\n"
