With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. Prom is a big event, usually a couple's thing. He wants to bring his female friend who missed prom due to hospitalization. His friend helped him a lot with social skills and he wants to give back. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for them.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the girlfriend's feelings about the prom being their special time versus the author wanting to include someone important to him. The question is about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend might feel that including someone else takes away from their special night. The author thinks he's doing something kind for a friend who helped him. But bringing another person to a traditionally couple-oriented event could be seen as a breach of the girlfriend's expectations. Even if the friend is important, prom is typically a two-person event. The author might not have considered how his girlfriend would feel about the third person. However, his intentions are good, trying to repay a friend's kindness.\n\nBut in relationships, both partners' needs are important. If the girlfriend is opposed, the author might need to find another way to include his friend without compromising their evening. Maybe suggest another way to celebrate with the friend, like a separate event. Since the girlfriend's main point is wanting the night just for them, the author not respecting that could be a conflict point. However, the author's reasoning is sincere and not malicious. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If he goes ahead despite her objections, that might be inconsiderate. But if he's trying to balance both his friend's needs and his girlfriend's feelings, it's a communication issue. The answer might depend on whether the author is willing to compromise. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, considering the girlfriend's perspective is crucial. Bringing another person to a prom date could be seen as disrespectful to her wishes, even if his intentions are good. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to his good intentions. However, the key is that the girlfriend's feelings matter in their relationship, and overriding her wishes could be the issue.\n"
