With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy wants to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. His reasoning is that this friend of his, who's important to him, never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He feels he should take her along as a way to give back for all the support she's given him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks prom should be their special night, and she wants him to herself. On the other hand, the guy argues that the friend helped him a lot, and this is a way to thank her. \n\nI wonder if the main issue here is about respect for the girlfriend's feelings versus the guy's desire to make up for his friend's missed opportunity. Prom is a significant event, often seen as a couple's milestone. Bringing another person might make the girlfriend feel less special or included. But the guy's intentions are good\u2014he's trying to do something kind for a friend who's been important to his personal growth.\n\nHowever, the key point might be communication. Did the guy discuss this with his girlfriend before deciding? If he just went ahead without considering her feelings, that's a problem. In the scenario, he did mention they had a conversation about plans, so maybe he did talk to her. But the girlfriend is still opposed. Maybe the guy should have anticipated her feelings and found another way to honor his friend, like attending separately or finding another event for them. \n\nAnother angle is the social norms around prom. Typically, it's a couples' event, so bringing someone else might be seen as unusual or inconsiderate. The girlfriend might feel that his actions prioritize someone else over their relationship. The guy's argument is about gratitude, but relationships also require considering each other's needs. \n\nI think it's a balance. The guy's intentions aren't malicious, but he might not have fully considered his girlfriend's perspective. Maybe a compromise could work, but if he insists on bringing the friend, that might be inconsiderate. However, since he's trying to be grateful, it's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the guy might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes, even if his reasons are good. But some might argue that his actions are justified if the friend truly needs the support. But I think the primary relationship here is with his girlfriend, so he should prioritize her feelings. So maybe answer A (he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because his motives are good.\n"
