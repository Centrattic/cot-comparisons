I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to help his baby sister and moving out. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is the older brother. His mom is pregnant and initially decides to abort, but then changes her mind, keeping the baby. The author had to pay for the abortion but then found out his mom spent all his money on baby items. Now she's accusing him of being selfish and not supporting her. He wants to move out to focus on his education and stop being financially responsible for the family.\n\nSo, why is he considering moving out? He's not doing great in school, has a part-time job, and is trying to save for college. His mom's situation is adding stress, and he's had previous issues with her misusing his money. He's already an adult, turned 18, set up his own bank account, and now has enough to move out.\n\nLegally, in most places, once you're 18, you're an adult and aren't obligated to support your parents financially. The mother's actions, like draining his account without permission, might be a red flag. He's trying to take control of his life and education, which is a valid reason to move out.\n\nBut morally, there's a sense of responsibility. However, the mother isn't being responsible herself\u2014quitting her job, getting pregnant without considering the financial impact, and then changing her mind after taking his money. She's placing the burden on her son who's also trying to get through school.\n\nThe brother's main arguments are his own well-being and future. He's trying to avoid being a parent figure to his sister, which isn't his role. He's also protecting his finances after past misuse. Moving out allows him to focus on his goals without the added stress.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say he's abandoning his family. But given the circumstances\u2014his mother's irresponsibility, his own struggles, and the fact that he's not legally bound\u2014he might have a strong case for not being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are self-preservation and trying to prioritize his future. The mother's actions contributed to the situation, and he's taking steps to protect himself.\n"
