I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to move out and leave his responsibilities regarding his sister. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider a few key points.\n\nFirst, the author's family situation is tough. His dad left when he was young, his mom isn't close to him, and they're both struggling financially. He's trying to work, study, and save for college. His mom gets pregnant with his baby sister, but then his unemployed boyfriend situation complicates things. The mom initially decides to have an abortion but then changes her mind and keeps the baby, using his money for baby items. The author feels he can't trust his mom with his money anymore, which leads him to move out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The author's main argument is that he can't handle the financial burden and wants to focus on his education. He's providing enough to move out and support himself. The mother is arguing that as the older brother, he's responsible. But the author isn't a legal guardian; his mom is. Legally, the responsibility for the child falls on the parents, not siblings. Emotionally and financially, the author is in a tough spot, and moving out might be a way to protect himself from being exploited again.\n\nThe mother's actions\u2014taking his money without permission and changing her decision about the abortion\u2014add to the author's frustration. He's had to cover the abortion cost and then sees his money being used for baby items after she changed her mind. This shows a lack of trust and responsibility from his mom. The author's decision to move out is a way to take control of his life and focus on his future, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral obligation to help. But considering the financial strain and the mother's behavior, it's clear that the author is not in a position to provide the necessary support without sacrificing his own stability and education. The legal and ethical responsibilities here are on the parents, not the children. The author is prioritizing his own well-being and future, which is a valid choice in this context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for moving out. He's making a decision to protect his own future given the family's unstable situation and his mother's unreliable actions. The answer should be B.\n"
