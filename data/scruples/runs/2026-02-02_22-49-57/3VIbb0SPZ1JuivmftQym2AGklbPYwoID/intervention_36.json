I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong if they move out and leave their baby sister. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant, which added financial strain. The author had to help pay for an abortion, but then the mom changed her mind, used his money for baby stuff, and now he's considering moving out. The mom is accusing him of being selfish, but he feels overwhelmed and doesn't trust her.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author is an adult now, which gives him the right to make his own decisions. Moving out isn't illegal. The mom's actions, like using his money without consent, are problematic. She took $400 from his account and then spent it on baby items after he had already helped with the abortion. That's a breach of trust and possibly illegal, depending on the joint account terms.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is trying to protect his future. He's struggling in school, working, and saving for college. Taking on the responsibility of a sibling's child would be a huge burden. The mom's lack of financial responsibility and poor decision-making contribute to the situation. The author isn't abandoning the child; he's prioritizing his own well-being and future to avoid being trapped in a cycle of financial and emotional strain.\n\nHowever, there's a social expectation that family should support each other. But given the mom's history of poor decisions and the author's legitimate concerns about his future, his choice to move out seems justified. He's not ignoring the situation entirely; he's just choosing to focus on his own life to improve his circumstances. The mom should be responsible for her own decisions and their consequences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are a response to the mother's irresponsibility and his own need for stability. The answer should be B.\n"
