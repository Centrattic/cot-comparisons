I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting to refuse helping his sister and move out. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's background: his dad left when he was 3, he's not close with his mom, and they're both just barely making ends meet. He's working after school and trying to improve his grades for college. Then his mom gets pregnant, quits her job, and the boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts. She insists on keeping the baby but later changes her mind again, uses the author's money for baby items, and then claims it's the author's responsibility as a brother. The author feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's financial instability, the sudden change in her decision about the baby, the unauthorized use of the author's money, and the emotional pressure from the mother. The author is trying to take control of his life and education, which is important for his future.\n\nI need to consider family responsibilities versus personal well-being. The mother's actions have created financial strain and a lack of trust. The author is an adult now, and moving out could be a way to regain control. Legally, he's not obligated to support his sister, and emotionally, he's under a lot of stress. The mother's behavior seems manipulative and self-centered, not considering her son's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family comes first. But given the circumstances\u2014financial instability, past issues with trust, and the author's need to focus on education and future\u2014it seems reasonable for him to prioritize his own stability. He's providing reasons that are valid and practical. The mother's actions have contributed to the situation, so the author's decision to move out isn't selfish but a necessary step for his own growth and responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
