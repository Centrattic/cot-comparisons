I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving his sister behind. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's background: his dad left when he was 3, and he's not close with his mom. He's working, making more than his mom, but their finances are tight. He's in school with a 2.5 GPA, which isn't great but improving. He's saving for college. Then his mom announces a pregnancy, quits her job, and the boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts. The author and his mom argue, he helps pay for an abortion, but then she changes her mind, uses his money for baby stuff, and now he's considering moving out.\n\nSo, the main points here are the financial strain, lack of trust because his mom took money from his account before, and the stress of an unexpected pregnancy when they can't support another child. The author feels that his mom is shirking responsibility and expects him to take over, which he's not willing to do.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he's not a parent, so he's under no obligation to support his sister. But morally, it's more complicated. He might feel he's being selfish, but given the circumstances\u2014his own education, financial instability, and his mom's previous actions\u2014he's justified in wanting to move out. His mom's behavior, like using his money without permission and making a last-minute decision to keep the baby after initially aborting, shows poor judgment. The author is trying to take control of his life and focus on his future, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral duty to help, but given that he's not a parent and his own situation, it's a tough call. The mom's actions have contributed to the problem, so the author isn't entirely at fault. He's trying to protect his future and his financial stability. Moving out could allow him to focus on school and his own goals without being burdened by his mom's poor decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are a response to his mother's irresponsible behavior and his need to prioritize his own future. The answer should be B.\n"
