I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for moving out and leaving their baby sister after the events described. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom is pregnant again, which causes financial strain. They had to cover the abortion costs, but the mom spent the money on baby items and decided to keep the baby. The author is concerned about his own education and financial stability, and feels he can't support another child. He's planning to move out to focus on himself.\n\nSo, the main points are: the mom's decisions led to financial issues, she changed her mind about the abortion, and the author feels burdened. He's moving out to take care of his future. \n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. At 18, the author is an adult, and legally he's not obligated to support his sister. The mom's actions\u2014like taking money without consent\u2014show poor financial responsibility. The author has a right to prioritize his own well-being, especially since he's the one making more money and supporting the household. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of family responsibility. The author might feel guilty, but he's not the parent. The mother is the one who chose to have another child despite the financial instability. The author's move to move out is a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nThe mom's reaction and the boyfriend's behavior add to the stress. The author is protecting himself from being exploited. Moving out could be seen as a responsible decision to avoid being stuck in a cycle of supporting others without support in return. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent from the author. He's trying to focus on his education and future, which is a valid priority. The mother's actions, like changing her mind and spending his money, contributed to his decision. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex, but legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. He's an adult with the right to make his own choices. The mother needs to take responsibility for her actions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
