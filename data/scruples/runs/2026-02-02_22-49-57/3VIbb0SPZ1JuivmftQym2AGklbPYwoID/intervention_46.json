I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting to refuse helping his sister and move out. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's background: his dad left when he was 3, he's not close with his mom. They both barely manage financially. He's working, going to school with a 2.5 GPA but improving. His mom gets pregnant, quits her job, and the boyfriend is not supportive. The author helps pay for an abortion, but his mom uses his money for baby items and then decides to keep the baby. She spends his money without permission, even when he's an adult now. Now he wants to move out to focus on his life and not take on the parental responsibilities.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, trust issues, and the mother's decision-making. The author feels he can't trust his mom with money anymore after she drained his account for baby items despite his initial help with the abortion. He's also concerned about being burdened with supporting the baby, which would affect his education and job.\n\nThe mother's actions seem to contribute to the problem. She made a decision to abort but then changed her mind and used his money. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is understandable given the situation. Moving out might be a way to protect his own future. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, siblings aren't legally obligated to support each other financially unless specified. The author isn't in a position where he's being forced to help; he's choosing to set limits after being taken advantage of. His mom's behavior (spending his money without consent, changing plans) probably justifies his decision. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral duty to help. But given the mom's irresponsibility and the author's own struggles, it's more about self-preservation. The mother's initial decision to have the baby despite financial instability is also a factor here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. He's taking steps to secure his own future and avoid being exploited again. His actions are a response to the mother's past behavior and his own need to focus on his education and work. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
