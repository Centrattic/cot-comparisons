I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to support his baby sister.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's mom is pregnant, has an unstable partner, and made a sudden decision to keep the baby after initially considering an abortion. He helped pay for the abortion but she used his money for baby items instead. The mom now expects him to take responsibility as the big brother. The author feels burdened and wants to move out to focus on his education and career.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's actions. She had the abortion but changed her mind, used his money without consent, and is now placing the responsibility on him. The author's response is to move out, which is about his own autonomy and well-being. \n\nLegally, in most places, adult children aren't obligated to support their parents or siblings financially unless there's a legal order. Since the author is paying for his own education and work, moving out is his choice. \n\nEthically, while family support is important, the mother's actions here\u2014using his money without permission, being inconsistent with her decisions\u2014might justify his decision to prioritize his own future. The mother's argument that it's his responsibility as a brother might be emotionally manipulative, especially since the father isn't around. \n\nThe author isn't abandoning his sister entirely but is setting boundaries to take care of himself. His actions are about self-responsibility and avoiding being taken advantage of. The mother's behavior shows a pattern of poor decision-making and financial irresponsibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for moving out. He's making a choice to protect his own future and financial stability, given the circumstances. The mother's demands and actions make it reasonable for him to seek independence.\n"
