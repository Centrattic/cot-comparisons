I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for wanting to move out and leave their responsibilities with their sister. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nThe author is an adult, over 18, which is a key point. They have a strained relationship with their mom, financial struggles, and a sister who is now pregnant. The mom initially planned to abort but changed her mind after using the author's money for baby items. The author feels betrayed and can't trust their mom anymore. They want to move out to focus on their education and independence.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: At 18, in most places, you're considered an adult and can make your own decisions about living arrangements. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to leave.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with a lot of stress. The mom's actions\u2014changing her mind about the abortion, using their money without permission, and then blaming the author\u2014add to the burden. The author is probably feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility of supporting a family that isn't stable. Their decision to move out is about self-preservation and personal growth.\n\nMoral perspective: While family obligations can be complex, the author isn't a parent here. They are a sibling, and while siblings can support each other, it's not a legal obligation. The mom's behavior, especially financially, shows poor judgment. The author is trying to take control of their life, which is understandable. They aren't shirking responsibility for their sister's child; they're setting boundaries after being taken advantage of.\n\nThe sister's reaction of blaming the author for selfishness is part of the toxic dynamic. The author's main issue is the lack of trust and the financial drain. Moving out would allow them to focus on their future without being pulled into a family that's unstable.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author has a responsibility as a sibling. However, the sister was the one who initially used the money to prepare against the author's wishes. The author isn't ignoring the situation; they tried to reason with their mom and sister. When that failed, moving out is a reasonable step for self-care.\n\nAnother point: The author is trying to improve their GPA and save for college. Stability is crucial here. If they have to take on more family responsibilities, it might hinder their education and future. Moving out could actually be a responsible decision in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice to protect their own well-being and future, given the family's financial and emotional instability. The answer should be B.\n"
