I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this post is in the wrong for wanting to move out after his mom had the baby and then used his money. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot. His dad left when he was 3, and he's not very close with his mom. They both make enough to get by, but barely. He's working after school, trying to improve his grades and save for college. Then the rent goes up, so he needs a better job. His mom announces she's pregnant and quits her job because it's \"not good for the baby,\" which they can't afford. The author and his mom get into an argument, and he yells at her because they can't support another child. The boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts, but she insists on keeping the baby. The boyfriend leaves, and the mom decides to abort but then changes her mind again, uses the author's money for baby items, and now she's yelling at him for being selfish.\n\nThe author is considering moving out because he doesn't trust his mom anymore. The question is, is he in the wrong for doing that?\n\nLet me think about the key points. The mom made a promise to abort the baby after the author helped pay for the procedure, but then she changed her mind and spent his money on baby stuff. That's a big betrayal of trust. The author has to support himself now, and moving out would allow him to focus on school and his future. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, can the author be blamed for wanting to leave a toxic situation? He's an adult now, and his mom is acting irresponsibly, putting the family's financial stability at risk. The mom is using his money without permission, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to take control of his life and education, which is understandable. \n\nBut also, as a sibling, there's a sense of responsibility. However, in this case, the mom is the parent, and she's not handling the situation well. The author isn't the one who caused the pregnancy, so his responsibility isn't as clear. The mom is the one making decisions that affect the family's finances, and she's being inconsistent. The author is protecting his own future, which is a valid reason to move out. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to take care of himself and his future, especially after the mom broke his trust and put them in a worse financial position. Moving out seems like a reasonable step given the circumstances.\n"
