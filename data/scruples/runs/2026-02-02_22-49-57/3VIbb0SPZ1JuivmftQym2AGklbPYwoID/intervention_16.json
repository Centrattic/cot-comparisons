I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong if they leave their family after their mom made a decision that affected them.\n\nFirst, the author has a strained relationship with their mom. The dad left when they were young, and they're struggling financially. The mom got pregnant and initially decided to abort after the author helped pay for it. But then she changed her mind and used the money for baby items. The author feels taken advantage of and doesn't trust the mom with their money anymore. Now they want to move out to focus on school and work.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's right to their own money and their well-being. The mom made decisions without considering the author's financial stability, even after they had agreed to the abortion. The author is trying to take control of their future, which is understandable. Moving out could be a way to reduce stress and focus on education, which might be in their best interest.\n\nBut wait, is there any obligation to support a sibling? In many places, parents are legally responsible for their children until they're adults, but siblings typically aren't. The author isn't legally obligated to support the baby. Plus, the mom's actions seem to disregard the author's consent and financial help. The author was even a minor when their money was taken, which adds to the complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is abandoning family in need. But given the mom's behavior\u2014like using the money without permission and changing plans\u2014it's clear she's not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's main goal is to improve their own life and education, which is valid. They've tried to reason with the mom but haven't had success. So moving out is a self-preservation step.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own future and well-being, especially when the family dynamics are toxic and financially draining. The mom's actions don't justify the author staying if it's harming their prospects.\n"
