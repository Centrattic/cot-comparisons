I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is an older sibling whose mom is pregnant again. They were already struggling financially, with the author working and trying to improve their grades. The mom decided to get an abortion initially, but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The author helped pay for the abortion, but the mom used the money for baby items instead. Now the author is considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. The author is an adult, over 18, and has their own income. The mom is the parent, but she's making decisions that affect the entire household's stability. The author feels they can't trust their mom anymore, especially after the mom took money without permission before. Moving out seems like a way to take control of their life and focus on their education and future.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they can't handle the responsibility of supporting their mom's new child and want to prioritize their own well-being. The mom is expecting them to help raise the baby, but the author isn't in a position to do that. Legally, once the author is an adult, they aren't obligated to support siblings or parents unless there's a legal guardianship, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nThe mom's actions\u2014changing her mind about the abortion, using the author's money for baby items, and then yelling and blaming the author\u2014are problematic. The author's decision to move out is a response to feeling unsupported and overburdened. It's about setting boundaries and self-preservation. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't being selfish; they're trying to protect their own future. The mom's choices have created a situation where the author can't thrive. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave.\n"
