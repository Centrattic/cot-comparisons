I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is an older brother who's been trying to support his mom financially after their dad left. They both make just enough to get by. Then his mom gets pregnant with his sister, which causes a lot of stress. The mom initially wants to keep the baby, but the author and her boyfriend argue against it. The boyfriend leaves, and the mom decides to have an abortion, but the author helps pay for it. Then the mom spends all his money on baby stuff and changes her mind about the abortion. The author feels betrayed and wants to move out. The question is, is he in the wrong for doing that?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The author has a strained relationship with his mom. He's responsible for his own education and work, and the family's financial situation is tight. The mom's decision to have a baby without considering the financial impact adds to the stress. The author tried to reason with her, and she did abort the baby initially but then changed her mind. Then she took his money without permission, which he's used to but now can't take anymore.\n\nThe author is now 18 and has the means to move out. He feels he can't handle the responsibility of being a parent to his sister and wants to focus on his education. The key points here are consent, financial responsibility, and personal autonomy.\n\nThe mom is making a decision to have another child without considering the existing financial strain. The author has already supported himself and his mom, but now feels it's unfair to be burdened with a new sibling. In many cases, adult children are not legally obligated to support their parents or siblings, unless there's a court order or specific circumstances. The author is 18, so he's an adult now, and his decision to move out could be seen as his right to take control of his life.\n\nHowever, there's also the emotional aspect. The mom is his parent, and there might be cultural or personal expectations about family support. But the author has a history of his mom taking his money without permission, which adds to the tension. The fact that she changed her mind about the abortion and then spent his money on baby items without consent is a breach of trust.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong because he's an adult and can choose to leave. Ethically, it's more complex. He's prioritizing his own well-being and future. The mom's actions have been impulsive and financially irresponsible, which the author is now trying to avoid. So in this context, the author isn't in the wrong for moving out to protect his own interests and future.\n"
