I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for wanting to move out and leave their family, particularly after their mom had an abortion but then changed her mind and started buying baby stuff again. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is an adult now, turned 18, and has been dealing with their mom's financial irresponsibility. The mom initially decided to have an abortion with the help of the person's money, but then took the money and used it for baby items, changing her mind. The person felt they couldn't trust their mom anymore and moved out.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the person is supporting their family financially, the mom is making decisions that affect the household's stability, and there's a history of financial exploitation. The person is also focused on their education and future, which is important. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and responsibility. The person is an adult and has the right to make decisions about their own life, especially when it comes to their financial well-being and ability to pursue education. The mom's actions seem to be irresponsible, and the person is trying to take control of their situation. \n\nLegally, once someone is 18, they are adults and can make such decisions. Ethically, the person isn't wrong for wanting to protect their own future, especially when the family dynamics are harmful. The mom's behavior\u2014changing her mind, using the money without consent\u2014adds to the justification for moving out. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the person's mental health and ability to focus on school. Moving out could help them reduce stress and improve their academic performance. The argument that the mom needs support might be valid, but the person isn't in a position to provide that without compromising their own life.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the person isn't in the wrong. They are prioritizing their own future and well-being in a situation where they've been shouldering too much responsibility. The answer should be B (No).\n"
