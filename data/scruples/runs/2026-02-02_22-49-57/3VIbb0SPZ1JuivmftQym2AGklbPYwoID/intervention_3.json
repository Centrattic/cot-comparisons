I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support their sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom became pregnant, and the family was already struggling financially. The author, who is the older sibling, tried to reason with their mom about the financial burden, leading her to initially decide on an abortion. But then she changed her mind, kept the baby, and spent the author's money on baby items. The mom also has a history of taking small amounts from the joint account. The author feels they can't trust their mom anymore and wants to move out to focus on their education and future.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once the author turned 18, they are an adult and have the right to manage their own finances. The mom's actions of using the author's money without permission, especially after the author had set up a separate account, could be seen as a breach of trust. The author is within their rights to protect their money and their future.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with a lot of stress. The family's financial instability, the mom's decision to have another child despite the circumstances, and the history of financial misuse are all factors. The author's decision to move out is also about self-preservation and focusing on their education, which is a valid personal goal.\n\nThe mom's reaction, yelling about responsibility and selfishness, shows a lack of understanding of the author's perspective. Parents are supposed to be responsible, but in this case, the mom's actions are contributing to the family's instability. It's not the child's responsibility to support the parent's poor decisions. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to take control of their life and future despite the challenging circumstances. Moving out is a reasonable step to protect their well-being and education. So the answer should be B.\n"
