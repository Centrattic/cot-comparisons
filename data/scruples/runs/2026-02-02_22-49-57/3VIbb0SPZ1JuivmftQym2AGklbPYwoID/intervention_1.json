I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to help support their baby sister. \n\nFirst, the context: The author's mom gets pregnant, can't work, and initially decides to abort but then changes her mind. The author helped with the abortion cost but then found out the money was misused. The mom now expects him to support her new child, which he's not ready for. He's struggling with his own education and job, and moving out would help him focus.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's actions. She took the author's money without permission, lied about the baby's status, and is now placing the burden on him. The author has his own responsibilities and needs to focus on his future. The mom's behavior shows a lack of responsibility and reliability.\n\nLegally, parents are responsible for their children, but the author isn't the parent. He's being asked to take on financial obligations that aren't his legal responsibility. The mom is the parent here, so she should bear the costs of raising the child. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being and future, especially after the mom's previous actions have shown she can't be trusted with his resources.\n\nAlso, the author has a right to make decisions about his own life. Moving out isn't a selfish act in this context; it's about self-preservation and creating a stable environment for himself. The mom's reaction about it being his responsibility as a brother seems unfair because siblings aren't legally obligated to support each other in this way. The author isn't abandoning a child; he's avoiding being taken advantage of by a parent who isn't fulfilling her duties.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
