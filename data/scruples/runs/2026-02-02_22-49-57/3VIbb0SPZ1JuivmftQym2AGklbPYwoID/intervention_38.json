I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving his sister to handle his mom's new baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom is making a huge life decision to keep a baby despite financial instability. She initially decided to abort after the author helped pay for it, but then changed her mind and used his money on baby items. The author has a history of her taking small amounts from his joint account when he was a minor, so he's not trusting her now. He's also struggling with school and work, making him feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe author's main concerns are about being able to focus on his education and not being financially responsible for the new baby. He's planning to move out once he has the means. The question is whether this makes him selfish or if he's justified in wanting to take care of himself.\n\nLooking at the mother's actions: she's making a choice to have a baby without considering the existing financial strain. The author has legitimate reasons to feel that supporting another child isn't feasible for him right now. His past experiences with her misusing his money add to his distrust. Moving out could be a way to protect his own future.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that as a sibling, he has a moral obligation to help. But legally, siblings don't have that responsibility. The mother's actions seem to be placing an unfair burden on her son, especially given her own choices. The author is trying to prioritize his education and independence, which are important for his future.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't being selfish; he's making a practical decision to secure his own well-being. The mother's decisions have led to this conflict, and the author is taking steps to avoid being stuck in a cycle of financial and emotional strain. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
