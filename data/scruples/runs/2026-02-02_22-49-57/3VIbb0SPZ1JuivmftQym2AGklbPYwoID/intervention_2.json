I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for refusing to support his sister and moving out. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a pregnancy, and the boyfriend didn't want to support the baby, so she considered an abortion. The author helped pay for the abortion, but then his mom changed her mind and kept the baby. She used the money he gave her for the abortion to buy baby stuff, which he found out when he came home. Then she screamed at him, saying he needs to help raise the kid because it's his responsibility as a big brother. He feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and work.\n\nHmm. So the author is in a tough spot. His mom is making decisions that affect their financial stability, and he's trying to take control of his own finances. He's also concerned about supporting a baby he didn't want and can't afford. The key points here are about responsibility, trust, and personal boundaries.\n\nThe mother's actions seem to be adding more stress to the author. She initially wanted an abortion but then changed her mind, which left the author with the burden. He's also had past issues where his mom took money from his account without permission. Now he's an adult and wants to move out to avoid being responsible for the baby and to focus on his future. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, does the author have a right to move out? Well, he's an adult, and once he turns 18, he's legally an adult. He's trying to take responsibility for his own life, especially given his mom's unstable decisions. The mother is acting as a parent, but she's making choices that don't consider the son's well-being or financial situation. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to create boundaries to protect himself, especially when the mother is not considering his input or financial stability. \n\nThe mother's argument that it's the author's responsibility as a big brother is a stretch. Siblings don't have legal obligations to support each other's children unless there's a specific situation like custody. The author isn't a parent, so it's unreasonable to expect him to take on that role. He's also trying to improve his education and his own future, which is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a decision to prioritize his own life and well-being after being let down by his mother's actions. The answer should be B.\n"
