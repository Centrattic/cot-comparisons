I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for wanting to move out and leave their baby sister. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant with an unemployed boyfriend. They were already struggling financially. The mom initially wanted to abort but then changed her mind after the author helped with the abortion cost. The mom used the author's money to buy baby items instead of following through with the abortion. The author has a low GPA but is trying to improve and save for college. They feel their mom is irresponsible and might leave the parenting duties to them. The author is considering moving out to focus on their education and independence.\n\nHmm, the key points here are financial responsibility, parental responsibility, and the author's own future. The author is trying to take control of their finances after previous issues with their mom accessing their joint account. They feel that by moving out, they can avoid being burdened with the new sibling's care and financial needs. \n\nBut wait, is it the author's responsibility to support their sister? Legally, as a sibling, there's no obligation unless there's some sort of court order, but in family dynamics, it's more of a moral question. The mom is the parent, so the primary responsibility lies with her. The author has already tried to reason with her, but the mom's actions (using the money for baby items, changing her mind about the abortion) show inconsistency and irresponsibility. \n\nThe author is also in a position where they can support themselves now, which is a sign of responsibility. They want to focus on their education and future. Moving out might be a way to set boundaries, especially after the mom's behavior. However, leaving a younger sibling and a parent in a tough spot could be seen as abandonment, but the author is not the parent. The parent's choices are leading to this situation, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take care of their own needs.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a sibling, the author has a moral duty to help, especially since the mom is failing. But others might say that the author has already done their part by helping with the abortion and tried to reason with the mom. The mom's actions (draining funds, not listening) make it clear she's not reliable. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to take control of their life and future, especially after the mom's irresponsible behavior. They can't be held responsible for the mom's choices. So the answer should be B.\n"
