I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a young person dealing with their family's financial struggles. They mention that they and their mom are just making ends meet. The dad left when the author was 3, so the family's financial burden is on the mom and the author. The author is working after school and trying to improve their grades for college, but with a 2.5 GPA, they're not doing great academically. \n\nThen the mom gets pregnant and quits her job, which adds more financial strain. The author and their boyfriend (the unemployed one) are already struggling, and the mom's decision to have a baby would make things worse. The boyfriend initially pushes for an abortion but leaves after the mom insists on keeping the baby. The author tried to reason with the mom about the financial implications, and the mom agreed to an abortion, but then spent the money meant for the procedure on baby items and decided to keep the baby instead. \n\nThe mom then accuses the author of being selfish for not trusting her with money, which the author is justified in, given past instances where the mom took money without consent. The author, now 18, moved the money to a separate account, and now feels the mom is trying to dump parenting responsibilities on them. They're considering moving out to focus on their education and financial independence.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by moving out. \n\nLet's look at the key points. The author is trying to support their education and future. They have a right to their own money, especially after the mom's previous actions. The mom made a decision that directly affects the household's finances without considering the author's input, despite the author's warnings. The author's refusal to support the baby further isn't out of a lack of responsibility, but because they can't afford it and need to prioritize their own future. Moving out is a way to take control of their life, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, family responsibilities can be a factor. However, the author's situation is that their mom isn't acting in the best interest of the family's stability. The mom changing her mind about the abortion and spending the money on baby items shows poor decision-making, and the author is protecting their own resources. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish in refusing to support a choice that the mom made recklessly, especially when it's against the author's own financial goals. Moving out is a personal decision, and the author has the means to do so. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
