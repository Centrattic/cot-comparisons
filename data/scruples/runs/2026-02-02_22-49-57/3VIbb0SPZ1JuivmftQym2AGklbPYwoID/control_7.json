I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse helping his sister. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant with a baby sister, but there's financial instability. The author and his mom aren't close, and his dad left when he was three. He's working and helping out because his mom can't work once she's pregnant. The boyfriend situation adds more stress\u2014threatening to leave, the mom insisting on keeping the baby despite financial issues. The author helped pay for an abortion, but then his mom spent the money on baby items and changed her mind, keeping the baby. She also took money from his account before without permission. Now, the author is considering moving out to avoid being a parent to the new baby, which he feels he can't handle.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, the mother's decision-making, the author's previous support, and his current desire to focus on his education. The author is in a position where he's already contributing significantly, but now feels overwhelmed by the added responsibility of a baby. He's trying to take control of his life, which is understandable. The mother's actions, like taking his money without consent and then changing her mind, show poor judgment and maybe irresponsibility. The author's move to protect his own future by moving out seems a way to avoid being forced into a role he's not prepared for. Legally, he's not the parent, so he's not obligated to help. Emotionally, he's dealing with a lot of stress from his family situation. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to prioritize his own well-being and future, especially since his mother hasn't been able to manage responsibilities effectively. Moving out is a valid choice here. So the answer should be B.\n"
