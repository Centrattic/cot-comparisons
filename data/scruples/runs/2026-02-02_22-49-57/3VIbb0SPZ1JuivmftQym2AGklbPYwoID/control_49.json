I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant, and the family was already struggling financially. The author and his mom are the main income sources, and their rent increased. The mom initially wanted to keep the baby, then an abortion, then changed her mind again. The author helped pay for the abortion but found out the money was used for baby items instead. The mom took money from the joint account without permission before, and now the author is considering moving out because he doesn't trust her anymore and wants to focus on his education and job.\n\nSo, the main points here are financial responsibility, trust issues, and the author's own well-being. The mom made decisions that affected the family's stability, and the author feels neglected and unsupported. He's trying to save for college and improve his grades. Moving out would allow him to focus on his future without the added stress of supporting a new sibling.\n\nBut wait, is it right for him to abandon his family? The mom is his parent, and the baby is his sister. However, the author mentions that he was a minor when the joint account was in place and that he's now 18, so he's an adult. The financial responsibilities and the mom's actions have been causing stress. The author isn't being selfish; he's trying to take control of his life. He's also pointing out that the mom didn't follow through on her commitments, like using the abortion funds for the procedure instead of baby items.\n\nThe mom's reaction, screaming and accusing him of being selfish, might be valid in a way if she feels he's abandoning his family. But given her history of making poor financial decisions and not respecting his money, the author's decision to move out could be seen as protecting his own future. He's not refusing to support his baby sister entirely but is choosing to prioritize his own stability, which is a reasonable choice for an adult in this situation.\n\nI think the key here is the author's responsibility versus his personal well-being. Since he's an adult, he has the right to make decisions about his own life and future. The mom's actions have been unreliable, so his move to leave might be justified as a way to avoid further financial strain and to focus on his education and career. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
