I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who's dealing with their mom getting pregnant again, leading to a lot of stress and financial strain. The mom initially decided to abort the baby but then changed her mind and spent the author's money on baby items. The author is considering moving out because they can't handle the situation anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities and rights of both the author and their mom. The author is an adult now, having turned 18, and they've been supporting the family financially. The mom, on the other hand, is making decisions that impact the family's stability. The author's main concern is that they can't trust their mom with their money and feel burdened by the new responsibilities of a sibling.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong if they are making a choice to take care of their own well-being. They've been contributing financially, and if the mom is making decisions that put the family in a worse financial position, the author might be justified in prioritizing their own life. Moving out could allow them to focus on education and work without the added stress. However, there's a societal expectation of sibling support, but the author might not be obligated to take on parental responsibilities for their mom's child if they feel it's unfair or unsustainable.\n\nAlso, the mom's actions\u2014like using the author's money without permission and then changing her mind about the abortion\u2014show a lack of responsibility. The author's decision to move out could be seen as self-preservation rather than selfishness. The key here is whether the author is acting out of self-interest or trying to protect their future. Since they mention wanting to focus on education and reduce work hours, it's more about personal growth and stability.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They're making a tough choice to secure their own future in a situation where the parent isn't making responsible decisions, and they've already tried to reason with their mom without success.\n"
