I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a person considering moving out after their mom had an abortion but then changed her mind and used his money for baby items. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for potentially moving out.\n\nFirst, the author's mom made a decision to abort the baby after the author helped pay for the procedure. But then she switched to keeping the baby, using his money for baby stuff without permission. The author has been supporting the family financially, even contributing to the abortion, but now feels betrayed because the money was taken without consent. The mom is now demanding he help raise the baby, which he can't handle given his current circumstances.\n\nThe author's main arguments are about financial responsibility and trust. He's been saving for college, has a job, and is struggling to keep up with school. His mom's actions have made him lose trust, and he feels he can't support another child. Moving out seems like a way to focus on his future and not be burdened by a parent he doesn't trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might argue that as a parent, she has the right to make decisions about her body and family. However, she's also been irresponsible with finances and didn't consider the author's position. The author has been helping, but the mom's actions\u2014using money without permission and not following through on her initial decision\u2014add to the tension.\n\nThe key points here are about consent (using his money without permission), financial responsibility, and the author's need to prioritize his own future. The author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his resources and setting boundaries after being wronged. The mom's behavior seems manipulative and self-centered, which justifies the author's decision to move out. So, the answer should be B.\n"
