I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is considering moving out because their mom is pregnant again, and they feel overwhelmed by the financial and emotional stress. Their mom initially decided to abort the baby after their arguments about not being able to support another child, but then changed her mind and used the brother's money for baby items. The brother had given money for the abortion, which was then used for baby stuff, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the brother's main issue is that he doesn't want to take on the responsibility of another child. His mom is unemployed, and the dad left when he was three. The family's finances are tight, and the brother is trying to save for college while improving his grades. The mother's actions\u2014changing her mind about the abortion and using his money without permission\u2014have made him feel betrayed and untrustworthy of his parent's decisions.\n\nThe key points here are his responsibility as a family member versus his personal well-being. He's an adult now, having turned 18, and is taking steps to secure his future by saving money and focusing on his education. Moving out seems like a way to regain control and protect his resources. The mother's argument that it's his responsibility as a big brother might be seen as placing undue pressure on him, especially since he's already struggling with his own situation.\n\nFinancially, the brother has enough to move out, which suggests he's taking proactive steps. The mother's previous behavior of taking money without consent and then changing her mind about the abortion shows inconsistency. The brother's decision to cut ties could be seen as self-preservation rather than selfishness. He's not abandoning his sister necessarily but trying to prioritize his own stability and future, which is a valid consideration.\n\nHowever, there's a moral aspect here. Family responsibilities can be complex. But given the mother's actions and the brother's need to focus on his education and financial independence, it's understandable that he wants out. The line between selfishness and self-respect is thin here. The mother's insistence that it's his responsibility might not take into account his contributions and the existing financial strain.\n\nIn conclusion, while the brother might feel guilty, his decision isn't inherently wrong. He's an adult with his own life to build, and the family's circumstances don't support another child. His actions are more about protecting his future than being selfish.\n"
