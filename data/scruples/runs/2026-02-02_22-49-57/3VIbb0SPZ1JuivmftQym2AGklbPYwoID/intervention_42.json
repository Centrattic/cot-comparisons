I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support his baby sister. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant and initially considered an abortion, which the author helped pay for. But then she changed her mind, spent the author's money on baby items, and now the author is upset. He's been saving to move out because he can't trust his mom anymore. The mom is upset with him for not supporting the baby, but the author feels he can't handle the responsibility.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, once the author is 18, he's an adult and can move out. Parents aren't obligated to support their adult children, nor are adult children obligated to support their parents financially. So the author isn't legally in the wrong for moving out. \n\nMoral-wise, the author is in a tough spot. His mom made decisions without considering his input and misused his money. The author has his own struggles with school and work. He's trying to save for college and improve his GPA. It seems like he's doing what he can to better himself, and the mom's actions are adding stress. \n\nThe key points are the mom's irresponsibility, financial exploitation, and the author's need to focus on his education. The author isn't being selfish; he's trying to protect his future. The mom's expectation that he should help raise the baby seems unfair, especially after her actions. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's prioritizing his well-being and future, which is reasonable given the circumstances. The mom's choices have led to this situation, and the author isn't obligated to support her. Moving out is a valid decision here.\n"
