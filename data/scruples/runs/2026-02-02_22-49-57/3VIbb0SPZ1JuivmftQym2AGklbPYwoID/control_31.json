I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for refusing to support his sister and moving out. \n\nFirst, the situation: the friend and his mom are struggling financially. His dad left when he was 3, and they're barely making ends meet. The mom gets pregnant, tells the boyfriend about the pregnancy, and he threatens to leave unless she aborts. She insists on keeping the baby. The boyfriend leaves. The mom initially agrees to abort but then changes her mind, spends the friend's money on baby stuff, and now the friend is considering moving out.\n\nThe key points here are the financial burden. The friend has a part-time job, but with rent increases and school, he's already stressed. The mom's decision to have the baby without considering their financial situation seems to add more pressure. The friend has a right to his own financial independence, especially after the mom has taken his money before without consent. \n\nThe mother's reaction is also problematic. She accuses him of being selfish when he's trying to protect his future. The friend is trying to focus on education and save for college, which is a valid priority. Moving out to avoid being a financial burden might be a responsible decision for him.\n\nHowever, there's a family dynamic here. The mother is the parent, and the father is absent. The friend might feel a responsibility as the older brother, but he's not legally obligated to support the baby. His main responsibility is to his own well-being and future. The mother's actions have been impulsive and self-centered, which the friend is reacting to.\n\nSo, weighing the situation, the friend isn't in the wrong for moving out. He's making a choice to protect his future and independence, especially after the mother's inconsistent decisions and misuse of his money. The answer should be B.\n"
