I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an older brother whose mom is pregnant with his baby sister. The mom initially wanted to abort, but then changed her mind. The author helped pay for the abortion but the mom took all the money he had, used it on baby items, and then started demanding he help raise the baby. Now the author is considering moving out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's family situation is already strained. The dad left when he was 3, so he's had to support the family financially. He's working, in school, and trying to save for college. The mom's sudden pregnancy adds to the stress. The boyfriend wanted her to abort, but she insisted on keeping it. Then when the author helped pay, the mom changed her mind again, used the money for baby stuff, and is now blaming the author for being selfish.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. He's trying to take care of himself and his education, and the mom is making demands on him. The key points here are whether the author has a responsibility to support his mother and the baby, and if moving out is a reasonable action given the circumstances.\n\nLegally, in most places, once a child is 18, they aren't obligated to support their parents financially unless there's a court order or some other obligation. So the author isn't legally wrong to move out. Emotionally and morally, it's more complex. The author is trying to save his own future. His mom's actions, like taking his money without permission and then changing her decision, might make him feel that he can't rely on her, especially after years of instability (like the dad leaving, financial struggles).\n\nThe mom's response, yelling that it's his responsibility as a big brother, might not hold water because being a big brother doesn't legally obligate him to financial support. However, in some family dynamics, there's an expectation of support. But given that the mom is an adult and the author is trying to support himself, it's a question of whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing his own needs.\n\nThe author tried to reason with his mom, gave her the option to abort with his financial help, but she went back on her word, which could be a breach of trust. The author has a right to protect his resources, especially since he's saving for college and his future. Moving out could be a way to set boundaries and take control of his life, which is important for his well-being and educational goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as abandoning his family in a time of need. However, considering the mom's previous actions (taking money without consent, inconsistent decisions), the author might feel that moving out is a necessary step to protect himself. There's also the aspect of the author's own mental health and ability to focus on school without the added stress of supporting a new sibling financially.\n\nIn summary, while there's an argument that the author is being selfish, given the circumstances and the mom's behavior, the author might be justified in moving out to focus on his future and well-being. The key here is the mom's responsibility versus the author's. Since the author is an adult and the mom is an adult who made an impulsive decision, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
