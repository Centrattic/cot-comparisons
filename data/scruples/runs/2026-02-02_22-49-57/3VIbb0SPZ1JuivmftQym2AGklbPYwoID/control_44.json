I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and leave his baby sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant, which causes financial strain. The author and his mom were struggling financially even before, and now with the rent increase and his mom quitting her job, things look worse. The mom initially decides to abort the baby but then changes her mind and keeps the child, using the author's money that was meant for the abortion. The author has had previous issues with his mom taking money from his account without permission. Now, he's considering moving out to avoid being responsible for the baby and his mom's poor decisions.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about responsibility and personal boundaries. The author is trying to take care of his own future, focusing on education and stability. His mom made a decision to have the baby without considering the financial implications, and she's using his resources. The author has a right to protect his own financial security, especially since he's already contributing more than he can afford. \n\nBut wait, is moving out the right thing to do? The mom is claiming it's her choice to have the baby, so the author might feel he's abandoning his sister. However, given the circumstances, if the author can support himself, maybe he's not obligated to take care of his sister. The mom's actions have been irresponsible, and the author is trying to avoid a cycle of dependency. \n\nOn the other hand, as a sibling, there might be a moral responsibility, but the author's well-being and future are also important. The mom's boyfriend situation adds more chaos, and the author is trying to escape that environment. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's making a decision to prioritize his own life and stability, especially since his mom isn't managing her responsibilities. Moving out could help him focus on his education and career. The mother's actions have been self-centered, and the author has a right to set boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
