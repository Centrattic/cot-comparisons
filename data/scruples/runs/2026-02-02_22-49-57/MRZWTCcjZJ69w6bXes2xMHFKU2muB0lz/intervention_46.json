Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which the fianc\u00e9e is upset about. The author argues it's their house and the bonus is \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9e is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author owns the house outright, inherited from their grandmother, and has the legal right to modify it. They used a bonus that might not recur again. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The project is causing significant disruption to their living situation, leading her to move out.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bonus was a one-time opportunity, so using it for a personal project is justified. The fianc\u00e9e feels it's irresponsible and that major home modifications should be discussed as a couple, especially since they're planning to get married. The root issue seems to be a disagreement over financial priorities and communication.\n\nI need to consider whether the author's actions are wrong. Legally, they have the right to modify the house. Emotionally and relationally, using a large one-time bonus for a personal project without considering their partner's perspective might be the problem. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about financial planning and shared decision-making in a committed relationship might be valid. Even if the author owns the house, major projects that affect both partners' lives should probably be discussed together. The fact that the project is causing her to move out and consider ending the engagement suggests a significant breach in communication and mutual respect. The author might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings and for making a unilateral decision that impacts the relationship so deeply.\n"
