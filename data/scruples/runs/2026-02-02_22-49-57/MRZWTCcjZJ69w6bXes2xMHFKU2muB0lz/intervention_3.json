Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author using a bonus to build a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author got a job after being out of steady work for years and received a five-figure bonus. They used this bonus to hire a contractor to build a secret room in the house they own. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The conflict escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved out and is considering ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's financial independence, the use of a bonus (which they might see as \"found money\"), the ownership of the house, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus was a one-time opportunity and that since they own the house, they have the right to do what they want with it. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that major home renovations without discussion are irresponsible, especially considering their shared plans for the future (marriage, wedding costs, etc.).\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a relationship, especially when two people are planning to get married. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations can affect both partners, not just the owner. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about financial planning and shared responsibilities. The author might have thought they were making a personal investment, but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a disregard for their shared financial goals.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a financial perspective, using a bonus for a personal project instead of shared expenses can be seen as selfish, even if the bonus is considered \"extra.\" In relationships, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions often require discussion and compromise. The fact that the author went ahead with the project without consulting their fianc\u00e9, leading to significant stress and potential relationship breakdown, suggests a lack of communication and consideration.\n\nOwnership of the house is on the author's side, but the renovation is causing the fianc\u00e9 to be unable to live there. This complicates things because they're a couple living in the same house. The author's unilateral decision might have ignored the other person's needs and the partnership aspect of the relationship.\n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, bonuses can be unpredictable. However, using a large portion of it for a luxury project (a secret room) when there are other pressing financial obligations (wedding, debt) might be seen as irresponsible. The fianc\u00e9's arguments are valid in that context.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to renovate their own property, the social and relational aspects are where the issue lies. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author's actions, while not illegal, may have been inconsiderate of their partner's feelings and the shared future they were planning.\n\nTherefore, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the project with their fianc\u00e9, especially given the significant financial impact and the disruption caused to their partner's life. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
