Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who took their bonus to build a secret room is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's upset about the financial decision and the disruptions to their home.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus, which they describe as \"found money.\" They used it for a personal project they wanted. The key points here are ownership of the house and the financial implications. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. That means they have legal rights to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they were planning to use the money for other purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings.\n\nThe author argues it's their money and house, so they have every right to use it as they see fit. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major home renovations are making life difficult. The conflict here is between personal desires and shared financial planning. \n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions often require discussion and compromise. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before spending the bonus, which is a significant factor. Even though the house is their own, the project is causing stress and possibly impacting the fianc\u00e9's quality of life. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Legally, they're not in the wrong, but morally or relationally, it's debatable. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because major financial decisions should involve the partner, especially when considering marriage. The author's disregard for the fianc\u00e9's concerns and the impact on their relationship could be seen as the issue here. So, while the author isn't breaking any laws, their approach might be considered inconsiderate or selfish in the context of their relationship.\n"
