Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author received a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they can make modifications. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus was used for a personal project instead of shared financial goals like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and the project has made the house uninhabitable for her.\n\nThe main issue here is financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. Even though the author has the legal right to use their bonus as they see fit, relationships often require compromise and discussion about shared goals. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a significant financial decision that affects their shared living space. This lack of communication could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns and priorities, which are valid in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married. \n\nWhile the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspects suggest that not discussing major financial decisions with a partner, especially one they're engaged to, can be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, though extreme, is a response to feeling disregarded. The project's impact on their living situation adds to the tension. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the key issue is the failure to communicate and consider the partner's perspective despite being in a committed relationship.\n"
