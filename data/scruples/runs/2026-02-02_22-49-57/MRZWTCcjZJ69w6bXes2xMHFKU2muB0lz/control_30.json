Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a rift with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to go towards shared goals like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The argument got so bad she moved out and they're considering breaking up.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author sees the bonus as a one-time opportunity to do something fun. The fianc\u00e9 views it as irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations can affect the entire household, especially when living together. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels her input wasn't considered is a big deal. Relationships often require compromise and discussing finances together. The author didn't consult with the fianc\u00e9 before making a significant financial decision that impacts their shared living space. That lack of communication and consideration for each other's priorities might be the root of the problem. Even though the author has the legal right to make changes, relationships involve mutual respect and shared planning. So, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the decision with their fianc\u00e9 and not considering her perspective, especially regarding their future together.\n"
