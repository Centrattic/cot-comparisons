Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a big bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which they've always wanted. They own the house outright since it was given by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible, especially since they could have used the money for debts, the wedding, or savings. She's even moved in with her sister and might call off the wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to their bonus, their ownership of the house, and the fianc\u00e9's perspective on financial responsibility. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a shared responsibility since they're getting married.\n\nHmm. Legally, the author owns the house and the bonus is their income, so they have the right to spend it. But relationships involve compromise. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a major decision that affects their shared living space. Even though it's their house, a significant renovation like this impacts both partners, especially when they're planning to get married. The fianc\u00e9 might feel disrespected or excluded from financial decisions that affect their future together.\n\nThe author's argument that it's \"found money\" is valid, but in a committed relationship, big financial decisions usually require discussion. The secret room project caused her to leave the house, which is a serious consequence. Even if the author has the legal right to do this, the social and relational aspect is where the issue lies. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and savings are also valid, especially if they had prior agreements or expectations about financial planning post-marriage.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the relational aspect shows a lack of communication and consideration. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve their partner in the decision, leading to significant conflict. However, some might argue it's not their fault since it's their money and house. But given the context of a marriage plan, the shared financial responsibilities, and the impact on the relationship, the answer is likely A.\n"
