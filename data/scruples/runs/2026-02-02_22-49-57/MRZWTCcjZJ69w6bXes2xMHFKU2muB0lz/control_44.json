Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a big bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, started digging into the house's foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and now they're considering breaking off the engagement. The house was given to the author by their grandma, and they own it outright. But the fianc\u00e9 feels like this decision was made without considering their shared future plans.\n\nHmm. The key points here might be communication and shared financial planning. Even though the author owns the house, a major renovation with significant costs should probably be discussed with a partner, especially since they're engaged and planning to marry. The fianc\u00e9 mentions using the money for debt, the wedding, or savings, which are common financial priorities for couples. The author's argument is that the bonus is a one-time thing and they wanted to use it for something fun. But the fact that the work is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. \n\nEven if the author has legal authority over the house, relationships often require compromise and mutual agreement on major financial decisions. Not discussing such a large project with their fianc\u00e9 could be seen as selfish, especially since they're planning to get married. So maybe the author did overstep by not including their partner in the decision, leading to the fianc\u00e9 feeling disrespected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings and financial priorities.\n"
