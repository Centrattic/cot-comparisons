Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took their bonus to build a secret room is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who's upset about the financial decision and the disruption to their home.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright since it was given to them by their grandmother. So legally, they have the right to modify it. The bonus is considered \"found money,\" which they argue is a one-time opportunity. However, their fianc\u00e9e feels this was irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married and this could have been a joint financial decision.\n\nThe key points here are ownership of the property and shared financial responsibilities in a relationship. While the author has legal authority over the house, relationships often require mutual agreement on major expenses, especially when a wedding is involved. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is considering calling off the wedding suggests a significant breach of trust or communication. The author might not have considered their partner's perspective, leading to conflict. Even though they own the house, the financial implications (like using the bonus for a secret room instead of shared goals) might have been a mistake. The disruption caused by construction also affects their living situation. So, while the author isn't necessarily at legal fault, the relational aspect might mean they're in the wrong for not discussing the plan with their fianc\u00e9e first.\n"
