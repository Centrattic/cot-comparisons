Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using a bonus to create a secret room, causing a rift with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. The argument here is about responsibility and priorities. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for bills, wedding expenses, or paying off debts. The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" and wants to use it for a fun project.\n\nNow, considering the relationship aspect. They've been engaged for two years. Major financial decisions should ideally be discussed together, even if the author owns the house. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the engagement shows how serious this is. The secret room project is causing practical issues too\u2014digging into the foundation and tearing walls, making the house hard to live in. \n\nThe author argues it's their house, but in a committed engagement, financial decisions that impact the living situation of the partner should be mutual. The bonus might be unexpected, but using it on a personal project without consulting the fianc\u00e9 could be seen as selfish, especially when the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns about shared financial goals. \n\nEven though the author has the legal right, relationships require compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's lack of communication and consideration might have contributed to this conflict. The key here is whether the author considered the fianc\u00e9's perspective and shared financial planning before making such a significant investment in a personal project.\n"
