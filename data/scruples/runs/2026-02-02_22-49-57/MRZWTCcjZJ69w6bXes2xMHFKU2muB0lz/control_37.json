Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thought they should have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. She's so upset that she moved in with her sister and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and they have the right to use their own money as they see fit. They also mention that the house is their own property, given by their grandma, so they have legal authority to modify it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author did use their own bonus, which isn't illegal, but they didn't consider their fianc\u00e9e's financial expectations. Since they're engaged, financial decisions might require mutual agreement, especially when it involves major home renovations that affect both. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e didn't agree and is now a lot of stress suggests a breakdown in communication and planning. The author might not be legally wrong, but ethically, they could be at fault for not discussing the bonus usage beforehand. Major projects, even with one's own money, can impact the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme, but her concerns about financial priorities might be valid. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared financial goals in the engagement.\n"
