Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for a while. They used that money to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright because it was their grandma's. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning a wedding and she had other financial priorities. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they should enjoy it while they can. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is so angry she's moved out and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and respect in a relationship. The author owned the house and had legal authority, so technically, they can do what they want with it. But the problem isn't just about legality\u2014it's about the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e wasn't consulted, and the project is causing major stress. Even though the money was the author's bonus, using it on a big project without discussing it with a partner, especially one they're planning to marry, can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author might not be legally wrong, but relationship-wise, not involving the fianc\u00e9e in such a significant financial decision is a big issue. The fact that the project is making it impossible for the fianc\u00e9e to live in the house adds to the problem. So, even if the author had the right to use their money as they wished, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and priorities could make them the asshole here. The answer is probably A, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The author's justification about \"found money\" is a bit of a stretch since bonuses are part of their income. Also, the project's impact on their home and the wedding planning is significant. Yeah, I think A is the right choice.\n"
