Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus from a job they had after being out of steady work. They used this money for a personal project. The key points here are ownership of the house\u2014the author owns it outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, they're engaged, so there's a shared life aspect here. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for other purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again.\n\nNow, considering the relationship aspect. Even though the author has the legal right to modify the house, relationships involve mutual discussions about finances. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a significant decision. The project caused the house to be uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading her to move out. This seems like a major disruption. While the bonus was personal income, in a committed relationship, especially pre-marriage, financial decisions can affect both partners. The author's argument about using the bonus for fun is valid, but not discussing it with the fianc\u00e9 first led to conflict. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the relationship shows the severity of the issue. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and relationally, they may have mishandled the situation by not involving their partner in the decision-making process. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly, leading to significant relationship strain.\n"
