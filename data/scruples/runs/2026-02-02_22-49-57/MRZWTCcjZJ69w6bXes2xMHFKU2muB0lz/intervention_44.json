Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has led to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after years of being unemployed and received a five-figure bonus. The bonus is considered \"found money\" because it's a one-time thing. They decided to use it for a secret room project, which is their personal dream. They own the house outright, so they have legal authority to modify it. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the bonus should have been used for more responsible purposes like paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. She feels the project is irresponsible and has made the house uninhabitable, leading her to move out and consider ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author had the financial means (bonus) to fund the project, which they owned the house for. However, financial decisions in a relationship, especially when planning to marry, usually require mutual discussion. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 and proceeded unilaterally, causing significant strain. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and the impact on their shared future (wedding, debt) are valid. \n\nEven though the author had the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The secret room is a personal desire, but the fianc\u00e9's perspective is about shared financial planning and responsibility. The author's actions might be seen as self-indulgent without considering the partner's needs and future commitments. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for using their own money for a personal project, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns could be seen as the issue here. The fact that they got to the point of the fianc\u00e9 threatening to call off the wedding suggests that the author's decision, while perhaps not illegal or unethical, might be inconsiderate in the context of a committed relationship.\n"
