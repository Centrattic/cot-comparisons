Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used it to build a secret room, hiring a contractor to dig into the foundation. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's irresponsible and they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt, the wedding, etc. She's even moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's right to use their bonus as they see fit, the impact on the relationship, and the fianc\u00e9's perspective. The author argues the bonus is \"found money\" and their house. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, leading to significant stress and possible financial strain.\n\nNow, thinking about ownership and financial responsibility. Since the bonus is the author's personal income, they do have the right to spend it. However, they're engaged, and major financial decisions might require mutual agreement, especially if it affects shared living space. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 didn't agree and is now considering ending the engagement suggests that communication was lacking. The author might have assumed they could make the decision alone since it's their house, but relationships often require considering each other's priorities and financial planning together.\n\nAlso, the project is causing physical changes to the house that make it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there. That's a significant issue. Even if the money is the author's, altering the home in a way that affects both partners' daily lives without discussion could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9 might feel her concerns were ignored, leading to the breakdown in the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not discussing the use of the bonus and the project with their fianc\u00e9. While they have the legal right to their money and the house, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions that impact both partners should ideally be discussed. The author's actions led to a serious rift, which suggests they didn't consider their partner's feelings and priorities enough. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and considered the project's impact on their fianc\u00e9.\n"
