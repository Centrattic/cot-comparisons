Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who took their bonus to create a secret room is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a few years. They wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door and a staircase to a basement. They own the house outright, so legally they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 is really upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that they should have used the money for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The argument got so bad she moved in with her sister and might call off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the use of the bonus money and the impact on the relationship. The author sees the bonus as a one-time opportunity to do something fun. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it should be used for more practical purposes. The author owns the house, so the structural changes are their legal right. But in a relationship, especially when engaged, financial decisions can be a big deal.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Legally, they're not because it's their house and their bonus. But emotionally and relationally, maybe they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's feelings. Even though the author owns the home, the fianc\u00e9 is living there and the construction made it hard for her to live in the house. The author did a significant project without discussing it, which might be the main issue. The bonus being \"found\" money is a defense, but shared partners often expect joint financial planning, especially for major expenses. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows it's a serious problem. \n\nSo the author might not be the asshole in terms of legal rights, but in a relationship context, big financial decisions without consulting the partner can be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are practical. The secret room is a personal desire, but the impact on their relationship and the partner's well-being is significant. The author could have at least discussed the idea with the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, even if it was their own money. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while they have the legal right, the relationship aspect requires communication and mutual respect in financial matters, which seems to be missing here.\n"
