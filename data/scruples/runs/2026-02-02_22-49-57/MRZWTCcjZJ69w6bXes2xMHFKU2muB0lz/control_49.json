Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being unemployed for a while, and then received a five-figure bonus. They decided to use that bonus to build this secret room. The house they own outright because it was inherited from their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the money was wasted when it could have been used for more practical things like paying off debt or covering wedding costs. She's even moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are consent and communication. The author mentions that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for something fun. But since it's a shared life with a fianc\u00e9, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even though the house is the author's, the scale of the project (tearing down walls, digging up the foundation) affects the entire house, which the fianc\u00e9 also lives in. \n\nThe contractor work made it impossible for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, leading to her moving out. That's a significant impact. Even if the bonus was the author's income, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that such a large expenditure without discussion is irresponsible, especially if they have shared financial goals like a wedding. \n\nSo, while the author might not be legally wrong, the social expectation in a committed relationship is that major financial decisions should be discussed. The fact that the project caused such a rift suggests that communication was lacking. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the shared implications of the project. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't include their partner in the decision-making process, leading to a major conflict. However, it's a bit nuanced because the bonus wasn't part of their regular income, and the author did own the house. But relationships require compromise, and this decision seems to have disregarded the partner's concerns. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly with their fianc\u00e9 on a significant financial and structural decision that affects both of them.\n"
