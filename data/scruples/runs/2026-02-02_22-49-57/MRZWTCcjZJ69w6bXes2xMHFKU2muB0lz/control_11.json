Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for several years. They decided to use this money for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is owned outright by the author, as it was given by their grandmother. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the bonus should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding, and the construction is making living in the house impossible.\n\nSo, the main points here are financial responsibility and relationship communication. The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" that might not come again and wants to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible, especially since they are planning to get married. \n\nOwnership of the house is with the author, so legally they can make changes. But since they are engaged, maybe there's an expectation of shared financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before spending the bonus, which is a big deal. Even though the money is the author's, using it for a personal project without considering their partner's concerns can strain the relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this, which is a major consequence. The author's defense is that it's their house, but if the project is making the house uninhabitable, that affects their partner. The contractor work causing living issues might be a valid point from the fianc\u00e9's side. \n\nAlso, financial decisions in a relationship usually require discussion, even if it's one person's money. The bonus was a windfall, but using it for a luxury project without considering the partner's priorities could be seen as selfish. The author didn't take the fianc\u00e9's perspective into account, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. \n\nSo, even though legally the author has the right to spend their money and modify the house, in the context of a committed relationship, not discussing major financial decisions can be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision and for causing significant stress in their relationship.\n"
