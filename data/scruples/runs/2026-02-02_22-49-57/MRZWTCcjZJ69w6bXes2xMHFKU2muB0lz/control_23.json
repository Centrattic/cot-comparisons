Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible when they could have used the money for debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the financial decision and the impact on the relationship. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they can make changes. But this is a shared living space with a fianc\u00e9, so maybe there's an expectation of communication and mutual agreement on major expenses. Using a bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective might be seen as selfish, especially since they're planning to get married. Marriages require financial teamwork, and big decisions like this should ideally be discussed together. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset she's moved out and considering ending the engagement shows how serious the issue is. Even if the author has the legal right, the social and relational aspects might mean they're in the wrong. The bonus is a windfall, but using it for a luxury project when there are other pressing needs (like the wedding or debt) could be seen as irresponsible. The author's stance that it's their house might overlook the fact that they're in a committed relationship where such decisions affect both people. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's concerns and the shared future responsibilities.\n"
