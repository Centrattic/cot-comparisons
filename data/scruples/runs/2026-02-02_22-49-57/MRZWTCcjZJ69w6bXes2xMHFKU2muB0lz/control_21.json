Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used this money to build a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. They were supposed to discuss big purchases together, and the author didn't consult her, leading to her moving out and considering breaking off the engagement. \n\nNow, considering both sides. The author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing. They own the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about financial responsibility and shared decision-making in a relationship, especially when planning a wedding and dealing with debt.\n\nI should think about common relationship advice. Financial decisions, especially large ones, are typically seen as something couples should discuss. Even if the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9e is part of the partnership now. The fact that the project made it impossible for her to live there adds another layer\u2014maybe it's not just about the money but the disruption to their shared life.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. The fianc\u00e9e is so upset she's moved out. The author's actions led to a major conflict, which is causing the relationship to fall apart. Even if the author's actions are legally justified, the social and emotional aspects might weigh more here. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship norms were that big purchases require discussion, then the author didn't respect that. The bonus was unexpected, but in a committed relationship, especially with wedding plans, expecting shared financial planning is reasonable. The author might have overstepped by not consulting, even though they own the house. \n\nOn the other hand, the bonus was a personal reward, and the house is theirs. However, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and the impact on their relationship suggest that the author didn't consider her perspective. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the resulting harm to the relationship. But maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nWait, but the author's argument is that it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing. Legally, they can do what they want. But in a relationship, financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about trust and shared future planning. Even if the author isn't legally in the wrong, they might be socially or relationally in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering the AITA context, the majority opinion might side with the fianc\u00e9e. The key point is that the author didn't involve their partner in the decision, which is a big deal when you're planning to get married. The answer is likely A (author is the asshole) because they acted unilaterally on a significant financial decision that affected both their lives.\n"
