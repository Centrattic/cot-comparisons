Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author using their bonus to build a secret room, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author got a job after being out of work for years, received a five-figure bonus, and decided to use it for a secret room. They own the house outright because it was their grandma's and paid off. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the bonus should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. They argue that the author didn't discuss this project, leading to her moving in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the main points here are about financial responsibility, communication, and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author's argument is that the bonus was \"found money\" and their house, so they had the right to spend it as they wanted. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major renovations without discussion are a deal-breaker.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, the author owns the house and the bonus is their money, so they have the right to use it. But in a relationship, especially when marriage is involved, financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The fact that this project has made the fianc\u00e9 unable to live in the house adds another layer of conflict. The scale of the renovation (tearing down walls, digging up the foundation) is significant and might have implications beyond just the money, like structural integrity or future resale value.\n\nThe key here is communication. Even if the author has the right to spend the bonus, not discussing such a major project with their fianc\u00e9 is a relationship issue. They've been together two years and engaged, so financial discussions are expected to be part of planning for the future. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and savings are valid considerations in a partnership. The author's dismissal of these concerns as \"wildly irresponsible\" might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of their partner's priorities.\n\nAnother angle is the practicality. A secret room with a circular staircase is a cool idea, but the cost and disruption might be excessive. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is prioritizing a personal whim over shared financial goals. Even if the bonus was unexpected, in a committed relationship, big expenditures should be discussed to avoid such conflicts.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the relational aspect is where the issue lies. The failure to communicate and consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective is where the wrongdoing occurs. Relationships require compromise, and major financial decisions affecting shared living spaces should be mutual. The result is a breakdown in communication leading to serious consequences, which makes the author at fault from a relational standpoint.\n"
