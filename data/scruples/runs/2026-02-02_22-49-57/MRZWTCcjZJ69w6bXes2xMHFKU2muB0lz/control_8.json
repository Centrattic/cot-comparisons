Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The author is dealing with a conflict with their fianc\u00e9 over using a bonus to create a secret room in their house.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after a long period of unemployment. They used it for a personal project, which is understandable. They own the house outright, so legally, they can make modifications. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying debt or the wedding. They also mention that the construction is making it hard to live in the house.\n\nThe key points here are communication and financial planning. The author might have assumed the bonus was their own to spend as they liked, but since they're engaged and planning to get married, major financial decisions should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 feels left out of the decision-making process, which is a valid concern in a relationship. Even though the author owns the house, making significant changes without consulting their partner can cause resentment. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows how serious she feels about this. \n\nThe author's argument that it's \"found money\" might not consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective on financial responsibility. Relationships require compromise, and using a large sum for a personal project without discussing it with a partner can be seen as selfish. Even though legally the author has the right to modify their property, relationally, it's important to consider the other person's feelings and future plans.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their plans with their fianc\u00e9, leading to significant conflict and distress. Financial decisions in a committed relationship should involve mutual agreement, especially when it affects shared living space and future plans.\n"
