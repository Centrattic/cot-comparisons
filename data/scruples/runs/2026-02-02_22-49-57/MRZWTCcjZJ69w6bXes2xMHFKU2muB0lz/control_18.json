Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which their fianc\u00e9 is upset about. The key points here are ownership of the house and the financial decision-making. The house was given to the author by their grandma, so they own it outright. That means they have the legal right to make changes. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt or the wedding.\n\nThe author argues the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision since they're getting married. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 has moved out and the relationship might end shows how serious the conflict is.\n\nNow, considering the question: is the author in the wrong? Legally, they have the right to use their bonus as they see fit and modify their own property. Financially, it's about priorities. The author might not be wrong in using their own money, but the lack of communication is a problem. Even though it's their house, a major renovation without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 could be seen as dismissive of their shared future. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, especially if they're planning to merge finances.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether using personal funds for a personal project without consulting a fianc\u00e9 is wrong, especially when it affects the shared home. The AITA subreddit often considers intentions and communication. The author didn't consult, which caused the issue. While legally they're not at fault, socially and relationally, it's a misstep. Therefore, the answer is A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't consider their fianc\u00e9's perspective and the shared implications of the decision.\n"
