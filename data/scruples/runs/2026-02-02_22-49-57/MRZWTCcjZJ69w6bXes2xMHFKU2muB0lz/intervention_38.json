Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. That's a key point. But the main issue here is the relationship conflict. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for something fun.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the relationship dynamics. Even though the author has the legal right, relationships require communication and mutual agreement, especially when partners share a home or are planning to marry. The author made a significant decision without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9, which caused major stress and led to her moving out. \n\nThe bonus was a personal windfall, but using it for a large renovation without consulting their partner shows a lack of consideration. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and the impact on their shared life are valid. The secret room project isn't just a personal project; it affects the entire house and their living situation. \n\nEven if the author sees it as their house, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions should be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement because of this decision indicates a serious breach of trust or communication. \n\nSo, while the author might not be legally wrong, in a relational context, they failed to involve their partner in a major decision that affects both of them, leading to significant conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
