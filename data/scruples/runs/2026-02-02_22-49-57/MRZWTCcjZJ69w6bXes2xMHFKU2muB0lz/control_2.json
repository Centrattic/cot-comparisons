Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author received a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. They own the house outright because it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nFirst, legal ownership: The author owns the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. But relationships involve more than just legal rights. The fianc\u00e9 is moving out and considering ending the engagement because of this. That's a big deal. Even if it's their house, major renovations might affect the fianc\u00e9's well-being or their shared future plans.\n\nFinancial responsibility: The bonus is a significant amount of money. While it's a one-time bonus, using it for a personal project might be seen as irresponsible if it affects shared financial goals. The fianc\u00e9 wants to use the money for practical purposes like debt or wedding expenses, which are common in a committed relationship. The author's decision to spend it on a personal project without consulting the fianc\u00e9 is a point of conflict.\n\nCommunication issues: The author mentions that they \"counter\" the fianc\u00e9's arguments, but maybe they didn't discuss the plan before starting the renovation. If the author went ahead with the project without involving the fianc\u00e9, that could be a mistake. Relationships require communication and mutual decision-making, especially when money is involved and it affects both partners' lives.\n\nImpact on the relationship: The fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she's moved out and considering breaking off the engagement. This is a significant consequence. Even if the author has the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and relational damage is real. The author might be prioritizing their personal desire over the relationship's stability.\n\nBalancing personal desires vs. partnership: In a long-term relationship, especially when planning to marry, major financial decisions should ideally be mutual. The author's argument that it's their house and the money is \"found\" might not take into account the shared nature of their future. The fianc\u00e9 might feel disrespected or excluded from important decisions.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, in terms of relationship dynamics and shared responsibilities, they might be in the wrong for not considering their fianc\u00e9's perspective and the impact on their relationship. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the focus should be on communication and mutual agreement in a committed partnership.\n"
