Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus from a new job. They used it for a personal project, which they wanted for a long time. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal right to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thought the money should be used for shared goals like paying debts, wedding costs, or saving. She feels it's irresponsible and now can't live in the house because of the construction. The argument escalated to her moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for fun. The fianc\u00e9 expects joint decision-making since they're planning to marry. The author's actions caused significant disruption to their living situation and the relationship.\n\nOwnership of the house is on the author's side, so legally they can make changes. But financially, even though the bonus is personal income, in a committed engagement, major financial decisions might require discussion. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, leading to her feeling disrespected. The project's impact on their shared life (construction making the house uninhabitable) adds to the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The answer hinges on the relationship dynamics. While legally they had the right, emotionally and relationally, not discussing such a significant expense that affects their shared home and future plans could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because shared financial planning is important in a long-term commitment. The author might have acted impulsively without considering the partner's expectations, leading to the fallout. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the decision impacted the relationship and shared future, requiring mutual agreement.\n"
