Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a moderator who used a throwaway to ask if they're the asshole for using their bonus to build a secret room in their house, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They own the house outright because it was given to them by their grandma. They hired a contractor to make structural changes. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and wants the money used for debt, wedding costs, or savings. She's now moved out, possibly ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: ownership of the house, the bonus being \"found money,\" and the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about financial responsibility. The author's actions are legally their right since they own the house. However, the conflict arises from the financial decision and the impact on the relationship. The bonus was unexpected, but using it for a personal project without discussing with a partner who's planning a wedding might be seen as selfish. Even though it's their house, a significant renovation like tearing walls and digging into the foundation could affect the home's structure and value, which might be a shared concern in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme, but the author didn't consult her before making the decision. In relationships, especially when planning a major life step like marriage, financial decisions should be mutual. The author's insistence on going through with it despite the fianc\u00e9e's objections could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the partnership. So while legally and technically they have the right, emotionally and relationally, it's a problem. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
