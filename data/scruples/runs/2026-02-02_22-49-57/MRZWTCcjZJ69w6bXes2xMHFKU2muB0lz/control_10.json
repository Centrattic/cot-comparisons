Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author got a job after being out of steady work for several years. They received a five-figure bonus last year. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright because it was given to them by their grandma. They hired a contractor to start tearing down walls and digging into the foundation for a basement with a circular staircase. The fianc\u00e9e is furious, thinking it's irresponsible to use the bonus this way. She mentions they could have used the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, and since it's their house, they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9e is so upset she moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. The author owns the house outright. So legally, they have the right to modify it as they see fit. However, the fianc\u00e9e isn't mentioned as a co-owner, so maybe that's a factor. But since they're engaged, perhaps there's an expectation of shared decision-making.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The bonus is described as \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9e argues it could have been used for more practical purposes. The author might have a point if the bonus is a one-time thing, but the fianc\u00e9e is concerned about financial responsibility. Using a large sum for a personal project when there are other financial obligations (like a wedding, debt) could be seen as irresponsible, especially if they're planning to get married. The wedding's cost might be a shared responsibility, and not contributing could put pressure on her family, which is a valid point.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is causing a major rift. The fianc\u00e9e has moved out and is considering ending the engagement. The author might not have considered how this project affects their partner's feelings and the relationship. Even if legal rights exist, relationships often require compromise and communication. The author didn't discuss this project with the fianc\u00e9e before proceeding, which is a problem. The fact that the work is already underway makes it impossible to reverse, which adds to the fianc\u00e9e's frustration.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, the key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's perspective. The fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected or excluded from major financial decisions, especially regarding shared future plans like the wedding. Marital expectations often involve joint financial planning, even if legally the house is the author's. The author's decision to go ahead without consulting the fianc\u00e9e shows a lack of respect for her feelings and their partnership.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9e in the decision-making process, leading to significant conflict. Even if the legal rights are on their side, the relational aspect is more critical here. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
