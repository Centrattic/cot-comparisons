Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while, and got a five-figure bonus. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's irresponsible, and they might break off the engagement. The author thinks the bonus was \"found money\" and wanted to enjoy it, while the fianc\u00e9 feels it's something they should have discussed together since they're planning to get married.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author says it's their house and they have legal authority. But even if it's legal, relationships often require mutual agreement on major decisions, especially when it's a shared home, even if not legally owned together yet. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that using the bonus without discussion is selfish, especially if they have future financial plans like paying off debt or the wedding. The construction is also making the house uninhabitable, which adds practical issues. \n\nSo even though the author has legal rights, in a relationship close to marriage, big financial decisions usually need to be made together. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset and it's leading to breaking up the engagement suggests that the author didn't consider their partner's perspective. The author's argument about \"found money\" might not resonate if the fianc\u00e9 sees it as part of their shared future. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because using the bonus for such a project without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9, especially when it affects their plans and living situation, is a failure to communicate and consider their partner's needs. The answer might be A.\n"
