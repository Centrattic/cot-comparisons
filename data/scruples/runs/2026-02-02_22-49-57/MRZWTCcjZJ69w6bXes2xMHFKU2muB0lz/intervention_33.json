Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took a bonus they received from work and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and considering ending the engagement because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that the bonus was unexpected and that they wanted to use it for a fun project. They own the house outright, so they have the legal right to make renovations. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that using the bonus was irresponsible, especially since they could have used the money for more practical things like paying off debt or helping with the wedding. She's also upset about the construction making the house uninhabitable and has moved out, which is a big deal.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points. The author's actions were based on their personal desire, but there's a relationship involved here. Even though the house is their own, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the relationship and major financial decisions should probably be discussed. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 before making such a large expenditure and structural changes. That lack of communication could be a problem. \n\nThe bonus is considered \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns about financial planning. Using the bonus for a luxury project when there are other financial obligations might be seen as selfish. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is moving out and the engagement is in jeopardy suggests that this issue is causing significant strain. \n\nEven though the author has the legal right to renovate their own home, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might have neglected their partner's feelings and the partnership aspect. The decision to proceed without discussing it with the fianc\u00e9 shows a lack of consideration for her perspective, which is a key factor in relationship dynamics. \n\nSo, while the author's desire to create a secret room isn't inherently wrong, the way they went about it without considering their partner's concerns and the impact on their relationship likely is. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in this situation.\n"
