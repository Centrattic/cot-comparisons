Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a bonus after being unemployed for years. They used it for a project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is owned outright, so they claim legal authority. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for debts, the wedding, or savings. The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" that might not recur. The relationship is now in trouble, with the fianc\u00e9 moving out.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has the right to their bonus, which is their income. They own the house, so they can modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without collaboration. Even though it's their house, major renovations usually affect both partners, especially if they live there. The financial decision to spend a large bonus might have implications for shared goals like the wedding and debts, which the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about. The argument is intense enough that the engagement is in jeopardy.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, they had the financial means and legal right. On the other, the decision didn't consider the partner's perspective, leading to significant strain. Relationship issues aren't just about right or wrong but also about communication and mutual respect. The author didn't see the need to discuss it, which the fianc\u00e9 clearly felt was necessary. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both financial responsibility and the impact on the relationship. While the author had the right to spend the bonus, not discussing such a major project with their fianc\u00e9 might be seen as dismissive. The fact that it caused such a rift suggests that there was a failure in considering the partner's feelings and shared goals. So, even if legally and financially they're justified, the social and relational aspect might tip the balance.\n"
