Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which required major construction. The house was given to them by their grandma, paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible\u2014they could have used it for paying debt, the wedding, or saving. The argument got so bad she moved in with her sister, and they might break up.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels that since they're getting married, big financial decisions should be discussed together. She's not happy with the unilateral decision, especially since the construction is affecting the house's livability.\n\nHmm, financial decisions in relationships can be tricky. The author had the legal right to modify the house since they own it. But the key issue here is communication and shared financial planning. Even if the money was technically the author's, using a significant bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective could be a problem. Relationships often involve compromise, and major expenses might require discussion, especially when planning to marry. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about debt, the wedding, and future savings, which are valid concerns. The author's action, while understandable from a personal desire, might have disregarded the fianc\u00e9's priorities, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no\u2014they have the right to their money and the house. But relationship-wise, it's about respecting each other's needs. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 moved out and is considering ending the relationship suggests this was a significant breach of trust or communication. The author might not be the \"asshole\" legally, but in terms of relationship responsibility, they might have made a mistake by not discussing it beforehand. So, maybe answer A (Yes, in the wrong) because even if they had the right, not considering the partner's concerns caused major issues. However, others might say it's their money to spend as they wish. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because of the relational impact.\n"
