Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person received a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. They own the house outright because it was inherited from their grandma. The main conflict is with their fianc\u00e9e who's upset about the financial decision and the construction disrupting their life.\n\nFirst, the author argues that the bonus is \"found money\" and they had the right to use it as they wanted. However, they were in a committed relationship with someone they're planning to marry. Major financial decisions, especially ones that affect shared living spaces, should ideally be discussed together. Even though the house is in the author's name, the fianc\u00e9e is living there too, and tearing down walls and building a new room would significantly impact her life. The construction causing her to move out is a big deal. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's their house and their money. But when you're engaged, especially for two years, financial and lifestyle decisions should involve mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e feels excluded and that her priorities (like paying off debt, wedding costs) were overlooked. The fact that she's considering ending the engagement shows the severity of the situation. \n\nSo, while the author might not have broken any laws, the social and relational expectations in a serious relationship suggest that major decisions should be made together. The key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's concerns. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't discuss the plans with their partner, leading to significant conflict and disruption.\n"
