Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They used the bonus to hire a contractor to build a secret room, which involved tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The house is owned outright by the author, so there's no mortgage issue. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thought the money could have been used for paying debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to use it as they see fit. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding and has moved out.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility and communication within a relationship. The author's actions are legally justified because they own the house. However, the problem is more about the relationship dynamics. Even though the author has the legal right, relationships require mutual consent and discussion, especially when significant decisions are made that affect the other person. The secret room project seems to be a personal desire, but using it without consulting the fianc\u00e9, especially when there are financial priorities she cares about, might be seen as selfish.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they are getting married, so shared financial discussions are necessary. The author might have assumed they could make the decision alone, but in a committed relationship, major expenditures that impact shared living space and financial goals should be discussed. The fact that the project made the house uninhabitable for her adds to the conflict, as it's affecting their daily life together.\n\nThe author's argument that it's \"found money\" could be valid, but the way it was handled\u2014without prior discussion\u2014might be the issue. Even if it's a bonus, in a relationship, partners often have shared financial expectations. The author might have overstepped by not considering the fianc\u00e9's priorities and not communicating their plans, leading to a breakdown in trust and cooperation.\n\nSo, while legally the author isn't in the wrong, in a relationship context, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and priorities is a problem. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the issue stems from not discussing the major financial decision and how it affects their shared life, even if they have the legal right to do it.\n"
