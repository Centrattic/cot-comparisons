Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus that was unexpected and significant. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room. The house is fully paid for and owned by the author, so they have the legal right to make changes. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. She's also struggling with the living situation because of the construction. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing. \n\nNow, considering both sides. Legally, the author isn't wrong because they own the house. Financially, using a bonus for a personal project isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's a one-time windfall. However, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The author didn't discuss this with their fianc\u00e9 beforehand, which is a big issue. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about shared financial responsibilities and practical needs are valid, especially since they're planning to get married. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for her adds to the tension.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally or financially in the wrong, the lack of communication and consideration for their partner's feelings and practical concerns might make them the asshole in the relationship context. The key here is that major financial decisions, especially when involving shared life plans like a wedding, should be discussed with a partner. The author's actions, though not illegal, may have disregarded their fianc\u00e9's priorities and caused unnecessary conflict.\n"
