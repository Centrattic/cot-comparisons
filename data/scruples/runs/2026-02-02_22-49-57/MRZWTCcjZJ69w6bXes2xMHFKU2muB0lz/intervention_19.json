Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from a job. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is owned outright by the author, so legally they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible. They were supposed to discuss finances together, and the author went ahead without consulting her, leading to her moving out and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. Legally, the author has the right to use their money as they see fit. But relationships often require communication and shared decisions. The author might have thought the bonus was a one-time opportunity, hence the \"found money\" argument. However, major financial decisions, especially ones that affect the home they presumably plan to share, should be discussed with a partner. The fact that the author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 and went ahead with construction that's making the house uninhabitable for her is a problem. Even though it's their house, the relationship's future is at stake here. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and financial planning are valid. The author might not be the \"asshole\" in the legal sense, but in terms of relationship responsibilities, they might have been in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and not discussing the project beforehand. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's financial concerns and the impact on their shared life.\n"
