Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about using a bonus to build a secret room, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from a job after being unemployed for a while. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for other purposes like debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's their house and the bonus is \"found money\" that might not come again.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, the author owns the house, so they have the right to make changes. Financially, though, the bonus could be seen as shared since they're engaged and planning to marry. The fianc\u00e9 feels it was irresponsible and that major renovations without discussion caused a rift. The key points are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Even if the author has the right to use the money, not discussing big financial decisions, especially ones that affect the entire house and their future together, might be the issue. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 moved out and the relationship is in jeopardy suggests the action had significant consequences. So, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for using the bonus, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns might make them the asshole. But maybe there's a balance here. The author's right to their bonus vs. the fianc\u00e9's expectations. Hmm. It's tricky. Maybe the answer is B, but with consideration that the author should have discussed it. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If they didn't discuss it, then maybe they are. So A or B? The user thinks the author is not wrong, but I'm leaning towards B but with a nuance. Wait, the answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Deciding between those. Since the author is using their own bonus, which they earned, and they own the house, but the relationship context matters. In relationships, big financial decisions usually require discussion. However, the argument is about whether it's their money to spend as they wish. The fianc\u00e9's anger is about the use of the money and the impact on their shared future. The author might be in the wrong for not discussing it, but also the fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme. It's a tough call. Maybe B, as the author isn't necessarily wrong, but should have communicated better. However, the act of using the bonus for personal use without discussion could be seen as the issue. So maybe A? Or B? The answer depends on societal expectations of shared finances in an engagement. Typically, pre-marriage, financial decisions should be mutual. So maybe A. But since the bonus is personal income, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
