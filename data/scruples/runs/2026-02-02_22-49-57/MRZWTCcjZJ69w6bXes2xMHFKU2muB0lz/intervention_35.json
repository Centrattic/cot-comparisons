Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author used a bonus to create a secret room, which caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author received a bonus from their new job, which they describe as \"found money\" that might not happen again. They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss it beforehand, and she feels it's irresponsible. She thinks the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The situation has escalated to the point of considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, I need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and communication. The author owns the house, so they have legal authority to make changes. However, relationships often require shared decision-making, especially regarding finances. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e before spending the bonus, which is a significant issue. Even though the bonus is their income, using it for a major project without discussing it with their partner can be seen as a lack of consideration for their partner's financial priorities and the shared future they're building towards.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is valid because they are planning to get married, which implies that financial decisions should be made jointly. The author's argument that it's their house might be legally correct, but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. The fact that the construction has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9e exacerbates the problem, as it affects their living situation.\n\nSo, while the author has the right to their own property and income, the lack of communication and consideration for their partner's feelings and the relationship's financial planning is where they might be at fault. The decision to spend the bonus without discussion, leading to a major conflict, suggests that the author is not fully respecting their partner's role in shared financial decisions. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
