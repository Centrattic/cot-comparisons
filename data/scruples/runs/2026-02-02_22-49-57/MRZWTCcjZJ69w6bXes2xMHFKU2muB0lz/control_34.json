Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big argument with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They wanted a secret room for fun, hired a contractor, and started modifying the house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's so mad that she moved out and might end the engagement.\n\nThe author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" and they own the house, so it's their choice. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision since they're getting married. \n\nHmm, so the key points here are financial responsibility and shared decision-making in a relationship. Even though the author owns the house, when you're engaged and planning to marry, big financial decisions might need mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input was ignored, which could be a valid point. Using a significant bonus on a personal project without discussing it with a partner, especially when there are other financial obligations (like a wedding), might be seen as selfish. \n\nBut on the other hand, the bonus was unexpected and the author might see it as their own money to use as they wish. However, in a committed relationship, especially nearing marriage, financial planning usually involves both partners. The author didn't consult, leading to a breakdown. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong since it's their house and money, emotionally and relationally, they might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective. The fianc\u00e9's arguments about shared responsibilities and planning for the future are valid. The author's actions caused significant distress and potential break-up, which suggests they might be the asshole here. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
