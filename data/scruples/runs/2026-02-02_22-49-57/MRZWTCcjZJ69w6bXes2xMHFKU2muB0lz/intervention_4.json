Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which they've always wanted. The house is fully paid off and inherited from their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the money should have been used for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house.\n\nSo, legally, the author has the right to do what they want with their own house and money. They didn't spend shared funds since they're not married yet. But relationships involve mutual decisions, especially when planning to get married. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, leading to a major rift. \n\nThe key points are ownership of the house and the financial decision-making in a pre-marital relationship. The author might not be legally wrong, but the social aspect of the relationship is strained because big life decisions weren't discussed. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid as they might expect some level of joint financial planning, even if the house is the author's. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether personal ownership overrides the need for mutual agreement in a committed relationship. While the author isn't in legal trouble, the relational impact is significant. So, the author might not be the asshole in terms of rights, but the situation shows poor communication, which could make them responsible for the fallout.\n"
