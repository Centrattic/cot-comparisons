Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while and received a five-figure bonus. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, and started construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married and should discuss finances. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again and that they own the house outright.\n\nSo, the key points are: legal ownership of the house, the bonus as personal income, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and future planning. The author's actions are within their legal rights, but the conflict arises from the relationship dynamics. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input wasn't considered, which is a common issue in relationships where big decisions are made without mutual discussion. \n\nEven though the author has the right to use their bonus and modify their property, relationships require communication and compromise. By not discussing the project with the fianc\u00e9, the author might have disregarded her feelings and the shared financial goals they might have as a couple. The fianc\u00e9's move to end the engagement is extreme, but her concerns about financial planning and living conditions are valid. The author's stance that it's their house and the bonus is personal might be seen as not considering the partner's perspective. \n\nSo, while legally and in terms of personal finances the author isn't in the wrong, in the context of a relationship where major life decisions are involved, not discussing such a significant project could be considered inconsiderate or dismissive. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the issue is more about relationship communication rather than legal ownership or financial misuse.\n"
