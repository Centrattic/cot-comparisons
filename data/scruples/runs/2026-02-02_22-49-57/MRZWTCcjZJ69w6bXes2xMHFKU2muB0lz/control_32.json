Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They decided to use the money for a personal project, a secret room with a bookshelf door and a new basement. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the author was irresponsible and that the money could have been used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their own house, so they have the right to do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved out, and the relationship might end.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility, shared financial planning in a relationship, and respect for each other's priorities. The author is using their own bonus, which is their own money, but since they are engaged, finances often become a shared topic. The fianc\u00e9 feels that major financial decisions should be discussed, especially when it affects the house they're living in. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the renovation is causing them to live in an uncomfortable environment, which is a practical issue.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing. But in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married, financial decisions that impact both people's lives should be mutual. The fact that the author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 and proceeded with a major renovation could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because financial decisions in a relationship often require compromise and communication. The author might be seen as prioritizing a personal whim over shared responsibilities, which can lead to trust issues.\n\nHowever, the author did use their own bonus money, which they earned, so there's an argument that they have the right to spend it as they wish. But the project affects the entire house, which the fianc\u00e9 might consider a shared asset, especially if they're planning to live there together. The contractor work causing disruptions in the house adds to the fianc\u00e9's stress, making it harder for her to live there. The author's refusal to consider her viewpoint and the impact on the relationship might tip the balance towards them being in the wrong.\n\nIn many relationships, transparency and discussion about major purchases or projects is expected, even if the money is personal. The author's actions could be seen as self-centered, not considering the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about financial planning for their future together. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement due to this issue shows the severity of the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and for not respecting the fianc\u00e9's financial priorities in the context of their relationship.\n"
