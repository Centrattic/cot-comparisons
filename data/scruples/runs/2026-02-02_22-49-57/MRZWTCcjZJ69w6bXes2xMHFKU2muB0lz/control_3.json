Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus from a new job, which they consider \"found money.\" They own the house outright because it was given to them by their grandma, so there's no mortgage. They hired a contractor to build the secret room in the spare bedroom, which involves tearing walls and digging a basement. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. They were supposed to discuss it since they're getting married. She mentions using the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author's response is that the bonus might not happen again, so they wanted to use it for something fun. The fianc\u00e9 has moved in with her sister and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author owns the house, so they have the right to modify it. The bonus was their own money; they weren't obligated to use it for shared expenses. However, the project is causing significant disruption to the house and their fianc\u00e9's ability to live there. Also, the fianc\u00e9 felt it was a decision they should have made together, which is a valid point in a relationship. Even though the author has legal rights over the house, relationships involve mutual decisions, especially when major life events like marriage are involved. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, leading to a major conflict. The argument is about responsibility and shared financial planning. While the author isn't legally wrong, in a relationship, communication and mutual agreement are important. The fact that the project is making the fianc\u00e9 feel unable to live in the house adds to the disruption. So the author may be at fault for not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective and not discussing the use of the bonus money and the project's impact on their living situation. The answer might be A (the author is the asshole) because they didn't communicate and their actions caused significant problems in the relationship despite owning the house. But some might argue B (not the asshole) since it's their money and property. But in a committed relationship, especially pre-marriage, financial decisions affecting the shared home should be discussed. So leaning towards A.\n"
