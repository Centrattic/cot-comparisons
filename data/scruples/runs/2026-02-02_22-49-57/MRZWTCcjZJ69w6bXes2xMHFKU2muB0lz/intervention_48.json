Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The main points are:\n\n- The author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job.\n- They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright.\n- They hired a contractor to start the project, tearing down walls and modifying the foundation.\n- The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and has caused them to move out, possibly ending the relationship.\n- The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, while the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a financial misstep and disrupts their living situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they used their own bonus money, which they earned. They own the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. But relationships involve shared responsibilities and discussions. The key here is whether they discussed the project beforehand. The author mentions it was supposed to be a fun project but didn't check with the fianc\u00e9e, leading to major issues. Even though it's their money and house, major projects that affect shared living space should be discussed with a partner, especially when planning a wedding. The fact that the project made the fianc\u00e9e unable to live there and caused a breakup suggests that the author didn't consider their partner's perspective and financial priorities. So, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for using their own money, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and practical concerns might make them the asshole. So, answer A.\n"
