Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which the fianc\u00e9e strongly opposes.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus, which they consider \"found money\" because they hadn't expected it. They used it to build a secret room, hiring a contractor. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal authority. However, the fianc\u00e9e is upset because they were planning to get married, and she believes the money should have been used for more responsible purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding. The situation escalated to the point where she's moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author is in the wrong. Key points to consider:\n\n1. **Financial Responsibility**: The author used a bonus for a personal project. While it's their money, the fianc\u00e9e argues that they should have discussed major expenditures, especially since they're planning to get married. Even though the bonus is \"found money,\" in a committed relationship, significant financial decisions might require mutual agreement.\n\n2. **Communication**: The author may have assumed they could use the bonus as they wished without consulting the fianc\u00e9e. However, in a relationship, especially nearing marriage, discussing such a large expense is important. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e feels unheard and that the project made the house uninhabitable suggests a breakdown in communication.\n\n3. **Impact on the Relationship**: The project has caused major conflict, leading to the fianc\u00e9e moving out and considering ending the engagement. The author's insistence that \"it's my house\" might be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9e's concerns, especially since they were planning to marry and share the home.\n\n4. **Legal vs. Emotional Ownership**: Legally, the author owns the house and can make changes. However, emotionally and in terms of partnership, the fianc\u00e9e likely felt that major renovations should have been a joint decision. The secret room project may have ignored her feelings about shared responsibilities and future plans.\n\n5. **Responsibility to the Relationship**: Even if the author has the legal right to renovate, the decision to proceed without discussion, especially when it affects the fianc\u00e9e's ability to live in the home, could be seen as selfish. Marriage involves shared financial planning, and the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about using the bonus for debt or the wedding might be valid.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of the fianc\u00e9e's perspective and the nature of their relationship. While they have the right to use their money as they see fit, the lack of communication and the resulting harm to the relationship could mean they are in the wrong. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a stronger argument for B. However, given the relationship context, the impact, and the failure to discuss, the answer leans towards A.\n"
