Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 spending a bonus on a secret room, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus from a new job. They wanted to create a secret room, which they've always found fun. They hired a contractor, started construction, and now the fianc\u00e9 is upset. The key points here are the ownership of the house and the use of personal funds.\n\nThe house was given to the author by their grandma, paid off, and owned outright. So legally, the author has the right to make changes. The bonus is their personal money, not shared yet, so using it for personal projects isn't inherently wrong. However, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The author didn't discuss this project with their fianc\u00e9, which caused significant stress and even led to the fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nWhile the author had the legal right to use their bonus and modify the house, the emotional impact on the partner is significant. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without consideration for their shared future, like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as irresponsible. \n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication and planning together. Even though the author had the right to spend the money, a major renovation affecting their shared living space without discussing it with their partner is a breach in mutual decision-making. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because shared financial decisions, especially involving a home and upcoming marriage, are crucial in a relationship. The author's actions might be seen as selfish in the context of the partnership, even if legally they were within their rights.\n"
