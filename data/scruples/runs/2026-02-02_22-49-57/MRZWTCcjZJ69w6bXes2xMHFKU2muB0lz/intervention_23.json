Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in the house, which led to a major conflict with the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus at a job after being out of work for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involves significant construction work. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible to use the bonus for this project instead of paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She also can't live in the house while the construction is happening, leading her to move in with her sister and possibly end the relationship.\n\nThe author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" (as in unexpected or a one-time thing) and that they own the house outright. They argue that it's their house and they have the right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, feels that big financial decisions should be discussed, especially since they are planning to get married and this affects their shared future.\n\nSo, where's the issue here? The key points are financial responsibility, communication, and shared decisions in a relationship. The author made a significant investment using their bonus, which the fianc\u00e9e wasn't on board with. Even though the author owns the house, the decision to undertake such a large project that disrupts their living situation might require mutual agreement, especially when it's a shared home and they're planning to get married.\n\nIn relationships, especially before marriage, major financial decisions and home modifications can be touchy. The author might have assumed they had autonomy over their own money and property, but the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that they should be planning together. The fact that the construction made the house uninhabitable for her is another point\u2014this could be seen as neglecting her needs and the practicalities of their life together.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by not discussing the project with the fianc\u00e9e. Even if the bonus was unexpected, using it for a large personal project without considering the partner's viewpoint might be seen as a lack of communication and consideration. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and future planning are valid, especially if they have mutual financial goals.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the bonus was their personal gain and they have the right to use it as they see fit. But in a committed relationship, especially when living together and planning to marry, there's an expectation of shared decision-making. The fact that the project caused such a massive conflict suggests that the author didn't take the fianc\u00e9e's input, leading to significant stress and possible relationship breakdown.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they unilaterally made a major financial and life-altering decision without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9e, leading to consequences that affect both of them. The fianc\u00e9e's anger is justified because the decision impacts their shared future and financial plans.\n"
