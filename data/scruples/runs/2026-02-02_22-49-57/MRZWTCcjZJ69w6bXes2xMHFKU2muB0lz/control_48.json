Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author received a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. They own the house outright, so they have legal authority to make changes. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't discuss the use of the bonus money, which she thought could be used for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and they should enjoy it, and that it's their house.\n\nFirst, legal ownership is a factor. The author owns the house, so they can make structural changes. But the fianc\u00e9 is part of the relationship, and maybe there's an expectation of shared financial decisions. Even though the bonus is the author's income, when you're engaged, especially for two years, financial planning might be a shared responsibility. The author didn't discuss the use of the bonus with the fianc\u00e9, leading to a major conflict. The fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding, which is a serious consequence.\n\nThe key points here are communication and shared responsibilities in a committed relationship. While the author has legal rights to the house and the bonus, relationships often require mutual decision-making, especially when big changes affect both partners. The author might argue that it's their money and their house, but the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they should have discussed it. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now moving out and considering ending the engagement suggests that the author's actions caused significant harm to the relationship. Even if legally correct, the social and relational aspect might mean the author is in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings and expectations.\n"
