Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time windfall and they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9e is so upset she moved out and might call off the wedding.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author owns the house, so legally they can do what they want with it. But since they're engaged, there's a relationship aspect. Even though it's their money, big financial decisions that affect the relationship might require discussion.\n\nThe author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e before making the project. That seems like a problem. Even if the money is theirs, using a significant bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective can cause conflict. The fianc\u00e9e feels disrespected and the project is making it hard to live in the house during construction. \n\nSo while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in the legal sense, in terms of relationship dynamics, they might have been negligent in not discussing the decision. The answer might depend on whether the author acknowledged the fianc\u00e9e's concerns and tried to find a compromise. Since the author didn't consider her feelings and it led to a major rift, they might be at fault in the relationship context. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and considering the fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme, maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. But given the lack of communication, maybe they are partly in the wrong. I'm a bit torn here. The answer could be A (yes) because they didn't communicate, or B (no) because it's their money. But in relationships, communication is key. So maybe A.\n"
