Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus from their job, which they consider \"found money.\" They decided to use it for a personal project, which they've always wanted. They own the house outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The construction has also made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading her to move out and consider breaking off the wedding.\n\nThe key points here are ownership of the house and the use of personal funds versus shared financial planning. The author owns the house and the bonus is their personal income, so legally they can use it as they like. However, in a relationship, big decisions might require mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without her input, leading to conflict. \n\nThe author argues it's their house and the bonus is their money. The fianc\u00e9 feels neglected and that her priorities are being ignored. The question is whether using personal funds for a personal project without discussing it with a partner is inconsiderate. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the legal right and the bonus is their money. However, relationship-wise, not discussing such a significant project with a fianc\u00e9 could be seen as a mistake. But in terms of right or wrong, the answer might be B (No). The author isn't legally or morally obligated to consult, but the relationship issue is more about communication. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and they had the authority, the answer is B.\n"
