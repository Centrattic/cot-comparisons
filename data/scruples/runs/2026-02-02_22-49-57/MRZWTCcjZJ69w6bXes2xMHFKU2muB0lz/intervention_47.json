Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author got a bonus from a new job and used it to create a secret room in their house. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset and considering breaking off the wedding. \n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright since it was given to them by their grandma. They have legal authority to make changes. The bonus was a one-time thing, which they see as \"found money.\" They argue that it's their choice to spend it on something fun like the secret room.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't consult her about using the bonus. She thinks the money could have been used for more practical things like paying off debt or the wedding. The construction is also making the house uninhabitable for her, leading her to move out. The main issues here are communication, financial planning, and the impact on their living situation.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's their house and the bonus was a one-time event. But relationships require communication and mutual agreement, especially regarding finances. Even though the author has legal ownership, major home renovations that affect both partners should ideally be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement suggests that the author might have ignored her feelings and priorities.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's perspective might make them the asshole in the relationship context. The answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the failure to communicate and consider the partner's concerns, despite the legal ownership.\n"
