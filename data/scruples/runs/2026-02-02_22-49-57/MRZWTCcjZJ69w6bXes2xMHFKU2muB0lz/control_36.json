Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright, inherited from their grandma. So legally, they have the right to make changes. The bonus was a one-time, unexpected windfall. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for a fun project. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they had other priorities like paying off debt, wedding expenses, and saving. She's so upset she moved out and is considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making the project. Even though the house is theirs, a major renovation like tearing down walls and digging into the foundation would significantly affect the living conditions of the house, especially for someone living there. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that such a big decision should have been mutual, especially since they're planning to get married and presumably share financial responsibilities.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bonus was a bonus and they wanted to use it for something personal. However, in a committed relationship, especially when planning marriage, major financial decisions usually require discussion. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows how serious she takes this. The project isn't just a small expense; it's altering the structure of the house, which can have long-term implications. The author might not be considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective that this money could have been used for shared goals like the wedding or debt, leading to financial strain.\n\nWhile the author has the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and relational aspects are crucial. Not discussing the project with the fianc\u00e9 could be seen as dismissive of her concerns and priorities. The fact that the project is making the house uninhabitable adds to the fianc\u00e9's stress, which is a significant issue.\n\nSo, even though using the bonus might not be legally wrong, in a relationship context, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's needs and feelings could make the author the asshole here. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consult their partner on a major financial and structural decision that affects both of them, especially when planning to marry.\n"
