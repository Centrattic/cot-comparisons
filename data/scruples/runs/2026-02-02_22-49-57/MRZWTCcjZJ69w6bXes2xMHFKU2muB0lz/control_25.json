Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took their bonus to create a secret room is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and shared expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for several years. They used this money for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss this, considering shared financial responsibilities like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The author feels the bonus is \"found money\" and their right to spend it as they wish since they own the house.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, financially, bonuses are part of one's income, especially if it's a one-time windfall. Legally, the author owns the house and can modify it. However, relationships require communication and mutual consideration. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, who's planning a wedding and might be under financial stress. The project is causing significant disruption to the house, making it hard for her to live there, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is valid because they're getting married, implying shared financial planning. The author's decision, while legally and financially their right, might overlook the emotional and practical impact on the relationship. The secret room project's scale (digging foundations, tearing walls) isn't something minor; it's a major renovation affecting the house they might share.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is also understandable. They used their own money for a personal dream. The issue here is the lack of communication. Even if the author had the right to spend the bonus, discussing it with their fianc\u00e9e could have prevented the conflict. The fianc\u00e9e might feel excluded from important financial decisions, which is a common source of relationship stress.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspect is where the problem lies. The answer hinges on whether the failure to communicate and consider the fianc\u00e9e's concerns makes the author at fault. In relationship contexts, shared decisions, especially those impacting both partners' lives, are crucial. The author's actions, though not illegal, show a lack of consideration for the partner's feelings and the shared future they're building. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9e in the decision, leading to significant conflict.\n"
