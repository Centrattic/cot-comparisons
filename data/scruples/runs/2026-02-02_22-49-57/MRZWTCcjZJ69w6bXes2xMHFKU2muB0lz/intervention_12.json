Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author took a bonus from their job and used it to build a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the money should have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or saving for the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author worked for the bonus, it's their own money, and they own the house outright. Legally, they have the right to use the money as they see fit. But the fianc\u00e9 feels like they should have discussed it together, which is a valid point in relationships where shared financial decisions are important.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bonus was unexpected and might not happen again, so they wanted to spend it on a fun project. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that since they're getting married, big financial decisions should be mutual. The conflict here is between individual freedom and partnership responsibilities.\n\nThe author did mention that they hired a contractor and made structural changes, which might affect the house they both live in. The fianc\u00e9 is now unable to live there because of the construction, which adds another layer of stress. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" might not fully consider the shared living situation and the emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9.\n\nWhile the author has the right to their money, relationships often require compromise and communication. The fact that the author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a significant decision could be seen as selfish, even if legally they're not wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, though intense, is about feeling disrespected and not being part of the decision-making process.\n\nSo, even though the author isn't legally in the wrong, the ethical aspect here is about partnership and mutual respect. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the decision affected both people in the relationship and wasn't discussed beforehand, leading to a major conflict. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because it's their own money and house. However, the relationship impact is significant, so A could be the more balanced answer.\n"
