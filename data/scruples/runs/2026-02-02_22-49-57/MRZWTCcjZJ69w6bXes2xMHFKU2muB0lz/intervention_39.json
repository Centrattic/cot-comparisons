Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from their new job. They decided to use that money to create a secret room in their house, which involves significant construction work. The house was given to them by their grandma, paid off, and they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. She wanted the money to go towards paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. The construction has made the house hard for her to live in, and they're now facing a possible breakup.\n\nSo the main points are: ownership of the house and the bonus money, the fianc\u00e9e's expectations, and the impact of the project on their relationship. \n\nThe author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing, so they wanted to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9e feels that since they're getting married, such decisions should be discussed together. The construction is causing immediate living issues. \n\nOwnership-wise, the author is in the right because they own the house and the bonus is their money. However, in a committed relationship, especially one planning marriage, financial decisions that affect shared living spaces and future plans (like a wedding) might require mutual agreement. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a problem. Even though the money is theirs, the project affects both of them, especially since they live together. The fianc\u00e9e's move to her sister's house suggests that the author's project is significantly disrupting their shared life. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about using \"found money\" might be valid, but the lack of communication and the fianc\u00e9e's valid concerns about future financial obligations (debt, wedding) could tip the balance. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's perspective and the shared implications. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for spending their own money, the failure to communicate and consider the fianc\u00e9e's concerns might make them the asshole here. The answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of discussion and the impact on the relationship, despite owning the house and the money.\n"
