Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used it to build a secret room with a contractor, tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and they should have used the money for other priorities like paying off debt, the wedding, or savings. She's even moved in with her sister and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nThe author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, and since it's their house, they have the right to do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision, especially since they're planning to get married.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they do own the house outright, so they have legal rights to modify it. The bonus was a one-time thing, so from a financial perspective, using it for a personal project isn't inherently wrong. However, relationships involve shared decisions, especially when it comes to major financial commitments. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, and the project is causing significant stress and disrupting their living situation. Even though the house is in their name, a major renovation affecting the entire structure could impact the fianc\u00e9 as well. \n\nMarriage planning usually brings shared financial responsibilities. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and future savings are valid. The author might have seen the bonus as their own, but in a committed relationship nearing marriage, big financial decisions should be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 has moved out because she can't live in the house anymore shows the project is affecting both of them. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally in the wrong, the relational aspect is key here. Not discussing such a significant expense and modification with a fianc\u00e9, especially when it affects their living situation and shared future plans, could be seen as a failure to consider the partner's feelings and financial priorities. Therefore, the author might be the asshole here for not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision, leading to a major rift.\n"
