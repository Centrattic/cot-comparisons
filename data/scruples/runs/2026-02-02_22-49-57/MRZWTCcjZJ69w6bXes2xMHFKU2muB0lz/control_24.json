Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author got a bonus from a new job after being out of steady work for a while. They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, and they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt or the wedding. The project is causing them to move out and consider breaking off the engagement.\n\nHmm. The author owns the house, so legally they can do what they want. But they're in a relationship, so this is about shared responsibilities and communication. The bonus was a one-time thing, and the author sees it as \"found money.\" The fianc\u00e9 feels her needs or the couple's shared goals were ignored. Even though the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the life they're building together, especially since they're engaged. The project has made her life difficult, leading to her moving out. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, they used their own money for a personal project. On the other, the fianc\u00e9 wasn't consulted, and it's causing major strain. Even if the author has the legal right, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. Maybe the author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's feelings or the shared financial planning. Using a large portion of the bonus without discussion could be seen as selfish, especially when the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns about debt and wedding costs. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate properly and the project is affecting both of them, even if it's their house.\n"
