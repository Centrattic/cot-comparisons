Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used their bonus to create a secret room, which led to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Ownership of the House**: The author owns the house outright since it was given by their grandma. This means they have legal authority to modify it. However, they're in a relationship with the fianc\u00e9, and she's upset about the decision.\n\n2. **Use of Bonus Money**: The bonus was a five-figure amount. The author views it as \"found money\" because they didn't expect it and it's a one-time thing. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it's irresponsible not to use it for shared financial goals like wedding expenses, paying off debt, or saving.\n\n3. **Impact on the Relationship**: The fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she moved out and is considering ending the engagement. The author argues that it's their house and they have the right to do what they want, but this action has caused significant strain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, they have the right to modify their home. Financially, the bonus is their income, so they have the right to spend it. However, in a relationship, especially when planning to get married, financial decisions can be a shared responsibility. The fianc\u00e9 feels that major financial decisions should be discussed together, which the author didn't do. \n\nThe author didn't consult their partner on how to use the bonus, which is a big deal when you're engaged. Even though the money is their own, the action of modifying the house affects both of them, especially if it's causing them to live in an uncomfortable environment. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about shared financial planning (wedding costs, debt, savings) are valid points that the author dismissed by calling the money \"found.\"\n\nSo while the author isn't legally wrong, in a relationship context, not considering the partner's feelings and financial priorities could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. The fact that the project caused her to move out and consider ending the engagement shows the severity of the impact. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective, even if they had the right to make the decision.\n"
