Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author received a five-figure bonus after a period of unemployment and decided to use it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about this, leading to potential relationship issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns the house outright, received a bonus they considered as \"found money,\" and made the decision to spend it on a personal project without consulting their fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she believes the money should have been used for more practical purposes, like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it was their money and their house, so they had the right to spend it as they pleased.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, using a bonus for a personal project might be seen as irresponsible if there are shared financial obligations or if the fianc\u00e9e wasn't consulted. However, the bonus was a one-time, unexpected windfall. The author might feel they had the right to use it as they wished, especially since the house is their own.\n\nBut relationships often require compromise and communication. Even if the author has legal ownership of the house, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and the impact on their wedding plans are significant. The fact that the author made a major renovation without discussing it with their partner could be seen as a lack of consideration, which is a common AITA issue. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme (thinking about calling off the wedding), but her concerns are valid in terms of financial planning and shared goals.\n\nThe author's argument that it's \"found money\" might hold weight, but the execution\u2014undertaking a large project without discussion\u2014could be the problem. In many relationship advice scenarios, transparency and mutual decision-making are emphasized, even when one partner has the legal right to make certain choices. The fact that the renovation has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9e adds another layer of conflict, as it affects their living situation.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for spending their bonus, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's perspective might place some responsibility on them. However, the fianc\u00e9e's extreme reaction could also be seen as over-the-top. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line by not involving their partner in a major financial decision that affects both of them, especially in the context of an impending marriage.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the side that's more inconsiderate of the other's feelings gets the \"asshole\" label. Here, the author might be seen as not considering the fianc\u00e9e's concerns, even if they had the right to spend their own money. The renovation's impact on their shared life (wedding plans, living situation) is significant and might tip the balance towards the author being in the wrong for not discussing it beforehand.\n"
