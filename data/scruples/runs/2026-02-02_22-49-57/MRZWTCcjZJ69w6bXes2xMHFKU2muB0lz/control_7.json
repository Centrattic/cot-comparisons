Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after starting a good job. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright because it was given to them by their grandma when she died. They hired a contractor to do the work, which involved tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think using the bonus was irresponsible and that they should have used the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The fianc\u00e9 is so angry that she's moved in with her sister and considering calling off the wedding. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and that it's their house, so they have the right to do what they want with it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. The author owns the house outright, so from a legal standpoint, they can make changes without permission. However, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the situation, and they're planning to get married. Maybe there's an expectation of shared financial decisions here. Even if the house is in the author's name, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that major home renovations should be discussed together, especially if the work is causing them to be unable to live there.\n\nFinancial responsibility is another angle. The bonus is a windfall, but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as money that could be used for necessary expenses like paying off debt or wedding costs. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a one-time opportunity to do something fun. This is a common point of contention in relationships\u2014how to allocate unexpected money.\n\nCommunication is a big factor. The author might have thought they had the right to spend their bonus as they pleased, but the fianc\u00e9 felt left out of the decision-making process. The fact that the renovation has made the house temporarily uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to her frustration. Even if the author had the legal right to do the work, the lack of discussion could have been hurtful.\n\nLong-term relationship impact is also important. The fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding over this issue, which shows that the disagreement is causing significant strain. The author might not have realized how important it was for them to be on the same page regarding finances and home decisions. In a committed relationship, especially one moving toward marriage, major financial decisions can affect the stability of the partnership.\n\nSo, putting this all together: Legally, the author isn't wrong because they own the house. But in terms of relationship dynamics and financial planning, there's a strong argument that the author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and needs. The secret room was a personal project, but the financial and emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9 was significant. The author didn't discuss the use of the bonus, leading to a major conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because despite legal ownership, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's concerns is a key issue in relationships, especially pre-marital.\n"
