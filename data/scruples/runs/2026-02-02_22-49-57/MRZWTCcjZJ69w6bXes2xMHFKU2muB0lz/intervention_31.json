Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which was supposed to be a fun project but has caused a major argument with their partner. The partner is angry and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They used that bonus to hire a contractor to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, a circular staircase to a new basement. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal authority to make changes. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for debt, wedding expenses, or savings. The author argues that the bonus was found money and they wanted to enjoy it. The argument has escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved out and they might break up.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author had a bonus, which they considered as \"found money,\" and decided to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 feels that major financial decisions should be discussed together, especially since they are engaged and planning to get married. The author's actions made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 because of the construction.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they might feel they have the right to use their own money as they see fit, especially since they own the house. However, in a committed relationship, especially one that's about to become a marriage, big financial decisions that affect the shared living space can be seen as needing mutual agreement. The fact that the author didn't discuss this with their fianc\u00e9 might be a problem. Even though the bonus is the author's income, using it for such a project without considering the partner's perspective could lead to conflict.\n\nAdditionally, the project's impact on their living situation is significant. Tearing down walls and digging up the foundation would make the house uncomfortable or even unusable for the fianc\u00e9, which adds to the tension. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for shared responsibilities like the wedding or debt might be valid, especially if they expected the bonus to contribute to those goals.\n\nThe author's justification that they wanted to have fun with the money is understandable, but in a relationship, especially a marriage, shared financial planning is important. The decision to proceed without discussion shows a lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and expectations. This could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, leading the author to be in the wrong.\n"
