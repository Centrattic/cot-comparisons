Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a rift with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which their fianc\u00e9e is upset about. The fianc\u00e9e argues that the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author counters that the bonus was a one-time thing and that they wanted to have fun with it. The fianc\u00e9e is now considering breaking off the engagement and has moved in with her sister because the construction is making living in the house difficult.\n\nSo the key points here are financial responsibility, shared expectations in a relationship, and the impact of the decision on the relationship. The author owns the house outright, so legally they have the right to modify it. However, in a relationship, especially when engaged, financial decisions can be a shared responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's anger stems from the lack of discussion and the impractical use of funds when they have other financial goals. The author's defense is that it's their house and the bonus was a one-time gain.\n\nBut in relationships, even if one partner owns property, major expenses that affect both partners (like home renovations) should ideally be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is considering calling off the wedding suggests that this isn't just about money but about communication and respect for each other's priorities. The author may not be considering the fianc\u00e9e's perspective and the shared future they're planning. The construction is also causing immediate issues in their living situation, adding to her frustration.\n\nSo while the author isn't legally wrong, in the context of a committed relationship, the decision might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, not because of the use of the bonus itself, but because they didn't communicate and consider the fianc\u00e9e's concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme, but her point about shared financial planning is valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from a relational standpoint, even if they have their own justifications.\n"
