Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room, which led to a big fight with the fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work. They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their choice since it's their house.\n\nHmm. The key points here are shared financial responsibility and communication. The author might feel it's their right to use their bonus, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision since they're getting married. Even though the house is the author's, major renovations can affect both partners, especially if living conditions are impacted. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 moved out and they're considering ending the engagement suggests a bigger issue than just the money. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally, but in a relationship, major financial decisions usually require discussion. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which could be a problem. The bonus is their money, but using it for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective can cause conflict. \n\nSo, whether it's right or wrong depends on relationship dynamics. The author's actions might not be illegal, but in terms of relationship responsibility, they might have acted without proper communication. So, the answer could be A (Yes) because they didn't discuss it with their partner, even though they have the right to use their own money. However, others might say it's their choice. But given the severity of the outcome (engagement in jeopardy), maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering their partner's concerns. \n\nWait, but the author mentions it's their house, so maybe they have the right to do what they want. However, in a committed relationship, especially planning to get married, such a large expense should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid too. The author's action caused significant stress and conflict. So, maybe the answer is A because they didn't communicate properly, even if they have the legal right.\n"
