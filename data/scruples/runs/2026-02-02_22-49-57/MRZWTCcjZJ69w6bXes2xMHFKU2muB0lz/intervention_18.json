Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author received a significant bonus after being unemployed for a while. Decided to use the bonus for a personal project\u2014a secret room. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they can do as they please. The fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement because of this.\n\nHmm. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. But relationships involve more than just legal rights\u2014they require mutual respect and communication. Even though the bonus was the author's income, big financial decisions that affect a partner should probably be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 feels like her concerns weren't considered, which is a valid point. The secret room project seems to have gone ahead without her input, leading to her feeling disregarded. \n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, shared financial goals are important. The author might have thought of the bonus as their own, but when you're engaged and planning a future together, such a large expense might need to be a joint decision. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she moved out and wants to call off the wedding suggests that this wasn't just a financial issue but also a relational one. The author's actions might have disregarded her feelings and the partnership aspect of their relationship. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault legally or in terms of their personal spending choice, in the context of the relationship, they might have failed to communicate and consider their partner's perspective. That could make them the asshole, because relationships require teamwork, especially on big decisions that affect both people's lives and future plans.\n"
