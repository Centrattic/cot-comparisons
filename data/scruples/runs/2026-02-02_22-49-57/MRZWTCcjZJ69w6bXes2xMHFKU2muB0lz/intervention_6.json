Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after several years of being unemployed, which is probably a significant amount of money. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright because it was given to them by their grandma when she passed away. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think it's irresponsible, considering the cost of the project. They argue that the money could have been used for debt, the wedding, or savings. The author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 is now so angry she moved out and is thinking of calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are ownership of the house and the bonus, the financial decision, and the relationship impact. The author does own the house, so legally they can do what they want with it. The bonus was a one-time thing, so maybe they see it as an opportunity to spend on something they really wanted. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels it's a misuse of funds, especially for shared goals like the wedding and debt. \n\nBut even if the author has the right to spend their own money, relationships often require compromise. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 about this big project, which might have been a mistake. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that they can't live in the house anymore suggests that the project has major implications on their shared living situation. If they had discussed it beforehand, maybe they could have found a middle ground. \n\nAlso, the author is getting married, so financial planning usually involves both partners. Using a bonus for a personal project without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective might come off as selfish. Even if the money is their own, the project affects the home they're supposed to build together. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the bonus for the wedding or debt are valid, as those are common shared financial goals. \n\nThe author's argument that it's a one-time bonus is a point, but if it's a five-figure amount, it's not insignificant. While it's not a regular income, it's still part of their finances. The contractor work seems extensive\u2014torn walls, digging up the foundation. That must be expensive, and the fianc\u00e9 might feel it's a reckless expenditure without considering their joint future. \n\nSo, even though the author has the legal right to use their money and house as they see fit, in a relationship context, communication is key. Failing to discuss such a major decision with the fianc\u00e9 could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions might be the root of that. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not involving their partner in the decision-making process.\n"
