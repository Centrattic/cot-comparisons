Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which the other partner is upset about.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus from a job they got after being out of steady work. The bonus is described as a one-time, five-figure amount. They used this money to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is angry because they think the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. The fianc\u00e9 now can't live in the house due to the construction and is considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author argues the bonus was \"found money\" and that they had the right to use it as they wished since they own the house. However, in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married, major financial decisions might require mutual agreement. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding with the project, which led to significant stress and potential relationship breakdown.\n\nEven though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is part of their life, and such a large expenditure that affects the home they share could be seen as needing discussion. The fact that the construction made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" might overlook the shared commitment of marriage, where joint decision-making is typically expected.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify their property, the emotional and relational impact here suggests that they might have been unreasonable in not considering their fianc\u00e9's perspective and financial priorities. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and their actions caused significant harm to the relationship.\n"
