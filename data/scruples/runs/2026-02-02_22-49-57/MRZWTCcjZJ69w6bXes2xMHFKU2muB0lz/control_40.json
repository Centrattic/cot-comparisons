Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work and received a bonus. They decided to use the bonus for a personal project. The key points here are that they own the house legally and have the right to modify it. The contractor work started, which involved significant changes like tearing walls and digging the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling the money should have been used for shared goals like debt, wedding costs, or savings. She's even moved in with her sister and considers ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the arguments: The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" and had the legal right to spend it. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels this was irresponsible and uncommunicated. The project has disrupted her living situation, making it hard to live in the house. \n\nEven though the author has legal ownership, relationships involve shared decision-making. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid because major financial decisions should be discussed, especially when planning to marry. The fact that the project started without discussion led to significant stress and possible relationship breakdown. The author might not be legally wrong, but in terms of relationship responsibility, their actions were dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns, leading to conflict. So, the answer leans towards A.\n"
