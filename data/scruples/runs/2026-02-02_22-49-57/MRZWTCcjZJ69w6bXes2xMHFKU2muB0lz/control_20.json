Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from their job. They used it to build a secret room, which involves tearing down walls and digging into the foundation of their spare bedroom. The house was given to them by their grandma, and they own it outright. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. She mentions that they could have used the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. They also mention that the fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the engagement is a result of this conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and the impact on the relationship. The author had the legal right to use the house as they wanted and the bonus was their money. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that the decision was made without proper discussion, which is a problem in a relationship. Even though the author might have the right to spend the money, not considering their partner's financial concerns and future plans could be seen as selfish or a lack of teamwork. \n\nThe secret room project has caused significant changes to the house, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there. This is a major disruption. The author might not have thought about how this project affects their partner's daily life and the relationship. Even if the money was a bonus, in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, big financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The fact that the author didn't consult with their fianc\u00e9 and went ahead with the project could be seen as the main issue here. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily doing something illegal, the lack of communication and consideration for their partner's perspective might make them the asshole in the situation. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and future financial planning are valid, and the author dismissing them as a way to justify using the bonus could have contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
