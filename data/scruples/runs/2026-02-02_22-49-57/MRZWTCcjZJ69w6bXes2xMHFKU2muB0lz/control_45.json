Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while and received a five-figure bonus. They decided to use this bonus to build a secret room, which they've always wanted. They own the house outright since it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She moved in with her sister and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had the legal right to modify the house, and the bonus was a one-time windfall. However, the relationship aspect is crucial. Even though the author had the financial freedom, major life decisions, especially those affecting a partner, usually require mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9 feels that this decision was made without her input, leading to the current conflict.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus is \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for fun. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that they should have discussed it. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for her adds to the problem. While the author might have the legal right, relationships often require considering each other's perspectives. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which could be seen as a breach of communication and partnership. Even if the author had the right to do it, the way they made the decision without involving their partner is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the main issue isn't about legality but about not discussing major financial and home modifications with a fianc\u00e9, leading to relationship strain. The author should have considered their partner's feelings and needs, especially since they're planning to marry, which implies shared decision-making.\n"
