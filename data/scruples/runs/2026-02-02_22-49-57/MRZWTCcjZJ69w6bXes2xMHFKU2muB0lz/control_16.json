Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they got a big bonus and used it to create a secret room with a bookshelf door. Their fianc\u00e9 is really upset and considering breaking off the wedding. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they were unemployed for a while and got a good job with a significant bonus. They used the bonus to hire a contractor to modify their house. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is angry because they could have used the bonus for more practical things like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and it's their house, so they have the right to do what they want with it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author had a financial windfall and decided to spend it on a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 feels it was irresponsible and that the decision was made without considering their shared future. Even though the house is the author's, they're engaged, which implies a partnership. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about the wedding and debt might be valid, especially if they were discussed before. \n\nThe author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big financial commitment, which could be a problem. Even if the bonus is their own money, major projects in a shared home can affect both partners. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels the need to move out and call off the wedding suggests a serious breakdown in communication or mutual respect.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily wrong, the lack of discussion and consideration of the fianc\u00e9's priorities might make them the asshole here. The project's impact on their relationship is significant. The answer might lean towards A, but it's a bit of a toss-up. But since the author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and it's causing such a big issue, maybe they are in the wrong.\n"
