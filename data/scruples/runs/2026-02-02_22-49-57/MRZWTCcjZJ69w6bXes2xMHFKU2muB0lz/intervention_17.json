Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took a bonus and used it to build a secret room in their house, which has caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for other purposes like paying debt, the wedding, or saving. The author feels it's their right since it's their house and the bonus was \"found money.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author did own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want with it. The bonus was unexpected, so the author might see it as a personal reward after a tough job search. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that major financial decisions should be discussed together since they're planning to get married. The project is causing them to live separately now, which adds emotional strain.\n\nThe key points here are communication and shared financial planning. Even though the author had the legal right to use their bonus, relationships often require mutual agreement on significant expenses. The author might not have considered that the fianc\u00e9 expected them to discuss such a big project, especially since it affects the entire house and their future together. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows how much this issue is hurting the relationship.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily doing something illegal or unethical, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's perspective might make them the asshole in the context of the relationship. In relationships, especially when planning marriage, major decisions that impact both partners should be made together. The author's actions, though legally justified, might come off as selfish or dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns.\n"
