Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author received a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues the bonus was a one-time opportunity and the house is theirs to modify. The relationship is now in jeopardy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. \n\nConsidering the factors: The author owns the house, so legally, they can make changes. The bonus was a one-time thing, so the author's perspective is to enjoy it. However, the fianc\u00e9 isn't happy, and this is a major financial decision that affects their shared life. Even though the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that big projects should be discussed together, especially when planning to get married. The argument is about communication and financial priorities. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which could be a point of contention. \n\nIn relationships, especially when engaged, major financial decisions can be seen as affecting both partners. Even if the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the bonus for other shared goals might be valid. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the engagement shows the severity. \n\nSo while the author might have the right to spend the money as they like, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's perspective could make them the asshole. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because it's about shared life planning and not discussing a significant expense with their partner.\n"
