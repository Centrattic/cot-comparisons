Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a rift with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work, received a bonus, and used it for a personal project. They own the house, so legally they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved out and might end the wedding.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author might think they have the right to spend their bonus as they choose, especially since they own the house. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major home renovations without discussion are a problem. They're engaged, so maybe there's an expectation of shared financial planning. The fact that the renovations made the house uninhabitable adds to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, using the bonus is their right, but not discussing major decisions with a partner can be problematic. Even if you own the house, making significant changes that affect the relationship and living conditions without consultation can be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs might be valid shared financial goals. The author's stance of \"it's my house\" might dismiss the partner's feelings, which could be the real issue here. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and not discussing the decision beforehand.\n"
