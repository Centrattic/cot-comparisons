Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got a big bonus and decided to build a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9e is upset and wants to call off the wedding. The author owns the house outright and used their own bonus, but the fianc\u00e9e feels it was irresponsible.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house, so they have the legal right to make changes. But the relationship aspect complicates things. The bonus is described as \"found money\" that might not come again, which is a common argument for splurging. However, the fianc\u00e9e is part of the household, and major home renovations can be disruptive. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e before making such a big decision, which could be a problem in a relationship. Even though it's their house, relationships often involve shared financial and living decisions, especially when planning to get married. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is considering ending the engagement shows how serious the issue is. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but in terms of relationship dynamics, not discussing the project with their partner could be seen as selfish or dismissive of her concerns. The contractor work is already underway, making it hard to reverse, but the lack of communication is a key point here. So, while the author isn't necessarily a jerk for wanting to use their bonus, they might be in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9e in the decision, especially since they're planning to marry. The answer might be B (No) because they aren't in the wrong legally or financially, but there's a case for A (Yes) regarding relationship responsibilities. Hmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author isn't, but I'm torn. The key factors are ownership vs. shared decisions in the relationship. Since the author owns the house and used their own bonus, maybe B is correct. But if they didn't consider their partner's feelings, maybe A. It's a tough call. I think the main issue is the lack of communication and not respecting the partner's input in a relationship that's moving towards marriage. So maybe A is the right answer here.\n"
