Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe user is a fianc\u00e9 who got a job after being out of work for a few years. They received a five-figure bonus. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright (inherited from their grandma). They hired a contractor, started tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, saying it's irresponsible and they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt or the wedding. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved in with her sister and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author owns the house, so legally, they have the right to make changes. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset that the bonus, which was supposed to be shared resources as they are getting married, was used without discussion. The author's reasoning is that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing, so they wanted to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible because they have joint financial responsibilities (wedding, debt, etc.), and the construction is making it hard for her to live there.\n\nSo, the main issues are financial decision-making in a relationship and communication. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations that affect shared living space and use significant funds might require discussion. The bonus was part of their combined finances since they're engaged and planning a shared future. Using it without considering the partner's perspective could be seen as not being considerate of their shared goals. The author's stance is about personal desire versus the fianc\u00e9's practical concerns. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she's considering ending the engagement suggests that the author's actions have caused significant harm to the relationship, regardless of legal ownership. \n\nIn relationships, especially when engaged and planning to marry, major financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The author may have acted unilaterally without considering the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about shared responsibilities. Even if legally they can do it, the social and relational implications are significant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in terms of not communicating and not considering the partner's viewpoint, even if legally they have the right.\n"
