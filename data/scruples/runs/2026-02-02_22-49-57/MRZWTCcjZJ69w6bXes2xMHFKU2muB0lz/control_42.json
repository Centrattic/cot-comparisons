Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room, leading to a fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. She's even moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are ownership of the house and financial responsibility. The author owns the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels her input wasn't considered, which is a relationship issue. Even though the bonus was \"found money,\" using it for a personal project without discussing it with a partner can be seen as selfish, especially when it affects their shared living space and financial plans.\n\nThe author argues it's their house, but since they're engaged, major decisions might require mutual agreement. The fact that the project made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. While the author has legal rights, the relationship aspect is about communication and shared goals. The fianc\u00e9's anger is valid because the decision impacted their future plans together. So, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the project and the bonus usage beforehand, even if they had the legal right to do it.\n"
