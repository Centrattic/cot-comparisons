Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which the fianc\u00e9e is upset about.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room with a contractor, which involved structural changes. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal rights to modify it. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they could have used the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. She's so upset she moved out and might end the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author's actions were their own decision, but since they're engaged, financial decisions can be joint. Even though the house is the author's, major renovations can affect the entire household. The fianc\u00e9e feels the decision was made without mutual discussion, which is important in a committed relationship. The argument is intense enough that it's causing a break-up. \n\nThe bonus is referred to as \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9e argues it's irresponsible. While the author has the legal right to use their bonus as they wish, relationships require compromise. Not discussing major financial decisions that impact the living situation might be seen as selfish, especially when it causes such conflict. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't legally wrong, in a relationship context, not considering the partner's perspective and needs could make them at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e on a significant expense that affects both of them and caused major strain.\n"
