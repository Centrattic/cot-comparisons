Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used their bonus money to create a secret room in their house, which really upset their fianc\u00e9. They ended up in a huge argument, and she moved in with her sister, considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a bonus after being unemployed for a few years, which they see as \"found money.\" They used it for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want with it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She feels it's irresponsible, and the construction has made living in the house impossible for her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. Legally, the author has the right to their bonus and the house. They didn't steal or break any laws. The project was their idea, and they had the money to do it. However, relationships often involve more than just legal rights; they involve communication and mutual respect. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big decision. Even though it's their money, a major renovation affecting the entire house without discussing it with their partner could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and financial priorities.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they are getting married, implying shared financial responsibilities. She wanted to use the bonus for practical purposes, which could have been a joint decision. The author's argument is that it's their money to spend as they like, but relationships often require compromise. The fact that the construction made living in the house impossible adds another layer\u2014without discussing the impact on her daily life.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the issue is more about the relationship dynamics. The key here is communication. They didn't talk about financial plans or priorities, which is a big deal in a marriage. The author's actions might be seen as selfish, not considering their partner's needs and the future of their marriage. Even if the money is theirs, in a committed relationship, big decisions like this should involve both partners.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate adequately, didn't consider their partner's perspective, and the action caused significant distress in the relationship. The fact that it's their money doesn't absolve them of the responsibility to discuss major financial commitments with a fianc\u00e9, especially when it affects the shared home and future plans.\n"
