Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who took their bonus to create a secret room is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation: The author got a job after being out of work for a while, received a five-figure bonus. They wanted a secret room in their house, hired a contractor, started renovations. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinks it's irresponsible, wants the money used for debt or wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is so mad she's moved out and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility and relationship dynamics. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But the problem is that this is a shared living situation with a fianc\u00e9. Even though it's the author's house, the fianc\u00e9 is affected by the renovations and the financial decision. \n\nThe bonus is a one-time thing, so the author might see it as a windfall. But the fianc\u00e9 sees it as money that could be used for shared goals, like paying off debt or wedding expenses. That's a common conflict in relationships. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making the decision, which probably made her feel disrespected. \n\nEven though the author has the legal right to spend the money, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The fact that the renovations are making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds another layer. She can't live there comfortably, which is a big issue. \n\nThe author might argue it's their house, but when you're engaged, there's an expectation of shared financial planning. Not discussing major expenses could be seen as selfish. The author's actions led to a breakdown in the relationship, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily doing something illegal, they might be at fault for not considering their fianc\u00e9's perspective and not communicating properly. The decision impacted both of them, and the lack of discussion is a problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions contributed to the conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and their decision affected their fianc\u00e9 without her input.\n"
