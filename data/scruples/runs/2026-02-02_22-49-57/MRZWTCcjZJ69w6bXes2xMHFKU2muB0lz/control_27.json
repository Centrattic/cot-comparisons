Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which they own. They mention the bonus was unexpected and might not happen again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thought they should use the money for more practical purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding. She's even moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nFirst, the house is owned by the author, so legally, they have the right to modify it. But relationships involve shared decisions. The key issue is whether the author should have discussed the bonus usage with their fianc\u00e9 first. Even though the money is theirs, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The author didn't consult her, leading to a big conflict. The fianc\u00e9 feels disrespected and financially insecure. The secret room is causing them to live uncomfortably in their home, which adds stress. The author's argument is about using \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid about financial planning and shared responsibilities. Moving in with her sister is a sign of severe distress. The author might not be the sole wrongdoer, but they definitely contributed to the problem by making a unilateral decision. So, it's a relationship breakdown partly due to the author's actions. Answer A.\n"
