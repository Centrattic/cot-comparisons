Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big conflict.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from their new job after being unemployed for a while. They wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement staircase. They own the house outright because it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's irresponsible and that they should have discussed using the bonus for debt, the wedding, or savings. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved out and might end the engagement.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author owned the house, they used their bonus (which they consider found money), and the fianc\u00e9 didn't agree with the decision. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this without discussing it first.\n\nHmm. The author has legal authority over the house, so there's no legal wrong there. The bonus was a one-time event, so using it for a personal project could be seen as a personal choice. However, it's a significant relationship issue. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is a partner, and major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which might have been a mistake. The contractor work is also a big deal since it affects the entire house and their living situation. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input was ignored, which could be a valid point. But the author might think they had the right to use their own money. \n\nBalancing both perspectives: the author's desire vs. the fianc\u00e9's expectations in a relationship. In most relationships, big purchases or renovations that affect shared space should be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how serious this is. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but relationship-wise, not discussing it could be seen as a breach of trust or communication. So maybe the answer is A because the author didn't consider their partner's feelings and important financial discussions, even if it's their own property. But some might argue B, that it's their own money and house, so they have the right. But the key is the lack of communication, which often leads to being the asshole in such scenarios.\n"
