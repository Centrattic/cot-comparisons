Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, and started renovations. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think it's irresponsible to use the bonus for a luxury instead of paying off debts, wedding costs, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they can do with it as they like. The fianc\u00e9 is so angry she moved out and might end the engagement.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, since the house is owned by the author and they were the sole earner of the bonus, they have the right to use their money as they wish. However, relationships involve shared responsibilities and communication. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Communication**: Did they discuss financial plans before spending the bonus? The author mentions the fianc\u00e9 is thinking of calling off the wedding because this wasn't discussed. If major financial decisions aren't communicated, that can be a problem in a relationship, especially when planning to marry. Even if legally they can make the decision, in a committed relationship, financial decisions often require mutual agreement.\n\n2. **Impact on the Relationship**: The renovation is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading her to move out. This is a significant disruption, which might be more than just a financial disagreement. The author might not have considered how the project affects their partner's living situation.\n\n3. **Priorities and Values**: The author prioritized a personal desire (secret room) over shared financial goals (debt, wedding, savings). While the bonus is a windfall, the fianc\u00e9 feels it should be used for practical purposes. This clash in financial values is causing a major rift. The author's stance is about personal freedom with their money, but in a relationship, especially pre-marital, shared financial planning is usually expected.\n\n4. **Respect and Compromise**: The author insists it's their house and their money, but relationships require compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her concerns about shared financial responsibilities are valid. The author may not have respected her perspective sufficiently.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be seen as in the wrong not because they spent their money, but because they didn't communicate and consider their partner's feelings and the shared future. Even if legally and financially they have the right, the relationship aspect demands more discussion and mutual decision-making. The fact that the project is causing immediate living issues exacerbates the problem. So, while the author isn't necessarily a jerk, the way they handled the situation contributed to the conflict. However, AITA often considers the relational aspect more than legal rights. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the lack of communication and the significant impact on the relationship.\n"
