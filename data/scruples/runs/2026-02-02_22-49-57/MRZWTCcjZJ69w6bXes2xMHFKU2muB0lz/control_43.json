Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that they should have used the money for paying off debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's their house and the bonus is a one-time thing.\n\nFirst, legal ownership is a point here. The house was given to the author, so they have legal rights. But relationships involve shared responsibilities and communication. The bonus is a one-time event, but using it for a personal project might conflict with shared financial goals, especially since they're planning to get married. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision, which makes sense because marriage involves combining finances. The author didn't consult, which could be a problem. The project's scale is causing them to move out, leading to a possible breakup. \n\nEven though the author has the legal right, relationships require mutual agreement on major financial decisions. The key issue here is lack of communication and considering the partner's perspective. The author's actions, while legally justified, might be seen as selfish given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding expenses, and future savings are valid financial priorities. So, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the bonus use beforehand and dismissing the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns. Answer A.\n"
