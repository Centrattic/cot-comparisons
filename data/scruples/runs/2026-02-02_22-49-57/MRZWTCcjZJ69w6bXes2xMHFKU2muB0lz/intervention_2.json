Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight leading to possible engagement break-up.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for years. They decided to use it for a personal project they've always wanted. The house is owned by the author, so they have legal right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they thought the money should be used for other purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they can do what they want.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author has the legal right to use their bonus as they see fit. They might feel entitled to enjoy the money after working hard to get the job. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that major home modifications without discussion could be irresponsible, especially if they have shared financial goals. The fact that the author didn't consult them might be the issue here. The project is causing significant disruption, making the fianc\u00e9 unable to live in the house. Even if the author has the right, relationships often require communication and compromise. Not discussing such a big expense, especially when planning to get married, might be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's lack of communication could be a key point. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the impact on their relationship.\n"
