Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus that might not be recurring. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. The house is theirs, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, they're engaged, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for other priorities like debt, wedding expenses, or savings. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, leading to her moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are about shared financial decisions in a relationship. Even though the bonus is the author's, major financial decisions usually require communication, especially when it affects the shared home. The author might not be legally wrong, but ethically, they might have overlooked their partner's concerns. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement because the author didn't discuss the plan with her first suggests that the issue is more about communication and mutual respect rather than legal fault. So, while the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" legally, in terms of relationship dynamics and partnership, they might be seen as not considering their partner's perspective, which could make them the asshole in the situation. Answer A.\n"
