      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, the author found out, the relationship ended. Now the ex is with someone new, and the author told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with her as a result. The ex and her friends are upset, but the author's friends don't believe them because they've been swayed by the ex's side.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, there's a few angles here. Legally, there's nothing illegal about sharing that information. But ethically and morally, it's more complex. \n\nThe ex cheated, which is a valid reason for the breakup. The author's action was to inform the new partner about the past infidelity. The key question here is whether the author had the right to do that. On one hand, the author might feel they're protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. On the other hand, the ex's past relationship doesn't directly involve the new boyfriend, so sharing that information could be seen as interfering.\n\nThere's also the context of the breakup being messy, with the ex lying and stealing friends. The author's motivation might be revenge or a desire for the new boyfriend to know the truth. However, the method of sharing the information\u2014emailing the new boyfriend\u2014might be considered meddling. \n\nAnother point is that the author's ex-friends don't believe the author's side, which complicates things. The author might feel vindicated if the new boyfriend left, but it's possible that the ex's lies have already influenced others. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about intent and consequences. If the author's intent was to share a truth that they believe the new boyfriend should know, but the method was without consent and caused direct harm (the breakup), that's where the ethical dilemma lies. Some might argue it's justified to prevent the new boyfriend from being lied to again. Others might say it's not their place to intervene, and that the new boyfriend should have done his own vetting. \n\nIn many cases, people consider that sharing someone's past mistakes without their consent, especially to their partner, can be seen as crossing a line. Even if the information is true, the act of disclosing it without the ex's permission or the new partner's right to know (unless it's directly relevant) might be viewed as wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, might be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
