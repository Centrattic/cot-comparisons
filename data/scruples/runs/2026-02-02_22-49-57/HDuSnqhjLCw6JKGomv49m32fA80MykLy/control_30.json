I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person broke up with their ex because the ex cheated. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the author told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The ex and the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author found out that their ex cheated, ended the relationship, and then told the new boyfriend. The author's reasoning is that if they were in the new boyfriend's position, they'd want to know if their new partner had cheated before. But did the author have the right to share that information?\n\nWell, the ex had a right to privacy, even after the breakup. Even though they're not together anymore, revealing past infidelity might be seen as crossing a line. The author didn't ask the ex for permission or anything; they just shared it directly with the new BF. That could be considered meddling, especially if it led to the new relationship ending. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation might matter. Were they trying to protect the new BF? Or were they seeking revenge for the cheating? If it's the latter, that could make their actions more about getting back at the ex rather than helping the new BF. \n\nAnother angle is that the author might be taking justice into their own hands. The new BF might have the right to know, but the way the information was delivered could be problematic. The author didn't give the ex a chance to explain her side again or let the new BF find out on his own terms. \n\nAdditionally, the author's ex-friends don't know the truth because they believe the ex's version. The author might feel justified in telling the new BF, thinking that giving the BF the full story is fair. But sharing personal information about someone's past could be seen as violating their privacy, regardless of the context.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the breakup being ugly and the ex stealing friends. The author might feel vindictive, and this action could be part of that. However, even if the ex did wrong, the author's method of responding could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information about their ex without her consent, leading to the new relationship ending. Even if the information was true, sharing it directly with the new BF could be seen as an invasion of privacy and meddling in someone else's relationship.\n"
