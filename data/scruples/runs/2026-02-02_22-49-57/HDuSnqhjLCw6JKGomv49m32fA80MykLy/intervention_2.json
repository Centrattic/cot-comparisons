I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The situation is that the ex cheated on them, they found out, the breakup was messy, and then the author sent an email to the new boyfriend. The ex and some of the author's friends are now calling them an asshole. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author discovered their ex cheated, confronted her, and broke up. Then, after hearing about a new relationship, they contacted the new boyfriend with the information. The key points are: did the author have the right to share that information?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the new boyfriend deserved to know about the ex's past infidelity. They might believe it's important for the new relationship's transparency. On the other hand, the author was not directly involved in the new relationship, so interfering could be seen as overstepping. The author could have personal motives, like wanting revenge or preventing the new boyfriend from being hurt, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action.\n\nLegal and ethical standards usually require informed consent. The ex had a right to privacy, and the author sharing that information without her consent could be problematic. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method of sharing private information might be considered a breach of trust or privacy. Additionally, the ex's side of the story isn't fully known. Maybe there were extenuating circumstances or the author's account is biased.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of the information, which could have consequences. The author's actions might have caused unnecessary harm. Also, the author's friends believing the ex's version suggests that the author's communication about the situation might not have been effective, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might have a valid grievance, but the way they handled it could be questioned. The right to privacy and autonomy in relationships is important. The new boyfriend's right to know is balanced against the ex's right to privacy. However, the author isn't in a position to act as a gatekeeper of information about the ex's past.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's action could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if their intentions were to protect the new boyfriend. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, which is generally considered unethical.\n"
