I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling the new boyfriend of their ex that she cheated. \n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them, and the author found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Then, five months later, the ex starts dating someone new. The author decides to email this new guy about the cheating. The new guy breaks up with the ex because of this, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole. The author's friends don't believe the ex cheated because they were swayed by the ex's side.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author feels that the new boyfriend has a right to know about the ex's infidelity. They might think they're protecting him from being cheated on. But on the other hand, the author is directly interfering in their ex's new relationship, which could be seen as vindictive or crossing a privacy line. \n\nConsider ethical perspectives. If you believe everyone has the right to privacy, the author violated his ex's privacy by sharing personal information. However, if you value honesty and transparency in relationships, the author might think it's justified. \n\nAlso, the context matters. The ex had already lied and stolen friends, which might have made the author feel justified. But retaliating by exposing someone else's past, even if true, can be harmful. The new boyfriend wasn't part of the original relationship, so the author didn't owe him that information. \n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might have caused more harm than good. The new relationship ended because of the author's intervention, which could leave the new boyfriend with negative feelings towards the ex without her having a chance to explain. The ex's friends not believing the author's side might be because the author didn't approach them directly, but that's another issue.\n\nIn many cases, people advise not to interfere in ex's new relationships, as it can lead to further conflict and doesn't resolve the past issues. The author's action might be seen as taking revenge rather than moving on. Even if the information is true, sharing it without considering the consequences could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they chose to interfere in a new relationship with information that isn't their place to share, leading to breakup and ongoing conflict. The right action would be to let go and not meddle, even if their intentions were to warn the new partner.\n"
