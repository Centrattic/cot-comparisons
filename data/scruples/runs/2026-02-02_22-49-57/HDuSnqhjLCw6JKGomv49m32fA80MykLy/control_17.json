I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated, and the author found out through a friend. They confronted her, ended the relationship, and now she's with a new guy. The author emailed the boyfriend to inform him about the cheating. The BF ended the relationship, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole. The ex's friends don't believe the author's side.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author felt it was important for the new BF to know because they would want to know if their GF cheated. On the other hand, the author didn't have the ex's permission to share that information. Telling someone about a partner's past cheatings without their consent could be seen as invading privacy. Even if the intention was good\u2014to protect the BF\u2014it's a personal matter. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the ex's privacy, even though the ex cheated. However, some might argue that preventing someone from being cheated on again is justified. But legally and ethically, sharing such information without consent is usually a no-go. So, the answer is A.\n"
