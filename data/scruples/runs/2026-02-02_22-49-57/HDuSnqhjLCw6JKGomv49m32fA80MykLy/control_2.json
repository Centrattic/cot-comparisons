      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and the ex lied to others and stole friends. Five months later, the author found out the ex started dating someone new. They emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with her, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole because they don't believe the ex cheated.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell the new boyfriend. Let's consider the options. The author's reasoning was that they would want to know if their new partner had cheated. But is it their place to do that? \n\nOn one hand, the author is sharing personal information that could affect the new relationship. If they had kept it to themselves, the new boyfriend might not know. By telling, the author caused the breakup, which could be seen as meddling. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because the ex had betrayed them and was lying to others. They might believe the new boyfriend had a right to know. However, sharing such information without the ex's consent could be considered an invasion of privacy, even if the ex was unfaithful. \n\nAlso, the author's friends are siding with the ex, which complicates things. The author's actions might have been motivated by anger or a desire for revenge, which could make their actions inappropriate. \n\nIn relationships, people have a right to privacy, and even if someone is wronged, spreading that information can be problematic. The author might have overstepped by directly contacting the new boyfriend instead of letting the new partner discover the truth on their own. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author's action could be seen as crossing a boundary, making them at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
