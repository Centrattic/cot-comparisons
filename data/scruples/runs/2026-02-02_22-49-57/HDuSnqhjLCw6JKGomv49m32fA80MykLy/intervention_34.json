I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex were in a 3-year relationship. The last year, the ex cheated with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted her, she confessed, and they broke up. The breakup was messy; the ex lied to friends and took them away. Now, 5 months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The author found the new BF's info and emailed him about the cheating. The BF broke up with her, and now the ex and some friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if it's A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me consider the ethics here. Tattling on someone's past to their new partner is a gray area. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner cheated. But does that justify spreading someone else's private information?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect the new BF from being cheated on again. On the other hand, they might be interfering in someone else's relationship. Even if the ex cheated, sharing that information without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. Also, the ex might have addressed the issue since the breakup, and the new BF's decision might be based on incomplete info.\n\nThe author didn't tell the BF directly but sent an anonymous email. That's a bit sneaky. If the author had approached the BF themselves and told the truth, maybe it's different, but doing it anonymously could be seen as underhanded. The ex's side of the story isn't known here; maybe she had reasons or the situation was more complex.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be acting out of spite or trying to get revenge for the lost friends and the breakup. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's actions could be considered vindictive. The new BF's decision to break up might not have been fair if he didn't hear both sides.\n\nSo, while the ex did cheat, the author's method of informing the new BF might be crossing a line. Privacy, consent, and the method of communication are factors. Telling someone their partner's past isn't inherently wrong, but doing it anonymously and without the ex's consent might make it ethically questionable. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong.\n"
