I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating incident. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, and the relationship ended. Now, five months later, the ex is in a new relationship. The author emailed the new boyfriend with the information about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and the author is now being called an asshole by the ex and her friends, who side with her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and privacy. When you end a relationship, especially one where there was cheating, there's a question of whether you have the right to share personal information about your ex with their new partner. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel justified because they believe the new boyfriend should know the truth. They might think it's about honesty and protecting the new partner from potential harm. But on the other hand, sharing such information can be seen as violating the ex's privacy and interfering in someone else's relationship. \n\nThere's also the aspect of revenge or emotional baggage. The author mentions that the ex lied and stole their friends. Maybe the author is trying to get back at the ex by spreading the information, which could make their actions seem more like retaliation than a genuine concern for the new boyfriend.\n\nLegally, unless there's some form of harassment or defamation, it's probably not a legal issue. But morally, it's a gray area. The author might have valid reasons, but the method of sharing the information without the ex's consent could be considered inappropriate. Relationships after a breakup are complex, and there's an expectation of moving on and respecting each other's privacy unless there's a legal obligation to disclose.\n\nIn many cases, people advise against interfering with an ex's new relationships because it can be seen as crossing a line. The author's action might have caused more harm than good, leading to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex, but it's unclear if that was the right outcome for the new relationship. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if their intentions were good. So, the answer might lean towards A, but there are arguments on both sides.\n"
