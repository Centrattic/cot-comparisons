I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated on the author, then lied to friends and stole them. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up. Five months later, the ex starts dating someone new. The author, thinking it's important for the new guy to know, emails him about the cheating. The boyfriend breaks up with the ex because of this. Now the ex and the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was right to do this. On one hand, the author might think they were doing the right thing by warning the new boyfriend about a potential cheater. They believe the new guy should know the truth. On the other hand, the author is interfering in their ex's new relationship, which might be considered invasive or disrespectful.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. Some might say that the author has a duty to prevent someone else from being hurt, so sharing the truth is justified. Others might argue that the author has no right to meddle in others' relationships and that the new boyfriend should have asked the ex directly instead of relying on a third party. \n\nLegal considerations aside, it's more about social norms. Telling someone about an ex's past can be seen as crossing a line, especially if the ex is now in a new relationship. The author's actions led to the breakup, which might be seen as causing unnecessary harm. Also, the ex's friends believing her side could indicate that the author's communication wasn't effective or that there's a bias in the social circle.\n\nAnother angle: The author's motivation. Were they trying to protect the new guy, or is there a personal vendetta? If it's the former, it's more understandable but still possibly wrong. If it's the latter, then it's definitely crossing a line.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is respecting privacy. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the method could be problematic. The right approach might have been to tell the new boyfriend that the ex cheated, but without being a third-party informer. Alternatively, maybe the author should have focused on their own healing instead of interfering.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author overstepped. Even with good intentions, interfering in someone else's relationship can be seen as wrong. The fact that the ex's friends don't believe the author's side suggests there might be a credibility issue or that the author's actions were seen as vindictive. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they shouldn't have shared information about the ex's past with her new partner.\n"
