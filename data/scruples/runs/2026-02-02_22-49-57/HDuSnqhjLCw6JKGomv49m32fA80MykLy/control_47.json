      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, which the author found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she confessed, and they broke up. Then, five months later, the ex started dating a new guy. The author found the new guy's info and emailed him about the cheating. The new guy broke things off with the ex because of this, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author had valid information about the ex's infidelity, which led to their breakup. The author then passed this information to the ex's new boyfriend without being asked. The ex's friends are taking her side, possibly because they don't know the truth from the author's side.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no law against sharing information like this, but ethically and socially, it's more complicated. The author's intention was to warn the new boyfriend, thinking they'd want to know about their partner's past. But by doing so, the author might be seen as interfering in another relationship, even if they had a reason.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they were the victim of cheating and wanted to protect the new boyfriend from a pattern. On the other hand, sharing private information without consent can be considered a breach of privacy, even if the information is true. The ex's cheating was part of their past relationship, and the new boyfriend might not have a right to know unless the ex was untruthful about her past.\n\nAlso, the author's friends are taking the ex's side, which could be due to the ex's manipulation or the friends not knowing the full story. The author's action of informing the new boyfriend might have been a way to seek some form of justice or closure, but it's a grey area.\n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the new boyfriend directly. Even if the information is true, it's not their place to share it, as it can damage relationships and cause unnecessary harm. The author might have wanted to protect the new boyfriend, but it's possible the new boyfriend would have found out eventually or not needed to know if the ex was honest.\n\nSo considering all angles, the author likely is in the wrong because they shared personal information without the ex's consent, which can be seen as meddling. Even though the ex cheated, the method of dealing with it by informing the new boyfriend is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
