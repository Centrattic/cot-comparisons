It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that their ex cheated on them, they found out, broke up, and then later told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. Now the ex and their friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's ex cheated, which is a serious betrayal. The author confronted her, the relationship ended, and then they felt compelled to inform the new boyfriend about the infidelity. The key point here is whether it's justified for the author to share that information with the new BF.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they were protecting the new BF from being cheated on as well. They might believe that if they were in the new BF's position, they'd want to know. But on the other hand, the author isn't the one who was directly wronged in the current relationship. The ex's new BF might not have a right to be told by someone who isn't part of their current relationship. The author could be seen as inserting themselves into someone else's relationship, maybe out of spite or to get revenge.\n\nAlso, the author's actions caused the new BF to break up with the ex. This could be seen as interfering, and possibly going too far. Even if the author's intent was good, the method might be problematic. It's important to consider boundaries here. The author might have a valid reason, but sharing private information about an ex-partner to a new partner can be seen as crossing a line, especially without the ex's consent.\n\nAnother angle: the author's ex and their friends are siding with her, believing her version of events. This suggests that the author's communication might not have been clear or that there's some bias in how the story is being told. However, that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of wrongdoing. If the information is true, the author might feel justified, but the way it was communicated is questionable.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions might be considered unethical. They might have had the right to feel hurt and to share their story, but doing so to a new partner could be seen as meddling. The new BF should ideally get that information from the ex directly, not through a third party. The author's action could be a form of emotional manipulation or revenge, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong. They violated privacy and interfered in another relationship, even if their intentions were to warn the new BF. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
