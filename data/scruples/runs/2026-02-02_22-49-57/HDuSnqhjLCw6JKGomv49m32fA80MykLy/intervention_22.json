I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up. Then, five months later, the ex starts dating someone new. The author contacts the new boyfriend via email to tell him about the cheating. The new boyfriend breaks up with her because of this, and now the ex and mutual friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants to know my take. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong).\n\nHmm. Ethically, this is a tricky area. The author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend by informing him about the ex's infidelity. But did they have the right to do that? The ex was already in a different relationship, so the author might not be in a position to meddle. However, the author might argue that they were being honest to prevent another person from getting hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions might have been her own business, and the author sharing that information could be seen as interfering. Even if the author's intention was good, contacting the new boyfriend without the ex's consent might be a breach of privacy. The ex's new partner has the right to know, but perhaps the author should have approached it differently, like not using an email but maybe talking to the ex directly first.\n\nBut the author's friends still believe the ex's side, which complicates things. The author might feel vindicated because their truth isn't being heard. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the action of contacting the new boyfriend. It's possible that the author overstepped, even with good intentions. The line between honesty and betrayal can be thin. So, even if the author's motive was to prevent the new guy from being hurt, the method might be problematic. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to contact ex-partners' new relationships because it can be seen as harmful and unnecessary. The author might have crossed that line, making them at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a bit nuanced. The key points are intention vs. action, privacy concerns, and the impact on others. The author's action led to the new relationship ending, which the ex might not have wanted. So, even if the author felt it was right, the action could be considered wrong.\n"
