I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person's ex cheated with a gym buddy. They found out through a friend, confronted her, ended the relationship. Now, five months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The person decides to email the new BF about the cheating, leading to the new BF breaking things off. The ex and others are upset, but the ex's friends believe her side.\n\nSo, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, sharing private information about an ex can be seen as crossing a boundary. Once a relationship ends, even if it's messy, revealing past infidelities might be considered interfering. The person might argue they were protecting the new BF from potential harm, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action if the ex had already moved on.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might feel justified because they believe the new BF has a right to know. If they would want the same information if roles were reversed, it's a matter of honesty. However, the method of disclosure is questionable. Directly contacting the new BF without the ex's consent could be seen as invasive and manipulative.\n\nAlso, the fact that the ex's friends turned against the person and believe the ex's version suggests a possible bias or conflict. But that doesn't make the person's action right. The key issue here is whether the information should be shared after the fact, especially after the relationship has ended and the ex has moved on. \n\nIn many cases, privacy and respecting boundaries are important post-breakup. Even if the ex cheated, sharing that with a new partner might not be the other person's business unless there's a direct impact. The person might not be legally wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. The action could be seen as revenge or an attempt to undermine the ex, which complicates the morality of it.\n\nConsidering these points, the person's action, while possibly well-intentioned, likely crosses ethical boundaries by intruding on the ex's new relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
