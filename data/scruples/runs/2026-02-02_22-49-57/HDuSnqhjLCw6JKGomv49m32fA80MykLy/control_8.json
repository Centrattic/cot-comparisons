I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated on them, and after a messy breakup, the ex ended up with new friends. Now the ex has a new boyfriend. The author found out through a friend and sent the new BF an email about the cheating. The new BF broke up with the ex because of this, and now the author is getting backlash from the ex and her friends.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they were wronged. They might think the new BF has a right to know. The author could argue that they were protecting the new BF from being cheated on again, so it's a form of honesty or even a good deed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't go through the ex to inform the BF. There's an invasion of privacy here. The author didn't have permission to share that information. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent could be seen as gossip or damaging someone's reputation. The author might be causing further harm and conflict, especially since the breakup was already messy. Also, the author is now creating more tension by making the ex and her friends turn against them, which could lead to more problems without resolving the initial hurt.\n\nAnother angle: The author's actions might be retaliating. The ex stole friends and lied, so maybe the author is trying to get back at her by spreading the truth. But even if the ex was a jerk, sharing private information about her could be crossing a line. It's possible that the ex cheating is a fact, but how the author chose to share it (without the ex's consent and directly to the new BF) is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's friends believed the ex's side. Maybe the author didn't handle the situation well initially, leading to others not trusting them. But that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong to act now. However, the method of communication is key here. Sending an email directly to the new BF might be seen as meddling beyond what's appropriate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes people feel the need to speak out to protect others. But in relationships, it's usually up to the person who was wronged to disclose such information, not a third party. The author might have valid reasons, but the way it was done could be considered meddling or unkind.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for sharing the information directly, even if the information itself is true. The method and intent could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the motivation was good. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
