I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The ex cheated during the three-year relationship, and the author found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex is dating someone new. The author emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result is the new boyfriend broke up with her because of the info, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe main question here is whether the author was wrong to contact the new boyfriend with that information. Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, the author might feel they were doing the right thing by informing the new BF to prevent him from being cheated on again. They mention they would want to know if their partner had cheated before. \n\nBut on the other hand, sharing such personal information without the ex's consent could be seen as invading privacy. Even though the author was hurt, taking matters into their own hands by contacting the new BF might be considered overstepping boundaries. It's possible that the new BF had the right to know, but the method of delivery\u2014emailing him directly\u2014could be problematic. The author wasn't in a position to act as a go-between for the ex and the new BF, and doing so might have caused more harm than good, especially since the ex's friends are now siding with her against the author.\n\nAlso, the author's actions might have been driven by resentment or a desire for revenge, especially since the ex stole friends and lied. But regardless of the motivation, the act of contacting the new BF without the ex's permission is still a breach of her privacy. Even if the intention was good, the method was invasive.\n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that the author was trying to protect someone else from being hurt. However, the right to privacy is generally considered important, and sharing someone's past actions, especially after a breakup, can be seen as unethical unless it's done through proper channels (like telling the new partner through the ex's own admission).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps motivated by good intentions, were likely inappropriate. They didn't have the authority to share that information, and it resulted in further conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
