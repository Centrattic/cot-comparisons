I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated, they broke up. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, and ended things. Then, after five months, the ex started a new relationship. The author, wanting to protect the new boyfriend (assuming the new guy would want to know about the cheating), sent an email to inform him. As a result, the new boyfriend broke things off, and the ex, along with the author's ex-friends, is now calling the author an asshole. The author believes they're not in the wrong.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is wrong. On one hand, intervening in someone else's relationship can be seen as overstepping. The author didn't have a right to disclose the ex's past unless it was directly relevant, but their intention was to prevent harm. However, the ex had already broken up with the author, so the author isn't part of the new relationship. The author's action could be seen as meddling, even if with good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is protecting the new boyfriend from potential betrayal by sharing information the new boyfriend might not get otherwise. There's a moral argument here about transparency. But legally and socially, there's a line about privacy and not interfering in others' relationships. Even if the author's intent was good, sharing someone else's past without their consent can be problematic.\n\nAlso, the ex's friends not believing the author's side might be due to the author's method of disclosure\u2014emailing the new boyfriend instead of approaching the situation differently. But the core issue is whether the author had the right to inform the new partner. \n\nIn many cases, people consider it wrong to spread information about an ex, especially after the relationship has ended, unless there's a direct threat. However, if the information is relevant to the new partner's decision to be with the ex, some might argue it's justified. But in this case, the author's action led to the breakup, which might have been avoidable if handled differently or not at all.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's action was a breach of privacy, even if well-intentioned. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
