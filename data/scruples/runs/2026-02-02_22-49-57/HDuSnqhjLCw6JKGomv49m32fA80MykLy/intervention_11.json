I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person in question is asking if they're at fault for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the infidelity. The key points here are the actions taken and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated, which the author discovered through a friend. They confronted her, she confessed, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the author found out the ex started dating someone new. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend explaining the cheating incident. The result was the new boyfriend breaking up with her, leading to the ex and her friends labeling the author as an asshole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a debate. Telling someone about a past partner's infidelity could be seen as a protective action, as the new partner might want to know about any potential red flags. However, the author didn't go through the ex to inform the new boyfriend, which might be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might have valid reasons, like wanting the new partner to know the truth, but sharing such personal information without consent can be invasive.\n\nLegally, there's little to be concerned about in terms of defamation if the information is true, but ethically, it's more nuanced. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in the ex's new relationship. Even if their intent was good, the method involved contacting someone directly with private information, which isn't typically considered appropriate.\n\nThe ex's reaction and her friends' support might be influenced by the fact that they don't know her cheating history. The author's disclosure might have caused unintended consequences, like the breakup of the new relationship, which can be seen as harsh regardless of the truth.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent might be to protect the new partner, the method used is questionable. It's a gray area, but generally, people are expected to let past partners handle their own disclosures in new relationships. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
