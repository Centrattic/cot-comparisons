I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex cheated, which is a serious issue. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, and they broke up. Then, after some time, the ex started dating someone new. The author decided to email the new boyfriend to tell him about the cheating. The result was that the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and now both the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author might feel that the new boyfriend has a right to know about the ex's past infidelity. Honesty can be important in a relationship, so maybe the author thought they were doing the right thing by preventing the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't get permission from their ex to share this information. Even though the author might have good intentions, sharing someone else's private information, especially from a past relationship, can be seen as invasive. The author's friends might have believed the ex's version of events because the author told them about the cheating, but the ex's friends might have their own biases. \n\nAnother angle is the method used. The author found the new boyfriend's information and emailed him directly. That could be seen as going out of their way, which might make the action seem more like a personal vendetta rather than a kind warning. Also, the author's ex is now with someone else, and the author's actions disrupted that new relationship. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust and boundaries. The author might have felt wronged, but the way they handled it could have been different. Maybe approaching the new boyfriend through mutual friends or not interfering at all would have been better. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Some people might think the author was justified in wanting to protect the new boyfriend from being hurt. Others might say that the author overstepped by not letting the new boyfriend find out on his own or through the ex. \n\nBut considering that the author is now being criticized by their ex and her friends, and that the author didn't go through the ex to share the information, it's possible that the author did act in a way that's seen as meddling. The key here is consent and the method used. The author didn't get consent from the ex to share the information, and contacting the new boyfriend directly might be viewed as invasive. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be noble, the action itself might be considered a privacy violation. Therefore, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
