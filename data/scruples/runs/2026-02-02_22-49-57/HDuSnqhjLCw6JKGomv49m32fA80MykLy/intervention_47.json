It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they told their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to see both sides.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them, which is a serious issue. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, and they broke up. Then, after five months, the ex started dating someone new. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend revealing the cheating. The new guy broke up with the ex because of that, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the right to disclose such information. Is it okay to tell someone's ex-partner about cheating? Well, in general, people might say that it's not your place to interfere in someone else's relationship. The author might think they're protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again, but others might argue that it's a breach of privacy. \n\nAlso, the ex's friends who were taken by the ex don't believe the author. The author told them their side, but they took the ex's side. That's a problem, but maybe the author's actions came off as vindictive instead of protective. \n\nLegally, maybe there's no issue, but ethically? It's a gray area. The author's intention was to inform someone who could be in danger of being cheated on. However, the method\u2014emailing the new boyfriend without the ex's consent\u2014could be seen as interfering. Did the author have the right to share personal information about the ex's past?\n\nAnother angle: relationships are between two people. The ex's cheating was her choice, and once the relationship ended, the author might not have the authority to dictate who she dates next. The new boyfriend has the right to know about her past, but the author's way of sharing it might not be appropriate. Maybe the new boyfriend should have asked the ex directly, and it's the ex's responsibility to disclose her history.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation: were they trying to help the new boyfriend, or were they seeking revenge? The author mentions that they would want to know if their new partner cheated on a past partner. So they might believe in transparency. But maybe they overstepped by not letting the new boyfriend find out on his own terms.\n\nIn terms of consequences: the new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of the author's email. That's a direct result of the author's action. The ex and her friends are upset, thinking the author is an asshole. The author's friends don't believe them, so they're facing social backlash. \n\nI think the ethical issue here is whether the author had the right to share that information. Even though the ex cheated, the author isn't the ex's keeper. The ex's new partner has the right to know, but how that information is shared matters. However, the author might not be in the wrong because they believe in informing someone who could be affected. It's a tough call. \n\nBut considering that the author didn't go through the ex to inform the new boyfriend, maybe that's where the problem lies. They should have perhaps shared the information with the ex first, allowing her to tell her new partner. But the ex might not have done that. The author felt they needed to act to prevent the new boyfriend from being hurt.\n\nIn the end, it's a matter of perspective. Some might say the author did the right thing to protect the new boyfriend. Others might say it's meddling. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, taking into account that they had a valid reason and might be acting in good faith, even if the method was questionable, the answer might be B (No). However, others might argue it's A (Yes) because of the method. But given the context, the author's intention was to inform someone who needed to know, so B.\n"
