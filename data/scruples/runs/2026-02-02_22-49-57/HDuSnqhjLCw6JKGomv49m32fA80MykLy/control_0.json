I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the person's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, the person found out, ended the relationship, and then later told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The ex and their friends are now upset, calling the person an asshole.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethics here. Did the person have a right to tell the new boyfriend? Well, the person's reasoning was that they would want to know if their new girlfriend had cheated. But is revealing someone's past infidelity without their consent ethical? \n\nThe ex and the person are no longer in a relationship. The person isn't in a position to control the ex's new relationships. Maybe by telling the new boyfriend, the person is overstepping. Even if the person's intention was to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on, they didn't have the ex's permission to share that information. It's an invasion of privacy, even though the information is true.\n\nAlso, the person's actions led to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex. That's a direct consequence. While the ex did cheat, the person's method of confronting the new boyfriend might be considered interfering in someone else's relationship. The ex's new boyfriend might have his own reasons for staying with her, and the person's action disrupted that. \n\nAnother angle: the ex and the person's friends took the ex's side. The person might feel vindicated that the new boyfriend broke up with her, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Sharing personal information, even if true, can be a breach of trust once the relationship is over. \n\nOn the other hand, the person could argue self-defense, wanting to protect others from the same betrayal. But legally and ethically, that's a gray area. There's no legal protection for someone to share such information unless there's a specific reason, like ongoing harm. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person might be in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, which could be seen as meddling in someone else's affairs. Even though the ex cheated, the method of addressing it was not appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
