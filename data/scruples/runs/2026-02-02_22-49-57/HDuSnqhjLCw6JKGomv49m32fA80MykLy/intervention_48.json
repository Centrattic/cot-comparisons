I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person (AITA) is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. The ex cheated during their 3-year relationship, found out by a friend, they broke up, and now the ex has a new BF. The AITA sent an email to the new BF explaining the cheating, and now the BF broke up with her. The ex and her friends are calling AITA an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is whether it's right to inform someone their partner is cheating, even if you're not the current partner. The AITA's reasoning is that if they were in the new BF's position, they would want to know. That's a common argument for doing something like this. However, there's also the aspect of privacy and boundaries. The ex is now in a new relationship, and AITA didn't go through the ex to inform the BF. Instead, they reached out directly, which might be seen as interfering.\n\nBut wait, the ex was the one who cheated, and the AITA isn't the current partner. So, does the AITA have the right to share that information? Some people might say that if you're not in the current relationship, it's not your place to interfere. Others might say that if you know about infidelity, it's important to prevent the new partner from being hurt, even if you're not the one in the current relationship. \n\nAlso, there's the part where the breakup wasn't pretty. The ex lied to friends and stole them. The AITA's friends now support the ex, so maybe the AITA's side of the story isn't being heard. This might add to the complexity, but the main question is about the action of telling the new BF. \n\nAnother angle is the method. The AITA didn't confront the ex again or try to mediate; they went straight to the new BF. Depending on the context, this could be seen as vindictive or protective. If the AITA's intention was to warn the new BF, maybe it's justified. But if the intention was to get back at the ex, then it's more about revenge. The AITA's reasoning seems to be about the new BF's right to know, which is a point in their favor. \n\nHowever, there's also the legal and social aspect. In some places, spreading private information about someone else, even if true, could have legal implications, but that's more about defamation. Since the AITA is telling the truth, maybe that's a defense. But social norms might still judge them for breaching privacy. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The AITA is sharing true information that they believe the new BF has a right to know. The ex's actions were wrong, and the AITA is trying to prevent the new BF from being deceived. However, the method of sharing that information directly with the BF without going through the ex could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The AITA's intention was to protect the new BF, which is a good motive. The ex's actions were the initial wrong. So maybe the AITA isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that the AITA is meddling in a new relationship where they have no place. \n\nConsidering common AITA threads, people often consider the intent and the context. If the AITA's intent was to inform, not to harm, and the information is true, then they might not be in the wrong. However, the method could be questioned. But overall, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
