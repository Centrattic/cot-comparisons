I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on the author with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, and they broke up. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the author told this new boyfriend about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex. Now, the author is getting backlash from the ex and her friends who think the author is an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author felt that the new boyfriend should know about the ex's infidelity. The reasoning is that the author would want to know if their new partner cheated on a past relationship. But on the other hand, intervening in someone else's relationship can be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might be overstepping by sharing private information about the ex, even if it's true.\n\nLegally, there might not be an issue because the information is truthful, but ethically, it's more gray. The author is inserting themselves into a new relationship, which could be seen as meddling. The fact that the ex and her friends don't believe the author's side suggests there might be some bias or ongoing conflict. \n\nAlso, the method of sharing the information\u2014via email\u2014without the ex's consent might be problematic. Even if the intention was good, the action could be seen as violating privacy. The author might not have considered the consequences of their actions on the new relationship, even if they felt justified.\n\nIn some perspectives, people might argue that the author had a valid reason to want the truth to come out, especially since the ex had lied before. But others might see it as revenge or an attempt to harm the ex's new relationship. The key points here are intent, the method used, and the impact on others. \n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a judgment call. However, since the action involved sharing private information without the ex's consent and directly affecting a new relationship, the author is likely overstepping. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
