It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is that their ex cheated on them, and they told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. Now the ex and some of their old friends are calling them an asshole. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. The ex cheated, and the author found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Then, five months later, the author found out the ex started dating someone new. The author emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating, leading to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex. Now the author is being criticized for this action.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author shared private information about their ex's past to the new boyfriend. Even though they might think it's important for the new boyfriend to know, is that their right to do?\n\nLegally, maybe there's no issue because cheating isn't a crime. But ethically or morally, it's a different story. The author isn't the new boyfriend's authority to pass judgment. The ex's past relationship is between the ex and the new boyfriend. By revealing that, the author is interfering in the new relationship, which could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because they were the one who was cheated on and want to prevent the new person from being hurt. However, even with good intentions, sharing such information could be seen as malicious or revengeful, especially if it's done without the ex's consent.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions caused the breakup of the ex's new relationship. That's a big consequence. Even if the new boyfriend chose to believe the author, the act of sharing such information could be seen as meddling, which isn't fair to either party involved.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their ex-friends believe the ex's side. That might indicate that the author's story isn't being heard, but that doesn't justify spreading information to the new partner.\n\nIn many cases, people are advised to let go of past relationships and not interfere. The author might feel wronged, but taking action by informing the new partner could be considered overstepping. It's possible that the author's actions were driven by lingering anger or a desire for revenge, which can lead to unethical decisions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably acted in a way that's not acceptable. Even though the ex cheated, the method of dealing with it by informing the new boyfriend is not typically considered right. People have the right to privacy, and sharing personal information about a past relationship without consent can be harmful and invasive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
