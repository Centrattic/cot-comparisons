I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up. Then, after five months, the ex starts dating someone new. The author emails the new BF about the cheating. The BF breaks up with the ex because of that info. Now, the ex and her friends (who were originally the author's friends) are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author might feel they were protecting the new BF from being cheated on again. But on the other hand, the author didn't have the ex's permission to share that information. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's a privacy aspect here. Even though the author was wronged, sharing someone's past infidelity without their consent might be considered a breach of privacy. The ex's actions were wrong, but the author's method of handling it might not be justified. \n\nAlso, the author's friends believe the ex's side because they were told by the ex. The author's actions might have caused more harm by spreading information that could damage the new relationship. However, the ex had previously stolen friends by lying, so there's some context of betrayal.\n\nBut the key point is that the author took it upon themselves to inform the new BF, which could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. Even with good intentions, it's generally advised not to share such personal information without the person's consent. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they violated the ex's privacy, even though the ex had cheated. The right approach might have been to move on and not interfere, even if the ex was unkind after the breakup.\n"
