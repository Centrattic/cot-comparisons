I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is pretty clear: the author's ex cheated, they found out through a friend, confronted her, broke up, and then later told the new boyfriend about the cheating. Now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main question is whether it's right to inform someone else about a past partner's infidelity. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner had cheated before, so they did the same for the new guy. But does that justify sharing that information?\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. They think transparency is important. However, on the other hand, the author is revealing personal information about their ex without her consent. Even though the ex was cheating, the author might have crossed a line by disclosing that information to someone else. \n\nLegal aspects might not be the main focus here, but ethically, there's a question of privacy. The author could be seen as violating their ex's privacy by sharing her past actions. Also, the way they did it\u2014without the ex's permission\u2014could be problematic. Even if the author's intentions were good, the act of sharing such information might be considered meddling or revenge.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of the information, which might have been a valid reason for him. But the author is now facing backlash from the ex and her friends, who don't believe the author's side. The author's friends also seem to take the ex's side, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to share the information? Was it their place to protect the new boyfriend by informing him? Or did they overstep by interfering in the ex's new relationship?\n\nSome people might argue that the author did the right thing by being honest, as the new boyfriend has a right to know. Others might say that the author should have kept it to themselves or gone through the ex first. The fact that the author didn't confront the ex about sharing this information but did it directly to the new boyfriend might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the ex was at fault.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the ex cheated, so she's the one in the wrong in the original situation. The author's action is a reaction to that. However, the author's method of addressing their hurt might not be the right approach. Revenge or taking matters into their own hands could be seen as wrong, regardless of the ex's actions.\n\nSo, weighing all that, the author probably is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intent was to inform the new boyfriend. The ethical issue here is about respecting others' privacy and not taking justice into one's own hands.\n"
