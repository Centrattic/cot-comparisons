I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, and they broke up. Then the author emailed the new boyfriend to tell him about the cheating, which led to the new guy breaking up with her. Now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author had a valid reason\u2014they wanted the new boyfriend to know about the cheating because they believe it's important information. But did they have the right to share that information? The ex's privacy is a factor. Even though the ex cheated, the author is now revealing that information to a third party, which could be seen as violating privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation: they might be acting out of spite or trying to get back at the ex for stealing their friends. If the author's actions were driven by revenge rather than concern for the new boyfriend's well-being, that could make it worse. On the other hand, if the intention was to prevent the new boyfriend from being cheated on again, that's a different angle. \n\nAnother point is whether the author had a duty to keep the information private after the breakup. Once the relationship is over, does the author have the right to share past events? It's possible that by sharing this, the author is interfering in the new relationship, which might not be fair. \n\nThe consequences: the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, so the author's action affected their relationship. But if the information was true, maybe the new boyfriend should have known. However, the method of disclosure\u2014emailing directly without giving the ex a chance to explain\u2014might have been confrontational. The ex might have had her own side of the story that wasn't shared, so the new boyfriend only heard one perspective.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their ex-friends believe the ex's version. That suggests there might be a bias or lack of communication from the author's side. The author's actions might have been seen as spreading gossip, even if it's true. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the author had a reason, but sharing private information without the other person's consent, especially after a breakup, can be seen as crossing a line. It's possible the author acted out of spite and caused harm to the ex's new relationship, which is wrong regardless of the original cheating. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, some might argue it's justified to protect the new boyfriend. But generally, sharing someone's private information without consent is considered wrong.\n"
