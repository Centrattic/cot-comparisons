      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was in a 3-year relationship, the ex cheated with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up. The ex lied to friends and stole them. Now, 5 months later, the author hears the ex started dating someone new. The author emails the new boyfriend about the cheating, which leads to the ex and her friends calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the ex cheated, which is a serious issue. The author might feel that the new boyfriend has a right to know. But on the other hand, the author had a prior agreement to keep the breakup details private? Wait, no, there's no mention of an agreement. But usually, after a breakup, people are expected to move on and not interfere. \n\nThe author's action could be seen as interfering in the new relationship. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, using a friend to overhear might not be the best approach. Also, the author sent the email directly without going through the ex, which might have been a more appropriate step. However, the ex already knew about her own cheating, so maybe the author felt it was necessary to inform the new partner.\n\nBut is it the author's place to do that? There's a boundary here. Even if the ex did wrong, sharing that information with her new partner without her consent could be a breach of privacy. The author might not have the right to disclose that information, even if it's true. It's possible that the ex's new partner should have asked the ex directly about her past. \n\nThe outcome is that the new boyfriend broke up with her, which might have been because of the email. The ex and her friends (who were originally the author's friends but now take her side) are upset. The author didn't tell the new boyfriend through proper channels, which could be why people are seeing it as wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. Legally, maybe not wrong, but socially and ethically, it's questionable. The author might have acted out of a desire to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again, but the method was intrusive. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they interfered in a new relationship without the ex's consent, even if the information was true. So, choice A.\n"
