I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they did the right thing by telling their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated on them. \n\nFirst, the context: The ex cheated with a gym buddy, the user found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up. Then, months later, the ex starts dating someone new. The user found the new BF's info and emailed him about the cheating. The BF broke up with the ex because of this. Now, the user is getting called an asshole by the ex and her friends, who don't know the truth.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, revenge or taking matters into their own hands isn't usually considered right. The user didn't go through any official channels or involve authorities. Instead, they went directly to the new BF with personal information. That could be seen as invasion of privacy or interfering in another relationship. \n\nHowever, the user's intention was to protect the new BF from being cheated on again. They believed they were doing the right thing by informing him. But the method might be questionable. Instead of confronting the new BF, maybe they could have approached law enforcement if there were legal aspects, or left it to the ex to disclose her past. But since the user isn't the one who committed the crime, maybe they felt a moral duty to warn the new boyfriend.\n\nBut legally and ethically, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be problematic. Even if the user's intent was good, the action might have crossed a line. The ex cheated, but the user's response could be seen as spreading gossip or taking justice into their own hands. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to reveal someone's past secrets unless it's directly affecting you. Here, the user's action affected the new relationship, which might not have been their place. So, while understandable, the action might be considered wrong.\n"
