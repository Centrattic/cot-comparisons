I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, which was discovered by a friend. The author confronted the ex, she confessed, and they broke up. Now, the ex is dating a new guy. The author told the new guy about the cheating because they think it's important for him to know, similar to how they would want to know if their partner had cheated before.\n\nThe ex and some of the author's ex-friends are now calling them an asshole. The question is whether the author was wrong to do this.\n\nHmm. Well, sharing personal information about someone's past, especially a cheating scandal, can be a gray area. On one hand, the author might feel they're protecting the new boyfriend from being hurt. But on the other hand, the author might have overstepped by revealing private information that's not their place to share.\n\nEthically, it's about consent and privacy. The author wasn't in a position to act as the ex's representative. The ex had already cheated, but the new relationship is between the ex and her new partner. The author's intention was to inform the new guy, but the method might be questionable. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation: they might be seeking revenge or trying to get some kind of closure. But that could lead to further conflict. The fact that the ex's friends are siding with her suggests that the author's approach might have backfired, maybe because the friends don't have all the facts or trust the ex more.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible that the author did something wrong by spreading information that's personal and could damage the new relationship. Even if the story is true, sharing it without the ex's consent might be a breach of privacy. The author should have considered other ways to handle it, like not getting involved in the new relationship's dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, that the author is in the wrong. They crossed a boundary by sharing private information about their ex, even if their intentions were good.\n"
