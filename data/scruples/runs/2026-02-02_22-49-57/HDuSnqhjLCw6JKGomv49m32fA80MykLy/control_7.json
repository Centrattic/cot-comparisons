It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user's ex cheated on them, they found out, ended the relationship. Now the ex is with a new guy, and the user told him about the cheating. The new guy broke up with her because of that info. Now the ex and her friends are calling the user an asshole.\n\nThe user sent an email to the new BF, saying they would want to know if their GF cheated. The ex's friends don't believe the user's side. \n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the possible angles. \n\nOn one hand, the user was wronged by the ex. The cheating was a betrayal. The user might feel that the new BF deserves to know the truth to avoid repeating the same mistake. The user's action could be seen as an act of honesty or even self-defense to prevent the new BF from getting hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing such information could be considered an invasion of privacy or spreading gossip. The user might have crossed a boundary by contacting the ex's new partner directly. Even though the user had a valid reason (the ex cheated), the method of sharing that information wasn't through the ex but directly to her new BF. This could be seen as meddling or causing harm intentionally.\n\nLegal and social norms: In many places, there's no law against sharing such information if it's truthful, but socially, it's often frowned upon. People might say that the user should have confronted the ex, not the new BF. Also, the user's ex's friends not believing their side complicates things, showing that the user's credibility is in question.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The user had a legitimate grievance, but the way they handled it might have been inappropriate. The key factors are intent (to warn the new BF) vs. the method (direct confrontation without the ex's knowledge). Some might argue that the user was justified in protecting the new BF, but others would say it's not their place to interfere.\n\nIn similar situations, people often advise against interfering in an ex's new relationship, as it can lead to more harm than good. The user's actions led to the breakup of the ex's new relationship, which could be seen as a negative consequence. However, the user's intention was to prevent the new BF from being hurt, which is a noble intent.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer could go either way. But in terms of social norms and typical advice given in such scenarios, the user might be considered in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries and for causing direct harm to the ex's new relationship. So probably answer A.\n"
