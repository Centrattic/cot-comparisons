I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated on them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The ex cheated, the author found out, and after a breakup, the ex is now with a new partner. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend revealing the infidelity. The new boyfriend ended the relationship because of this, and now the ex and mutual friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe core question is about the morality and ethics of the author's actions. Legally, maybe not, but ethically? Well, the ex did cheat. The author is sharing a personal experience. But did they have the right to contact the new boyfriend and inform him about past events? \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they believe the new boyfriend deserves to know. They might think it's a red flag if the new girlfriend cheated before. However, on the other hand, the author is invading the privacy of the ex by sharing personal information with her new partner. Also, the author might have acted out of spite or revenge, especially considering the messy breakup and losing friends.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't go through the ex to share this information. The new boyfriend wasn't involved in the past relationship, so maybe it's not his place to be informed directly by someone who isn't part of the current relationship. The author could have chosen to keep it to themselves or talk to their mutual friends, but instead, they went straight to the new boyfriend. \n\nAlso, the author's ex-friends believe the ex's side of the story. That suggests there might be some manipulation or differing perspectives on the breakup. The author's actions might have been driven by a desire for validation or revenge, which complicates the situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. However, intervening in someone else's relationship by sharing past transgressions without their consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the act was real, the method of disclosure might be inappropriate. The author's action might not be illegal, but ethically, they might be at fault for interfering in the new relationship without a legitimate reason, such as a legal obligation or a direct threat.\n"
