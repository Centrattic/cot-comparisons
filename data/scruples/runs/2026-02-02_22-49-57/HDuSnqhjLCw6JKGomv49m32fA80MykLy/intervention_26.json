I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, which they found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Then, five months later, the author heard the ex started dating someone new. They found the new boyfriend's info and sent him an email revealing the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex and told her about the email. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole, likely because they don't know the full story and take her side.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Telling the new BF about the cheating could be seen as interfering in her new relationship. Even if the author's intention was to inform the new partner, it might be considered overstepping boundaries. The ex had already ended the relationship, so the author might not have a right to meddle after the breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because they believe the new BF should know about the cheating. They might think it's important for the new partner to be aware of the ex's past behavior. But does that justify contacting the new BF directly? Usually, people are advised to not contact ex-partners after a breakup, especially in a contentious one. The method of finding the new BF's info and sending an email could be seen as invasive and not a private matter.\n\nAlso, the fact that the ex lied to the author's friends and took them, leading to the author being labeled an asshole, suggests that there's a history of conflict. The ex's side might be more believable to others if she's already manipulating the narrative before. But again, the act of contacting the new BF directly is problematic regardless of the validity of the author's information.\n\nThere's a line between sharing information and spreading gossip. The author's email could be viewed as sharing personal, potentially damaging information without the ex's consent. Even if true, doing so after the breakup might be considered a breach of privacy or a way to exert control, which is not healthy.\n\nSo, considering intent, method, and consequences, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they took it upon themselves to inform the new BF, leading to further conflict and damage. The right approach would have been to move on and not interfere, even if they had the information. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
