I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. So, the situation is that the author's ex cheated on them, they ended the relationship, and then the author told the new boyfriend about the infidelity. The ex and some friends are now calling the author an asshole. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author was wronged by the ex, and maybe they felt the new boyfriend deserved to know. On the other hand, the author might have crossed a boundary by sharing personal information without the ex's consent. \n\nThe key points here: the author found out through a third party, confronted the ex, ended the relationship, and then later told the new boyfriend. The ex is now with someone else, and the author took it upon themselves to inform the new partner. \n\nLegally, there might not be much to do, but ethically, it's a gray area. Spreading someone's private information, even if it's true, can have consequences. The author might have acted out of a sense of justice or to prevent the new boyfriend from being cheated on, but they didn't go through proper channels. Maybe confronting the ex again or seeking legal advice would have been better steps. \n\nAlso, the author's actions led to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex. The ex and friends are upset because they feel the author violated privacy. Even if the author's intention was good, the method might be questionable. \n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that their ex-friends don't know the whole story and believe the ex's side. Maybe the author felt like they needed to protect their reputation or set the record straight, but doing so directly to the new partner might have been the wrong approach. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, people usually have a right to privacy, even if they're exes. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of their feelings being valid, but the action of contacting the new boyfriend without a clear reason (like legal action or a direct threat) might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the new boyfriend has a right to know if his partner has a history of infidelity. The author might think they're doing the right thing by preventing future harm. But the method of communication is one-sided and without the ex's input. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. If the community values privacy and personal boundaries more, then the author is in the wrong (A). If they prioritize honesty and protecting new partners from potential deceit, then the author isn't wrong (B). \n\nI think the action was a breach of privacy, even if the intent was good. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
