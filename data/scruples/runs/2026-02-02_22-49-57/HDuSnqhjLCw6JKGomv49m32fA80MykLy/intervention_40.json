I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's ex cheated on them during the relationship. They found out through a friend, confronted her, and broke up. Then, when the ex started dating a new guy, the author emailed him about the cheating. The new guy broke up with her because of this, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole. The author's friends don't believe their side.\n\nSo, the main question is whether telling the new boyfriend was the right thing to do. On one hand, the author might feel that the new guy has a right to know about the ex's past behavior. On the other hand, the author might be overstepping by sharing personal information without the ex's consent. \n\nEthically, there's a debate here. Some might say that the author is protecting the new boyfriend from being hurt, while others might say it's interfering and could be considered revenge. Also, the fact that the author's own friends don't believe them adds to the complexity. \n\nLegally, in many places, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be problematic, especially if it's done with malicious intent. The author might have crossed a line by contacting the new boyfriend directly. Even if the cheating is true, the method of disclosure could be seen as unethical or invasive.\n\nAdditionally, the author's motivation is important. If it was to warn the new boyfriend, maybe it's justified. But if it was to get back at the ex, it's more of a vindictive act. The story mentions that the author would want to know about their partner's past, so maybe they thought it was fair. However, acting on that belief without considering the consequences could be the issue.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many people would consider it inappropriate to contact an ex's new partner about past issues unless there's a legitimate reason and proper channels. The author might have handled it better by not getting involved once the relationship was over.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information without consent and potentially acted out of revenge, even if their intention was to protect the new boyfriend. The method and context matter here.\n"
