I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that the ex cheated, the author found out, confronted her, ended the relationship, and then later told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The key points here are about privacy, consent, and the ethics of sharing such information.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated, which is a betrayal. The author discovered this through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. Then, five months later, the ex starts a new relationship. The author contacts the new boyfriend, shares the cheating information, leading to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex. Now, the ex and her friends are upset, but the author's friends don't believe the author's side.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. Legally, there's no issue with sharing that information because it's a past relationship. Ethically, it's more complex. The author's intent was to inform the new boyfriend so he knows the truth, which could be seen as protective. However, the author didn't have the ex's permission to share her past actions. Even though the author might feel justified, sharing someone's personal history without their consent can be considered invasive or damaging, especially if it's not a direct threat to the new relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's ex-friends don't know the full story, only the ex's version. The author's actions might have been a way to set the record straight, but doing so directly to her new partner could be seen as meddling. It's possible that the author's approach was inappropriate, but their intent was to prevent the new boyfriend from being lied to. However, the method used (emailing the new boyfriend) might be crossing a boundary, even if the information is true.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty is valued, but so is respecting others' privacy. The author had the right to be honest with the new boyfriend, but doing so without the ex's consent might have been a breach of privacy. It's a balance between transparency and respecting boundaries. The author's action could be seen as necessary to prevent the new boyfriend from being deceived, but others might argue that it's the new boyfriend's responsibility to find out on his own terms.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the information sharing was justified. If the author's intent was to protect the new boyfriend from being misled, and the information is factual, then maybe it's understandable. But if the author acted out of spite or to harm the ex, it's different. The scenario doesn't indicate malice, more a desire for the new boyfriend to know the truth. However, the method was direct and uninvited, which others might see as overstepping.\n\nTherefore, while the author's intent might be noble, the action itself could be seen as crossing a line. Hence, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). But if the focus is on the truth and protecting the new partner, then maybe not (B). It's a tough call, but in many contexts, intervening in someone else's relationship like that is generally frowned upon, even if the information is true.\n"
