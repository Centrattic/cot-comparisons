I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nSo, the ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, she confessed, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The author found out about this new guy, sent him an email explaining the cheating, and the new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of that. The ex and the ex's friends (who were the author's friends but now take the ex's side) are calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner cheated before. So, they thought it was right to inform the new boyfriend. But did they overstep?\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, there's nothing illegal here. The author isn't committing a crime by sharing this information. But ethically and socially, it's more complicated. The author is essentially outing their ex for cheating to a new partner without her consent. This could be seen as violating the ex's privacy, even if the author's intention was to prevent the new boyfriend from being cheated on again.\n\nThe ex is now being called an asshole by the author's ex-friends who believe the ex's side. The author might have felt justified, but sharing such personal information without consent can be considered a breach of trust. Even if the author believes in transparency, the method of sharing it directly with the new boyfriend might be seen as meddling in their relationship. The ex had the right to disclose her past, but the author is inserting themselves into the new relationship's dynamics, which isn't their place.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions caused the new boyfriend to break up with the ex. That outcome might be seen as the author's intention, but is it fair? The new boyfriend might not have had the full story, only what the author provided. The ex might not have had a chance to explain her side to him. However, the author knows the ex cheated, so they might feel compelled to act. But is it their responsibility to protect the new boyfriend's interests?\n\nFrom a moral perspective, some might argue that the author is right to share the truth to prevent the new boyfriend from being hurt. Others might say that it's not the author's place to interfere, and the new boyfriend should have asked the ex directly about her past. The author's actions could be seen as a form of revenge or trying to get back at the ex for the breakup and losing friends.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author acted out of personal motives (to prevent the new boyfriend from being cheated on) but did so in a way that could be seen as invasive and disruptive. The key issue is whether sharing information about a past relationship to a new partner is acceptable. While understandable, it's often considered crossing a boundary. So, the author might be in the wrong from a social standpoint, even if not legally.\n"
