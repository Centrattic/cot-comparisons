I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex telling their new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author and their ex were together for three years, with the last year involving infidelity. The author found out through a friend's eavesdropping, confronted the ex, who admitted it, leading to a breakup. The ex then stole friends. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the author contacted that person via email to inform them about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and now the ex and the author's ex-friends are calling them an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Legally, there's no law against sharing information about a past partner's infidelity, but ethically and socially, it's more complex. The author's intention was to share the truth, believing the new partner should know. But did they overstep by contacting the new boyfriend directly?\n\nIn many cases, people consider it a breach of privacy to contact someone's ex-partner's new partner. Even if the information is true, the method of sharing it might be problematic. The author didn't go through the ex directly or mediate through mutual friends. They took it upon themselves to reach out, which could be seen as interfering or vindictive, despite the truth.\n\nAlso, the ex's response was to take friends away, and now the author is criticized for sharing the information. The community might see the author as justified in wanting to protect the new boyfriend from repeat harm, but others might argue it's meddling in another relationship. The line between acting as a concerned person and being a \"do-gooder\" can be blurry. \n\nThe ex's friends not believing the author complicates it further, suggesting the ex's narrative is being spread more. But does that justify the author's actions? Maybe not, because spreading information without consent can have consequences, even if well-intentioned.\n\nSo, considering all angles, even if the author's intent was good, the act of contacting the new partner directly without consent could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might be A (wrong), but there's a strong case for B (not wrong) based on the motive. However, in many societal norms, contacting someone's new partner to share such information is frowned upon, regardless of intent. So leaning towards A.\n"
