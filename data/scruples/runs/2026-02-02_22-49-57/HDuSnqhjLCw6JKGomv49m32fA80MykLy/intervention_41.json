I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, the situation: The writer was cheated on by their ex. They found out through a friend, confronted the ex, who then confessed, leading to a breakup. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the writer sent an email to the new boyfriend revealing the infidelity. The result was the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex, and the writer is getting backlash from the ex and mutual friends.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the writer had a right to disclose that information. On one hand, they might feel it's important for the new boyfriend to know, given that they would want to know if their partner had cheated. On the other hand, the writer isn't the ex's parent or in a position to dictate her relationships. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, even though the ex cheated, the writer's action was to inform the new boyfriend without the ex's consent. That could be seen as interfering in the new relationship and potentially damaging someone else's life. But the writer's intention might have been to prevent the new boyfriend from being deceived. However, the method of disclosure might be problematic. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally, it's a gray area. The writer had a valid reason, but the act of contacting the new boyfriend directly could be considered overstepping boundaries. The ex's actions were wrong, but the writer's response might not be justified. Also, considering the aftermath\u2014friends siding with the ex and not knowing the truth\u2014shows the complexity of the situation. \n\nSo, while the ex cheated, the writer's action of informing the new boyfriend without their ex's permission might be seen as wrong. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because it's meddling in another person's relationship, even with good intentions.\n"
