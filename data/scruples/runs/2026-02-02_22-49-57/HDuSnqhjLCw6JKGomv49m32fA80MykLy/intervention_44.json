I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating incident. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated on the author with a gym buddy, which was discovered through a friend. The author confronted the ex, they broke up, and now the ex is dating someone new. The author, thinking it's important for the new boyfriend to know about the cheating, emailed him. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex after learning this. Now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the assistant's opinion.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about privacy and the right to share past infidelities with a new partner. The author's motivation was to inform the new BF about the ex's past behavior, which the author believes is relevant. However, the ex's side is claiming the author is wrong for interfering.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped by sharing personal information without consent. Even if the author's intention was good (to protect the new BF), sharing such details without the ex's permission might be seen as breaching trust or privacy. The author might have thought it's their right to inform the new BF since they were directly affected, but others might argue that the author should have let the new BF find out through the ex instead.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The ex lost friends who believed her side, but the author's actions led to the new BF breaking up with her. This could be seen as harsh, especially if the author's friends sided with the ex despite the author's evidence. However, the author's actions were a response to being cheated on and feeling that the new BF deserved to know.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. Legally, there's no issue, but ethically, it's debatable. Some might say the author has the right to share their experience, while others might say it's meddling in someone else's relationship. The key points are consent and the potential harm caused. The author acted out of a sense of responsibility but might have done so without considering the consequences on their ex's new relationship. \n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the answer might depend on cultural or social norms. If the community values transparency in relationships, the author might be justified. However, if privacy and boundaries are emphasized, the author could be seen as overstepping. Given that the user's friends are on the ex's side, it's possible that the author is perceived as the asshole here. But the user thinks otherwise. The final answer would need to weigh these factors.\n"
