I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. The ex cheated on them, they found out through a friend, confronted her, and the relationship ended. Then, after five months, the ex starts dating someone new. The author sends an email to the new BF telling him about the cheating. The BF breaks up with the ex because of this info. Now, the ex and some friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did the right thing by disclosing the cheating. On one hand, the author might feel that the new BF has a right to know about the ex's past infidelity. On the other hand, sharing that information could be seen as interfering or violating privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, honesty is important, so the author might think it's fair to inform the BF. However, the author isn't the BF's friend or family member, so maybe they overstepped by sharing personal information without being asked. Also, the ex and her new friends are upset, implying that the author's actions caused harm or disruption. \n\nThere's a question of boundaries here. Once a relationship is over, do you have the right to share past issues with the ex's new partner? It's possible that the author intended to protect the BF from a repeat of the past, but acting as a third party to expose someone's past could be seen as meddling. \n\nLegally, in many places, there's no law against this kind of disclosure unless it's part of harassment or defamation. But socially, it's more of a gray area. The author's friends took sides against them, suggesting that the community might view the action as crossing a line. \n\nThe key points are: did the author act out of concern for the BF's well-being, or was it vindictive? The author claims they would want to know if their partner had cheated, which adds a personal touch. However, the action might be seen as taking justice into their own hands rather than letting the BF discover the truth on his own or through other means.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might be to prevent the BF from being harmed, the method of disclosure without being directly involved in the BF's life could be considered overstepping. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
