I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The ex cheated, and the author found out through a friend. The breakup wasn't pretty, and the ex took the author's friends. Now the ex is dating someone new, and the author contacted him directly with the information about the cheating.\n\nIs it right to inform the new partner about past infidelity? On one hand, the author might think they're protecting the new guy from being cheated on again. But on the other hand, the author isn't in a position to judge or intervene in the new relationship. By revealing that information, the author could be seen as interfering, which might be considered a breach of privacy or boundaries. \n\nAlso, the ex's side of the story might be different. The author's friends believe the ex, which suggests there might be some social dynamics at play where the ex has spun the narrative. However, the author's intent was to share information they believed was important for the new BF to know. \n\nBut legally and ethically, sharing someone's private information without their consent, even if it's about cheating, can be problematic. The author might be overstepping by not letting the new BF find out on his own terms, or through the ex's own disclosure. \n\nSo the key points are: Did the author have the right to share that information? The author's intention was to warn the new BF, but the method involved direct contact without the ex's consent. This could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the content was true. \n\nIn many cases, the consensus is that sharing such information without being asked can be considered meddling. The new BF has the right to ask the ex about her past, and if she chooses not to disclose, that's her decision. The author's action might have caused unnecessary harm, leading to the breakup and the ex's friends turning against him. \n\nTherefore, while the author's intention was to inform, the action of directly contacting the new BF without being asked is likely in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
