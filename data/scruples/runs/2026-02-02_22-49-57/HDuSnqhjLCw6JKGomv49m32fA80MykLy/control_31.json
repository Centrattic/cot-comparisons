I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated on them. The ex had cheated, which the author found out about through a friend. They confronted the ex, she confessed, and they broke up. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the author emailed him to tell about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of this. The ex and her friends, who were stolen from the author, are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about whether the author had the right to inform the new boyfriend. On one hand, the ex did cheat, so there's a valid reason for the author to be upset. On the other hand, the author took the matter into their own hands by contacting the new BF without the ex's consent. \n\nEthically, is it okay to tell someone's new partner about past infidelity? Some people might say that the new BF has a right to know, especially if the ex lied about her history. But others might argue that the author shouldn't have shared that information without the ex's permission. The author's motivation was to protect the new BF, but did they overstep?\n\nAlso, the ex's friends are now taking her side, possibly because they only heard her version of the story. The author's actions might have made things worse by causing the new BF to break up with her, leading to backlash. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intent was to warn someone they thought was being deceived. However, the method involved contacting the new BF directly, which could be seen as invasive. Even if the information is true, sharing it without the ex's consent might be considered a breach of privacy. The author might be justified in wanting to inform the new partner, but the way they did it could be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions, while well-intentioned, crossed a line by not respecting the ex's privacy. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for taking that step without considering the consequences or the ex's right to disclose her own past.\n"
