I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The situation is that the ex cheated, they broke up, and then the author contacted the new BF. Now the ex and her friends are upset, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Telling someone else's ex about cheating is a sensitive issue. The author's reasoning is that they wanted the new BF to know because they themselves would want to know if their partner had cheated. But is that justification enough?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the new BF has a right to know about the ex's past behavior, especially if it affects the current relationship. Cheating is a significant issue, and the BF deserves to be informed if he's in a new relationship with someone who was unfaithful in the past. The author might argue self-preservation, wanting to prevent the new BF from being hurt the same way they were.\n\nOn the other hand, the author took it upon themselves to act without going through the ex to inform the new BF. This could be seen as violating privacy and trust. Even if the ex cheated, the author isn't the one to disclose that information to a third party. The ex has the responsibility to be honest with her new partner. The author's action could be considered meddling in a new relationship and possibly causing unnecessary harm, even if the intent was good.\n\nAlso, the ex and her friends are upset because they believe the author is the villain. The author's friends might not know the full story, which adds to the conflict. The key here is whether the author's action crossed the line into interfering in the ex's new relationship without a legitimate reason.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action was a breach of privacy. Even if the ex was unfaithful, the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to inform the new BF. The appropriate action would have been to let the ex handle the disclosure herself. By doing it directly, the author overstepped, which is why the ex and friends are upset. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
