I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. The situation is that the ex cheated, they had a messy breakup, and now the ex has a new partner. The author sent an email to the new BF revealing the infidelity, which led to the new BF breaking up with her. Now, the author is being called an asshole by the ex and friends who believe her version.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the action. The author's intent was to warn the new BF about their partner's past behavior. They felt it was important to share this information because if they were in the BF's position, they'd want to know. However, sharing someone's private information without their consent is usually considered a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was good, the method might be questionable.\n\nIn relationships, there's a concept called \"the friend zone\" where people might spread information about their exes to partners. But doing so can be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. The ex cheated, but the author's action of informing the new BF could be seen as retaliatory or damaging. Even if the story is true, the author didn't go through the ex to share this info, which could be a factor in the judgment.\n\nAlso, the ex and friends are siding with her, suggesting they don't believe the author's account. This might indicate that the author's communication approach was flawed or that there's a bias in the social circle. The author's actions might have caused further harm by disrupting the new relationship, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was protecting the new BF from potential heartbreak if the ex continued cheating. But the ethical dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. Telling someone about an ex's infidelity without their consent can be manipulative. It's a gray area, but in many cases, people are advised not to interfere in their ex's new relationships unless there's a legal or safety concern.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action, while possibly motivated by a desire to protect someone, was done without the ex's permission and could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they exposed someone's private information without consent, which can be harmful regardless of the intent.\n"
