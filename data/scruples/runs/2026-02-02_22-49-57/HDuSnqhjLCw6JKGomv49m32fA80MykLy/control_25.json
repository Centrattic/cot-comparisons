I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, the person found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up. Five months later, the ex starts dating someone new. The person contacts the new boyfriend via email to inform him about the cheating. The new boyfriend breaks up with her because of this info. Now, the ex and mutual friends (who believe her side) are calling the person an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The person is sharing private information about their ex's infidelity with the new partner. The question is whether this is justified or not. \n\nOn one hand, the person might think they're doing the right thing by protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on. They might feel that the ex was dishonest and that the new BF has a right to know. \n\nBut on the other hand, the person is invading the ex's privacy and potentially ruining her new relationship without her consent. Even if the ex was wrong, sharing that information could be seen as retaliatory or interfering. \n\nThe person's actions led to the breakup of the ex's new relationship, which might be considered harmful. Also, the ex's friends who now side with her don't know the full story because the person didn't share their side. \n\nLegally, unless there's some specific law about sharing such information, it's more a matter of ethics. Ethically, it's about respecting privacy vs. preventing harm. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to share private details of past relationships with new partners because it can be seen as manipulative. The person might have felt justified, but others might see it as overstepping. \n\nThe fact that the person's ex is getting support from friends who don't know the full story suggests that the person's approach might not have been the best. Maybe they should have focused on moving on rather than interfering. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the person likely overstepped their boundaries by sharing personal information that led to the breakup. They might not have the right to act as an informant in the new relationship. Therefore, the answer would be that they are in the wrong.\n"
