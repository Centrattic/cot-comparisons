      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and now the ex has started dating someone new. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend about the cheating, leading to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex. The ex and her friends are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. \n\nOn one hand, the author felt that the new boyfriend had a right to know about the ex's past infidelity. The author's reasoning is that if their own partner had cheated, they would want to know. So there's a sense of wanting to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is upset that the author went to the new boyfriend directly, which could be seen as interfering or not respecting boundaries. The ex's friends are taking her side, even though the author claims they told them the truth. The author might have overstepped by contacting the new boyfriend without the ex's consent, even if their intention was good.\n\nI need to consider whether the author's actions were justified. In many cases, people might argue that it's not their place to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if they have bad information. However, if there's a genuine concern about the new partner being misled, some might see it as a warning.\n\nBut legally and ethically, sharing someone else's private information without consent can be problematic. The author might have violated privacy by revealing the ex's cheating to another person. Even if it's true, the method of disclosure could be seen as malicious or vengeful, especially if it's done with the intent to sabotage the new relationship.\n\nThe ex's friends believing her over the author might suggest that the author's communication wasn't effective or that they came across as hostile. The author's friends who were stolen might feel caught in the middle, but the main issue is the direct contact to the new boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had a valid reason to be upset and wanted to protect the new boyfriend. However, the way they went about it\u2014without the ex's consent and directly contacting the new partner\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, while the author's intent might be understandable, the action itself is questionable. It depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. Some might say the author is in the right because they're being honest about their ex's past, while others say it's meddling in another person's affairs.\n\nI think the answer here is more likely \"A\" (the author is in the wrong) because intervening in a new relationship by sharing potentially damaging information without consent is generally considered inappropriate, regardless of the reason.\n"
