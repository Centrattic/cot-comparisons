I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The person is engaged with a fianc\u00e9 who is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and it's causing them sleep problems. They've been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is a light sleeper, which is a valid reason for needing a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author has tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The problem has been ongoing for a long time, especially with two kids involved. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that sleeping separately would make them just roommates. But the author's main issue is their health and well-being. Chronic sleep issues can lead to other problems like stress, fatigue, and even health issues. The author is prioritizing their own well-being, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is rejecting the relationship or not making an effort. But the author has tried to adjust as much as possible. The situation seems to be a matter of incompatible sleep habits, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nSeparate rooms isn't an unusual solution. Some couples choose this for various reasons\u2014like different schedules, snoring, etc. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they've exhausted other options and the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make necessary changes, suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable step. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate need for rest and health. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not seeing the problem as severe, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
