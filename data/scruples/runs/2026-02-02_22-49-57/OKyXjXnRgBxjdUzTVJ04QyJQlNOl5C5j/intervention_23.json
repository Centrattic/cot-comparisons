I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms due to their fianc\u00e9's snoring and TV habits. They want a yes or no answer as A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy snorer who watches loud TV before bed. This has been going on for 8 years with two kids. The author is exhausted and finally suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they can't share a bed. The author just wants good sleep.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The core issue is about the author's need for rest versus the fianc\u00e9's habits. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing significant distress, and the author has tried compromising (like lowering the volume a bit) but it's not enough. The author's health and well-being are at stake here. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key, but when one person's needs are causing harm to the other's health, it's a different matter. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious health issues. The author is seeking a solution to improve their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about the symbolism of sleeping in the same room rather than the actual issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting or not considering the emotional aspect of their relationship. But the author has been dealing with this for years, so it's not a new or minor issue. \n\nI think the author is justified in their request. They're not being selfish; they're trying to resolve a long-standing problem that's affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9 could also work on changing his habits, like using earplugs or finding quieter entertainment, but the author's solution is a reasonable step if other compromises haven't worked. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
