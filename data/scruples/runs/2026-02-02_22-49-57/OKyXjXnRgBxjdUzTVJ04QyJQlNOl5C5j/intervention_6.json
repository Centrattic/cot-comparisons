I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation. The author's fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and snores very loudly. He also insists on having the TV on at a high volume, which the author finds disruptive. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, engaged for a year, and have two kids. The author is a light sleeper and can't get a good night's rest, leading to frustration and the suggestion to sleep separately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here: sleep deprivation. Chronic lack of sleep can affect mental health, mood, and overall well-being. The author's frustration is understandable, especially given the long-term nature of the problem and the presence of children, which might add to the stress. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a different need for a louder environment to sleep, possibly due to his own sensitivity to sound or a habit developed over time.\n\nNext, the author's action: suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's unnecessary and implying that sharing a bed is a fundamental part of a relationship. But the author's main concern is their own health and rest. I should think about whether the author's request is reasonable. Couples often face compromises, and if the fianc\u00e9's habits are making the author's sleep impossible, then the author has a right to prioritize their health. However, the abruptness of the suggestion might come off as extreme. Maybe there were other steps they could have taken first, like trying a white noise machine, earplugs, or discussing the issue more calmly to find a middle ground. \n\nBut the problem has been ongoing for a long time, and the author mentions that even when the fianc\u00e9 compromises, it's only a slight reduction. The fianc\u00e9's actions are affecting the author's quality of life, and the author is trying to find a solution. Suggesting separate rooms might be a last resort. In relationships, communication is key. The author might have tried talking about it multiple times without success. If the fianc\u00e9 is actually open to compromise but hasn't found a solution that works for both, then the author's frustration is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that their relationship is about more than just sleeping arrangements, and he might feel that the suggestion undermines the commitment. But the author isn't saying they don't want to be a couple; they're just seeking better rest. The question is whether the author's approach is wrong. While the method might be a bit drastic, the underlying need is legitimate. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be about the emotional aspect rather than the practical problem of sleep. \n\nAlso, considering the 8-year partnership and being engaged, it's a serious commitment. If the fianc\u00e9 is willing to try solutions but the author feels that nothing works, then separate rooms could be a reasonable compromise. The key point here is that both partners have valid needs, and the author's request isn't about rejecting the relationship but about self-care. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be a bit dramatic, but the situation is complex. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. Their request is a practical solution to a long-standing issue that affects their well-being. While better communication could have been attempted, the situation seems to have escalated due to the fianc\u00e9's sleep habits being incompatible with the author's needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
