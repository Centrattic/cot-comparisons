I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and likes to have the TV on. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise, leading to bad sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not a good idea for couples to not share a bed, but the author just wants rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for sleep is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health, mood, and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits are well-known and have been an issue for years. The author might feel that this is a necessary step for their well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or that the relationship is changing, which is why he's upset.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They're asking for a solution to a long-standing problem that's affecting their quality of life. Suggesting separate rooms is a practical solution when compromise isn't working. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect of the relationship rather than the sleep issue. The key here is whether the author's request is unreasonable. Since they've tried compromises (lowering the volume slightly), but it's not enough, the author isn't being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the problem, not the author's request for a better sleep environment.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a legitimate need that's been ignored for a long time.\n"
