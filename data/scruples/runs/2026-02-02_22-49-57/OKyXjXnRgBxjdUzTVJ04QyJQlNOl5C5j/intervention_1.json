I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper who wants quiet at night. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 even says he can't hear the TV if the volume is turned down, even when he's asleep. The author has been dealing with this for eight years, with one year of engagement and two kids. They've had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking this is the end of their relationship.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the impact on health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The author is trying to find a solution to a problem that's been ongoing. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity. Suggesting separate rooms doesn't necessarily mean the end of the relationship. Many couples do this for various reasons. The author is prioritizing their well-being. It's about finding a compromise that works for both. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't shown willingness to adjust his habits, like sleeping without the TV or using a white noise machine. The author's action is a last resort after years of suffering. \n\nI think the author is justified because they're addressing a legitimate issue affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9 isn't making accommodations, so the author's decision is reasonable. Answer B.\n"
