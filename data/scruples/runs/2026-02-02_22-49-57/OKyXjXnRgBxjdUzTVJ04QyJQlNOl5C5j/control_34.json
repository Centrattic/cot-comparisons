I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for suggesting separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9's snoring and TV habits disrupt their sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who can't hear the TV if it's turned down, and he insists on having it on at a loud volume. The user is a light sleeper, which is causing them stress and bad sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's need for the TV on might be due to personal preference or even a coping mechanism. Maybe he can't sleep without it. But the user's health and well-being are also important. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious health issues. The user has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9's argument that sleeping separately makes them just roommates seems a bit extreme. Relationships aren't solely about sharing a bed; communication and mutual respect are key.\n\nThe user's solution might be drastic, but it's a valid attempt to address a long-standing problem. They tried compromising by having the fianc\u00e9 lower the volume a bit, but it's still not enough. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he might not see the severity of the situation. It's about finding a balance where both partners' needs are met. The user isn't wrong for seeking a solution that prioritizes their health. So, the answer would likely be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
