I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The context is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear if the volume is lower, and this has been going on for years with kids involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted, which affects their health and well-being. Chronic sleep issues can lead to various health problems, so it's a valid concern. They've tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's still causing problems. The author's proposal is to sleep in separate rooms, which is a common solution for couples with incompatible sleep habits.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's response suggests he sees this as a relationship issue. He argues that not sharing a bed undermines their commitment, comparing it to just being roommates. That's a common misconception. However, people have different needs, and sometimes practical solutions are necessary. The fact that they've been together for 8 years and engaged for a year, with two kids, adds weight to the idea that the author is seeking a long-term solution to a persistent problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health, and they've tried compromises without success. The author's decision to prioritize their health isn't inherently wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not recognizing the severity of the sleep issues or feeling that the author isn't trying hard enough. But given the duration and the impact on the author's life, the author's stance is reasonable.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their well-being, and suggesting separate rooms is a practical solution when other compromises haven't worked. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid but doesn't override the author's need for rest.\n"
