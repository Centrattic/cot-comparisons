I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged, has been with their fianc\u00e9 for 8 years, engaged for a year, and they have two kids. The main issue is their sleep habits. The author is a light sleeper and wants a quiet, distraction-free environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and insists on watching TV at a high volume while sleeping. The author says this has been going on for a long time, and they finally had enough, suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he thinks that undermines their relationship, saying if they can't share a bed, why be together. The author just wants good sleep.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic poor sleep can affect health, mood, and overall well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. The author tried to compromise (lowering the volume a bit) but it's not enough. After eight years, this seems like a long-standing issue that's not been resolved, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is based on the idea that sleeping separately is a sign of not wanting to be in the relationship. However, the author's motivation is health and well-being, not a desire to separate. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting the author's quality of life. \n\nIs suggesting separate rooms a reasonable solution? In many relationships, couples do sleep in separate beds or rooms for various reasons, like differing sleep schedules, snoring, or medical issues. It's a practical solution when mutual compromise isn't possible. The fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to adjust (except minimally) suggests he's not open to finding a middle ground. The author's suggestion is a way to protect their own health, which is important.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9's perspective might feel rejected. However, the author is not ending the relationship, just seeking a solution to a longstanding problem. The fianc\u00e9's argument about roommates is a bit extreme; roommates can share a home but not a bedroom, so that comparison might not hold. The key is whether the author's action is a reasonable response to a persistent issue that affects their well-being.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a significant, unresolved problem that's affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are not accommodating, and the author is seeking a solution that's necessary for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about feeling rejected than the actual issue. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
