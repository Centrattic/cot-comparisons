I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV very loudly at night. They've been dealing with this for 8 years together and 1 year engaged, with two kids. The author is finally fed up and suggests separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea because they can't share a bed, implying it's important for their relationship.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's right to a good night's sleep versus the fianc\u00e9's habits. The fianc\u00e9's TV usage is causing significant disturbance, and the author has tried to get him to lower the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's health and well-being are being affected by the lack of sleep.\n\nNow, considering that they are engaged and have kids, their relationship is established. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the symbolism of sharing a bed, but practicality is a big factor here. If they can't find a solution that works for both, suggesting separate rooms might be a reasonable step to prioritize health. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior is problematic because he's being inconsiderate of his partner's needs. The author is looking for a solution that benefits both their well-being. While sleeping in separate rooms might feel like a big step, it's a valid choice if they can't resolve the issue otherwise. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason based on their sleep issues, which can affect their health and daily functioning. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more focused on the romantic aspect rather than the practical problem at hand.\n"
