I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants to sleep in separate rooms because the partner is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and causes noise, which affects the author's sleep. They've been together for 8 years with two kids. The partner thinks that if they can't share a bed, maybe they should just be roommates.\n\nHmm. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time. The partner's habits are causing significant sleep disruption. The author tried to compromise by lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. Now the author is suggesting separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the factors here. Sleep is essential for health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, but nothing is working. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a different sleep pattern and uses the TV as a sleep aid, which might be a personal preference or maybe even a way to cope with something else, like anxiety or insomnia. However, the noise is affecting the author's well-being.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find solutions that work for both partners. The author is taking a drastic step, but maybe they've exhausted all other options. They mentioned trying to lower the volume a few points, but that's not enough. Are there other alternatives? Maybe using earplugs, white noise machines, or different sleeping arrangements within the same house but separate rooms. But the author has tried and it's not working. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that not sharing a bed undermines the relationship. But relationships also require mutual respect for each other's needs. If both partners can't meet each other's needs without significant conflict, then the solution might be necessary. The author isn't suggesting ending the relationship but just improving their quality of life. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to address a legitimate issue that affects their health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, and the author is seeking a solution. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the principle of not sharing a bed rather than addressing the sleep problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're advocating for their well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
