I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to sleep in separate rooms from their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows at night, and snores a lot. The author is a light sleeper and this has been going on for 8 years with two kids. They\u2019re engaged, so they\u2019re clearly in a committed relationship.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep disruption. The author has been dealing with this for a long time, which might indicate that previous attempts to resolve the issue haven't worked. The fianc\u00e9's response is to question the point of being a couple if they can't share a bed, which seems more like a defensive reaction rather than a genuine attempt to find a solution.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author has tried to compromise before by lowering the volume a bit. But the problem persists. The author's main concern is their health and well-being due to lack of proper rest. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious effects, so it's a valid concern.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they should just be roommates if they can't share a bed is a bit of a red herring. Roommates can also have different sleeping schedules and preferences, but couples are supposed to make accommodations for each other. However, when those accommodations are impossible due to one person's habits that affect the other's health, it's reasonable to seek a solution, even if it means separate rooms.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make sacrifices. But if one partner's needs are consistently causing harm to the other, that's a problem. The author isn't rejecting the relationship; they're asking for a practical solution to a long-standing issue. It's also mentioned they have kids, so the stress from poor sleep could impact their ability to care for the children as well.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for suggesting a compromise that addresses their legitimate needs. The fianc\u00e9's resistance seems to stem from not seeing the issue's severity. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
