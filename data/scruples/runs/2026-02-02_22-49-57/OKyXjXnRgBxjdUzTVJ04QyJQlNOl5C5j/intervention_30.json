I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on watching TV at a high volume before bed. Despite some compromise where the fianc\u00e9 lowers the volume a bit, the noise from the TV and his snoring still disturb the author. The author has been dealing with this for eight years and two years as fianc\u00e9s. They have two kids, so their sleep must be even more crucial. The author decided to take a stand and suggested separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking that not sharing a bed would make them just roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's right to a good night's sleep is important for their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so the author has a valid concern. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that the suggestion undermines their relationship, suggesting that the author is prioritizing comfort over togetherness.\n\nBut let's think about what's reasonable. Living together often involves compromises, but there's a limit when one's health and well-being are affected. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. The author has tried to make some compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume slightly, but it's not enough. The author is also considering the long-term effects of this situation, especially with their children. If they don't address this now, it could lead to more serious issues down the line.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that not sharing a bed negates the couple's relationship is a bit extreme. Many couples choose to sleep in separate rooms for various reasons, including health, and it doesn't necessarily mean they're not committed. The key here is communication and finding a solution that works for both. However, the author's well-being shouldn't be sacrificed for the sake of maintaining a shared bedroom if it's causing them harm.\n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9's snoring and TV habits might indicate something else, like sleep apnea. If that's the case, it's a medical issue that should be addressed. The author could suggest that the fianc\u00e9 see a doctor. But even if that's not the case, the noise from the TV is still a problem. The author is within their rights to seek a solution that allows them to get restful sleep.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and accommodation are important. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected or not being prioritized. However, the author's need for sleep is a basic necessity. It's not about being right or wrong in a moral sense, but about the balance between personal needs and relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being, which is essential. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more considerate of the author's needs and find a compromise that works for both, like using earplugs, a white noise machine, or perhaps the author using a separate room occasionally. The suggestion of separate rooms is a drastic step, but given the circumstances, it's understandable.\n"
