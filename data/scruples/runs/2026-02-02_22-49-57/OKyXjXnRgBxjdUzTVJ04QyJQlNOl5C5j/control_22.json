I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper and wants a quiet room. Their partner is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches TV at high volume. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested sleeping in separate rooms. The partner is against it, thinking it's a bad idea because they'd just be roommates. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, first, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is sleep deprivation due to their partner's habits. They've tried to compromise, but the partner's TV volume is still too loud, and the snoring is a problem. The author is trying to get a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. On the other hand, the partner is used to their own sleep habits and might feel that separate rooms are a step back from their relationship.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. But in this case, the author has tried to lower the volume a bit, but it's still causing them distress. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. If the partner is unwilling to make more significant changes, the author's decision to sleep separately might be a reasonable solution. It's not about being in the wrong; it's about addressing a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life.\n\nAlso, they have two kids, so their health and functioning as a parent are important. The partner's argument about being roommates is a bit extreme, as couples often have separate rooms for various reasons. It's not necessarily a reflection on the relationship's strength. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They're taking steps to take care of their health and well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
