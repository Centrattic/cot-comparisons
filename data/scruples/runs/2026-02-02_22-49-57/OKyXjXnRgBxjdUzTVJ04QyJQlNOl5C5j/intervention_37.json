I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when suggesting to sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who also snores a lot and watches TV at a high volume. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years and had enough, so they suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to partner's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can be a big problem, affecting health and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits seem to be causing this, and he's not really compromising much. Even when he lowers the volume, it's only by a few points, which might not be enough. The author has tried to communicate, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't responsive, even asleep when he wakes up to complain. That shows he's not actively trying to adjust.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 sees the suggestion as a deal-breaker, comparing it to being roommates. But marriage often requires compromises, and the author's health is at stake. The fact that they've been together for 8 years and have kids suggests this is a long-term issue. The author might feel that their well-being is important, and a good night's sleep is necessary. \n\nNow, considering relationship norms, some couples do choose separate beds for various reasons. It's not uncommon as long as both are on board. But in this case, the author is trying to find a solution to a problem caused by the partner's behavior. The fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to adjust could be part of the problem. The author is seeking a solution that prioritizes their health, which is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is addressing a legitimate issue that's affecting their quality of life, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't making sufficient efforts to compromise. The key points are the long-term struggle, the health impact of poor sleep, and the lack of effective compromise from the fianc\u00e9.\n"
