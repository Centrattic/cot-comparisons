I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows and snores a lot. They've been dealing with this for years, and the author finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can be a big problem, affecting health and relationships. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might feel that the suggestion to sleep separately is a rejection or a step towards breaking up, especially since they have kids and have been engaged for a year. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates instead of a couple is a common argument. Some people might see separate rooms as the end of intimacy, but others might see it as a necessary compromise for well-being. The author's point is that they want to be a couple but need to function properly. \n\nI should consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, couples sharing a bed is the norm, but there are exceptions. Some couples do sleep separately for various reasons without it affecting their relationship negatively. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress, and the author has tried compromising (like adjusting the volume a little), but it's not enough. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have two kids. Lack of sleep can affect parenting, which adds another layer of concern. The fianc\u00e9's habit of sleeping with the TV on might indicate deeper issues, like possible sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea), which could be worth addressing medically.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be emotional, focusing on the symbolic meaning of sleeping together, while the author is focusing on practical needs. The question is whether the author is prioritizing their needs in a reasonable way. Since the author has endured this for years, their decision to seek a solution isn't unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also valid. He might feel that the suggestion is a major change that disrupts their current dynamic. But the author isn't suggesting separation; just separate rooms. It's a practical solution rather than a romantic one. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a legitimate need for rest, which is essential for health. The fianc\u00e9 needs to consider that the author's well-being is crucial for both the relationship and the children. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
