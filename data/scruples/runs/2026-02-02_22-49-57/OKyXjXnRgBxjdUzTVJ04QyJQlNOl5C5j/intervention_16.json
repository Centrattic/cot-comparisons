I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue seems to be their sleep habits clashing. The author is a light sleeper, needs a quiet environment, while the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and insists on having the TV on at a loud volume. They've been together 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The author has tried to compromise, but the situation is causing consistent sleep deprivation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been dealing with this for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing significant distress and health issues (poor sleep). The author is seeking a solution to a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant, comparing the situation to roommates, which seems dismissive of the author's well-being.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author has tried to adjust (lowering the volume a bit), but the problem persists. The author's request for a separate room is to address their basic need for rest, which is essential for health. The fianc\u00e9's argument about the point of being a couple seems to conflate practical cohabitation with the emotional bond. Roommates can have separate rooms too, but the issue here is the lack of consideration for the partner's needs.\n\nThe author isn't suggesting ending the relationship but a practical adjustment to improve quality of life. Given the length of the relationship and the presence of children, it's a long-term issue that needs a sustainable solution. The author's frustration is valid. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they're advocating for their health and well-being in a long-term commitment.\n"
