I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a fianc\u00e9 who is a light sleeper, and their partner is a heavy sleeper and requires the TV on loudly. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, with the engagement lasting 1 year and two kids. The partner doesn't seem to be willing to compromise, and the author is exhausted and wants better sleep. \n\nSo the core issue is the bedroom arrangement. The author is trying to communicate their need for a quiet environment to sleep, which is a basic need. The partner, on the other hand, has a different requirement (TV on loudly) that's causing conflict. The author tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but it's still not sufficient. \n\nNow, considering the options: AITA? The question is whether the author is wrong for suggesting separate rooms. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author has been patient for years and has tried to make compromises. If the partner isn't willing to adjust their habits to accommodate the author's needs, then it's reasonable for the author to seek a solution that preserves their well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and overall quality of life. \n\nThe partner's response seems to trivialize the author's request, equating it to being roommates, which is dismissive. The author's reasoning is about health and well-being, not just preference. So, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate need and are advocating for their own health. The partner's refusal to find a compromise without considering the author's side makes the author's decision justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
