I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV, and the author is a light sleeper who can't tolerate the noise. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not the point of being a couple if they don't share a bed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disturbed every night, leading to poor rest. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a different sleep routine and might not realize how disruptive it is. The author tried to compromise by turning down the volume, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship dynamics\u2014sleeping apart might feel like just being roommates.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key factors are communication, mutual respect, and willingness to find solutions. The author has been dealing with this for a long time and finally reached a breaking point. Suggesting separate rooms is a solution to their personal problem. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also valid because sharing a bed is a common part of a romantic relationship. The question is whether the author overstepped by making the suggestion without finding a middle ground.\n\nBut considering the impact on health and well-being from lack of sleep, the author has a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, while not malicious, is causing harm. The author is trying to address a long-standing issue. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for their needs. The fianc\u00e9's response might be more about feeling hurt or not seeing the problem's severity. The right answer here would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason and are seeking a solution that's necessary for their well-being.\n"
