I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 suggests sleeping in separate rooms because the other partner is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV, and causes sleep disturbances. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it would make them just roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author is a light sleeper, which is a valid reason for needing a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring loudly and watching TV at a high volume\u2014are impacting the author's sleep. They've been together for 8 years, so this has been an ongoing issue. The author finally suggested separate rooms, which the fianc\u00e9 is unhappy with. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, both partners should make efforts for each other's comfort. However, if one's needs can't be met through compromise, then it's reasonable to seek a solution. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on the TV volume and inability to adjust might be the main problem here. The author's request for a good night's sleep is understandable, especially after years of struggle. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed seems a bit extreme. The core issue is the sleep disturbance, not the act of sharing a room. The author's suggestion is practical for their well-being. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable, aside from the suddenness of the demand. However, given the long-term problem, it's a justified action. \n\nI don't see the author's actions as wrong. They're seeking a solution to a persistent problem that affects their health and happiness. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the primary issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
