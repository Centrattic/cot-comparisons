I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who also needs the TV on at a loud volume. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9's snoring and the TV are causing sleep problems for the author, leading to the suggestion of separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid complaint about not getting enough sleep because of their partner's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being, so it's a serious issue. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might have his own reasons for needing the TV on, maybe to help him fall asleep or as a habit. However, the volume is still too loud for the author, even after some compromise.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But the author is engaged and has two kids with this person, so the relationship is long-term and committed. The question is, is it reasonable for the author to ask for separate rooms to get proper rest? \n\nI think the key points here are the length of the relationship and the fact that the author has tried to compromise (the volume being lowered a little). The fianc\u00e9's snoring and TV use have been ongoing issues without resolution. The author's health and need for sleep are important, and if the situation is causing significant distress, suggesting a separate room might be a reasonable step. \n\nBut wait, maybe there are other solutions they haven't tried. Like using white noise machines, earplugs, or maybe the fianc\u00e9 could use a CPAP machine if his snoring is due to sleep apnea. The author could also use a sleep mask or maybe a different type of mattress. However, the post doesn't mention that they've tried these alternatives. \n\nStill, given the time they've been together and the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to make more adjustments (like turning the TV off completely or using lower volume consistently), the author's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's response that it would make them roommates seems dismissive of the author's needs. \n\nIn relationships, partners are expected to accommodate each other's needs, but there's a limit when it affects one's health. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. They're trying to address a real problem that's impacting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9 might need to be more considerate and explore other solutions instead of reacting negatively. \n\nBut I also need to consider if suggesting separate rooms is too drastic. Maybe the author could have proposed other options first, like separate beds in the same room. However, the situation has been going on for a long time, and if those options didn't work, separate rooms might be necessary. \n\nOverall, the author seems to be in the right because they're seeking a solution to a legitimate issue after years of struggling. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is what's more questionable here.\n"
