I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. They're a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and needs the TV on loud. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear if the volume is turned down, even when he's asleep. The person is frustrated after 8 years and wants to sleep well. The fianc\u00e9 is against the idea, saying they might as well be roommates.\n\nFirst, consider the needs: the author's need for sleep is crucial for health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits (TV volume, snoring) are causing this. The author has tried compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The situation has been going on for years, so it's not a new issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But the author isn't proposing separation, just separate rooms. They're still a couple with kids. The key point is mutual respect and finding solutions. The author is trying to address their legitimate need, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's TV habit is affecting the author's well-being. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 can try earplugs or white noise machines, or adjust his sleeping habits. But if those don't work, separate rooms might be a practical solution. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their health. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
