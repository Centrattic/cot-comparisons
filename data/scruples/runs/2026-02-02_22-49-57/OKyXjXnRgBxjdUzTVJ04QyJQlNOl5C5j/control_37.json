I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and it's affecting their sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, sleeps with the TV on at a high volume, and can't hear when it's turned down. The author has been dealing with this for a long time (8 years together, engaged for 1, two kids). The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, why be a couple instead of roommates.\n\nNow, considering typical AITA scenarios, people often look for balance between personal needs and the relationship. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive and have been ongoing for years, with some minor compromises (lowering volume by 3 points). The author's request to sleep separately is a solution to a long-standing problem.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests that he values the shared sleeping arrangement as part of the relationship. However, the author's health and well-being are also important. The question is whether the author is overreacting or making a reasonable request. Since the problem has persisted for so long and the author is seeking a solution that doesn't involve staying in an unhealthy situation, it's more likely they aren't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be resisting change but doesn't address the author's legitimate needs.\n\nI should also consider if there were alternatives. Maybe they could try different solutions first, like earplugs, a white noise machine, or a different bedroom setup. But the author has tried those? The post doesn't mention that. However, the main issue is that the author's sleep is consistently ruined, leading to their decision. The fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust despite some compromise might make the author's decision reasonable.\n\nSo, in AITA scenarios, the community often sides with the person making a reasonable request to improve their quality of life. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
