I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is the noise from the fianc\u00e9's TV and snoring, which is affecting the author's sleep. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time, even after being engaged and having kids. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and snores loudly. He also watches action movies with loud sounds and requires the TV to be on. The author is tired of not getting enough rest because of this. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't think separate rooms are a good idea and questions the point of being a couple if they can't share a bed. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From what I read, the author is advocating for their own well-being, which is important. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts, so it's reasonable for them to seek a solution. Suggesting separate rooms is a drastic step, but given the circumstances and the time they've been together (8 years and engaged for 1), it's possible that the author has tried other solutions and this is the last resort.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side is also considered. He might feel that separate rooms are a rejection or a sign of relationship problems. However, the author's intent is to get a good night's sleep, not to end the relationship. They mentioned that the kids are involved, so maybe separate rooms are a practical solution for their family dynamic. \n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe using earplugs, a white noise machine, or a sleep apnea device for snoring. But the author might have tried those and found them ineffective. The fianc\u00e9's habit of turning up the TV when the author lowers it could be a pattern that's hard to change. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is addressing a legitimate need. While it's a significant decision, the right to a good night's sleep is valid. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's status, which might be an overreaction. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to improve their sleep. The answer is B.\n"
