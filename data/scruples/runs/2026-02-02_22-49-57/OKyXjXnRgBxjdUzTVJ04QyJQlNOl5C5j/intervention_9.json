I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 has a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV, which is disturbing the author's sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main issue is sleep deprivation due to their partner's habits. Sleeping with the TV on at a loud volume and snoring that's as loud as a train is pretty disruptive. The fianc\u00e9's response is that if they can't share a bed, then what's the point of being a couple rather than roommates. \n\nNow, the key points here are the couple's long-term relationship and the significant impact on the author's well-being. The author isn't suggesting ending the relationship but seeking a solution to a recurring problem. The fianc\u00e9's behavior seems inconsiderate, especially since the author has been dealing with this for years. The author's proposal is a practical solution to their immediate problem, not a rejection of the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important, but both partners have needs. The author is trying to find a middle ground by suggesting separate rooms to get rest. The fianc\u00e9, however, is not open to this solution, which might reflect a lack of empathy towards the author's needs. The fact that the author has two kids adds another layer, as lack of sleep can affect parenting and overall health.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that sleeping in separate rooms could be seen as creating distance, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable request for the author's well-being. The author isn't at fault here; they're seeking a solution to a problem that's been affecting them for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's behavior (ignoring the problem and dismissing the solution) is more problematic. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
