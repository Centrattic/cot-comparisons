I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 having a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV all night, disturbing the other person's sleep. The writer is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the facts. The fianc\u00e9 is described as a heavy sleeper, which might mean he doesn't respond well to noise complaints even if he's asleep. The TV is on at a loud volume, and he sometimes lowers the volume slightly but not enough. The writer has been trying to sleep through this for 8 years with two kids, which adds stress. The key issue here is the conflict between their sleeping habits and the impact on their relationship.\n\nThe writer's main argument is that they need their own space to get proper rest, which is important for overall health. The fianc\u00e9, however, sees sleeping separately as the end of their relationship, equating it to just being roommates. The user is asking if the writer is in the wrong by suggesting separate rooms.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship advice, some people might argue that couples should make compromises. However, the writer has tried to communicate and compromise before, like when the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume. The problem persists, leading to chronic sleep deprivation, which can have serious health effects. The writer's request is about their well-being, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they should stay in the same bed might be based on traditional views of marriage but doesn't address the practical issue of sleep disruption.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say the writer should have explored other solutions first, like sleeping in a different configuration, using earplugs, or finding a quieter TV show. However, the writer mentions that even when the volume is lowered, it's still too loud, and the fianc\u00e9's deep sleep makes it hard to adjust. The writer's frustration after years of this is understandable.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the key is whether the request is unreasonable. The writer isn't being selfish; they have a legitimate need for rest. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not understanding the long-term effects of sleep deprivation or not seeing the issue as a problem. The writer's proposal to sleep separately is a solution to a real problem they've faced for a long time. Therefore, the writer is not in the wrong because they're prioritizing their health and seeking a practical solution after enduring the situation for years.\n"
