I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 and his partner having different sleep needs. The partner is a light sleeper and needs a quiet, distraction-free environment, while the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who requires the TV on at a loud volume. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The author is frustrated because every night the fianc\u00e9's actions disrupt her sleep, leading her to propose separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The author's request is about her health and well-being. Lack of sleep can have serious consequences, affecting mood, health, and ability to function. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own sleep habits. The key points to consider are communication, compromise, and the long-term impact on the relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that she's tried to ask him to turn down the TV but he ends up waking up and increasing it again. The fianc\u00e9 says he can't hear the TV if it's too low, which suggests that the volume is a significant part of his bedtime routine. He's not being responsive to her needs, which have been ongoing for a long time. The author's decision to suggest separate rooms is a last resort after years of this issue.\n\nSome might argue that sleeping separately could be a solution to avoid the problem, especially if they're already engaged and have kids. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a room, but that's a bit of a hyperbole. The core issue is about respecting each other's needs. The author isn't trying to push him away but to find a way to coexist that allows her to get rest. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior might be unintentionally harmful. He might not realize how much his actions affect her, or he might not be willing to adjust for her sake. The author is advocating for her own well-being, which is a valid concern. The response from the fianc\u00e9 could indicate a lack of willingness to compromise, which might be his part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should work on finding solutions that accommodate both needs. If they can't, then separate arrangements might be necessary. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's trying to solve a recurring issue that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is defensive, which might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nI think the author is justified in her request. It's important for both partners to respect each other's needs, and if that's not possible, separate sleeping arrangements can be a practical solution. The answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
