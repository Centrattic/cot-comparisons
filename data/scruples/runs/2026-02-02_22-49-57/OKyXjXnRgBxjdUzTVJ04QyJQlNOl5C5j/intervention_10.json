I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting to sleep in separate rooms because of their partner's heavy snoring and habit of watching TV loudly at night. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years with two kids involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, which is a common issue, but also insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The author has tried to compromise (lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. The stress of poor sleep over 8 years and now having kids adds to the pressure. The author feels they've had enough and suggested separate rooms, which the fianc\u00e9 is resisting, comparing it to just being roommates instead of a couple.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think about reasonable accommodations in relationships. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid and health-related. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect well-being, relationships, and parenting. The fianc\u00e9's habits, while perhaps not malicious, are causing significant distress. The author's suggestion to sleep separately is a solution to a long-standing problem, not a sudden decision. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the symbolism of sharing a bed rather than the practical issue. However, in a long-term relationship, partners often make compromises. But when those compromises affect health and daily functioning, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their health and the family's well-being. The fianc\u00e9 might need to find alternatives, like a white noise machine or addressing the snoring (maybe a sleep study). So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
