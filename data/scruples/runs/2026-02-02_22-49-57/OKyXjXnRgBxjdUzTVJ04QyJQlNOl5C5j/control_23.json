I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is engaged and has been with their partner for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. They're a light sleeper and the partner is a heavy snorer who also sleeps with the TV on at a loud volume. The author has tried to compromise, but it's not working. The partner can't hear the TV if it's turned down, even in sleep. The author then suggested sleeping in separate rooms, but the partner is against it, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nSo the question is, is the author at fault (A) or not (B)?\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author's main issue is the lack of sleep due to the partner's habits. The partner's habits include loud snoring and needing the TV on. The author has tried to find a solution, but nothing works. The partner's response is emotional, suggesting that separate rooms would make them just roommates. \n\nNow, I need to consider what's reasonable here. Sleep is a basic need, and chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The author has been dealing with this for years, which is a long time. The partner's habits are affecting the author's well-being. The partner isn't being accommodating, even when the author tries to find a compromise. The partner's reaction to the suggestion is more about the relationship's symbolism rather than the practical issue of sleep.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's habits might be out of control, and maybe they should seek help for their snoring or sleep issues. However, the author's request for separate rooms is a solution to their own well-being. It's important to note that the author isn't suggesting ending the relationship but rather finding a way to coexist comfortably. \n\nIn relationships, partners should make compromises. However, when one's health is at stake, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health. The partner's insistence on their habits despite the harm is the issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The answer is B.\n"
