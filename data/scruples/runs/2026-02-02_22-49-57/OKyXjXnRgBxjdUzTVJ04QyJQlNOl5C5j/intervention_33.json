I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms. The main issue here is the conflict between their sleep habits.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The author has been dealing with this for years, which is affecting their sleep quality. They mention they had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, arguing that sharing a bed is part of being a couple, not just roommates.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about mutual respect and finding solutions. The author's health and well-being are important, and chronic sleep deprivation can have serious effects. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting that, and the author is seeking a solution to improve their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to dismiss the author's needs, focusing on the symbolic aspect of sharing a bed rather than the practical issue of sleep.\n\nSeparate sleeping arrangements can be a valid solution for couples with incompatible sleep needs. It's not about wanting to be roommates but about addressing a real problem. The author has tried to compromise (like lowering the TV volume a bit), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might indicate a lack of understanding or empathy. \n\nAlso, considering they have two kids and have been together a long time, maintaining a healthy relationship should involve accommodating each other's needs. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust his habits or find other solutions, like using earplugs or a white noise machine. But if those aren't working, separate rooms could be necessary.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. The author isn't wrong for seeking a solution that affects their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates oversimplifies the issue. So, the answer is probably B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
