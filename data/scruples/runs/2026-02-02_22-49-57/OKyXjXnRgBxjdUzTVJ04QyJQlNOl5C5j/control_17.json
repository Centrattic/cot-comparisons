I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong when suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The author is engaged, has two kids, and they've been together for 8 years. The main issue is sleep\u2014she's a light sleeper, and her fianc\u00e9 is a heavy one, snores a lot, and watches TV at a loud volume. She can't take it anymore and wants to sleep in a separate room. He's upset, thinking it's like being roommates instead of a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her request is reasonable. The key points here are about mutual respect and the impact of his habits on her well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can be serious, affecting health and relationships. If he's not willing to make changes, maybe the solution isn't wrong. But is there a middle ground? Maybe she could have tried other solutions first, like earplugs, a white noise machine, or discussing the issue earlier. However, she mentions she's been dealing with this for a long time, so it's possible she's already tried those. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that this is a significant change that affects their relationship dynamic. But the core of the problem is his refusal to adjust his behavior. If he's asleep while the TV is on, maybe he's not fully aware of the disturbance. Still, she's the one suffering. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. If he can't adjust his habits and she can't function without sleep, her decision to prioritize her health might be justified. The fact that they have kids adds another layer, as parents need rest to care for their children. So, the author's action might be a reasonable step to maintain her well-being and the marriage long-term. \n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently. Instead of abruptly saying \"separate rooms,\" maybe a more collaborative discussion. However, the situation shows she's at her breaking point. \n\nOverall, while the fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution to a long-standing issue that affects her health. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
