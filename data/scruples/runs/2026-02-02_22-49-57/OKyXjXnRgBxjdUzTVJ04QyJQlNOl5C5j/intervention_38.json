I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The context is that they're engaged, have been together for 8 years with two kids, and the fianc\u00e9 has a heavy sleeper who keeps the TV on loudly. The author is a light sleeper and can't take it anymore, so they suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The fianc\u00e9 is described as a heavy sleeper who can't hear the TV unless it's quite loud. He seems to not be able to adjust even when he's asleep, which is causing the author significant sleep disruption. The author has been dealing with this for a long time, which is affecting their health and well-being. Sleep is important, so chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking that sleeping separately would mean they're just roommates. That's a valid feeling because sharing a bed is a symbol of intimacy and closeness in a relationship. But the author's priority is their health. The question is whether suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution given the circumstances.\n\nI should also consider possible alternatives. Maybe the author tried compromises before, like white noise machines or earplugs, but those might not work if the TV is still on. The fianc\u00e9 might not realize how disruptive his habits are. The author's frustration is clear, especially after 8 years. It's understandable they'd reach a breaking point.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't being unreasonable by prioritizing their health. However, suggesting separate rooms is a drastic step that might affect the relationship dynamics. But given the long-term strain and the fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust despite some compromises, the author's decision could be justified. The fianc\u00e9 might need to be more empathetic and find a solution that respects both their needs. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
