I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper, and the partner is a heavy sleeper who watches loud movies and can't hear if the volume is turned down. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The author is frustrated with the lack of sleep and wants to move to separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both partners have valid needs. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is essential for health and well-being. The partner has a habit that's causing the problem, but he's also a heavy sleeper who can't adjust. The author tried compromising, maybe lowering the volume a bit, but it's still disruptive. After 8 years, this seems to be a recurring issue that's affecting the author's quality of life. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author is trying to address a problem that's been going on for a long time. Suggesting separate rooms is a drastic step, but it's a solution to a real problem. The partner's reaction is to question the relationship itself, which seems a bit extreme. If the partner can't adapt or find another solution, like using earplugs or a white noise machine, maybe he's not being as considerate as he could be. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health and well-being. It's reasonable to seek a solution when a problem is causing significant distress. The fact that they've been together so long and this is still an issue might mean that the partner hasn't been responsive to the author's needs. The author's frustration is justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to resolve a legitimate issue that affects their daily life. The partner's resistance might stem from not understanding the severity of the problem or not seeing the alternative solutions. But the author has the right to seek better sleep conditions.\n"
