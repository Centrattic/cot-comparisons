I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms due to their partner's loud snoring and TV habits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on having the TV on. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The author has been dealing with this for a long time and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nSo, the core issue is about sleep deprivation and the compromise between the couple. The author's main concern is getting rest, which is essential for health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, implying it's important for a couple to share a bed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, suggesting a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life doesn't seem unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep disruption, which can lead to health issues. The author has tried compromising (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. \n\nHowever, relationships require mutual effort and communication. Maybe the author could have discussed this earlier or tried other solutions first. But given the duration (8 years) and the fianc\u00e9's resistance to changing his habits, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction also seems to prioritize the couple's dynamic over the author's health. But in a marriage or long-term relationship, accommodating each other's needs is important. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make changes (like using earplugs, white noise machines, or a different sleeping arrangement), the author's decision to seek a solution that works for them is justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a legitimate issue that's affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on the TV and refusal to find a compromise might be the actual problem here.\n"
