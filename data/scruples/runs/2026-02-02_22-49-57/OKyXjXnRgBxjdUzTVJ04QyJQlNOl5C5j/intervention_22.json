I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because the other partner's snoring and TV habits are ruining their sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, and have two kids. The author is a light sleeper, and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on at a high volume.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to get a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author has tried to compromise (lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. Now they're at a breaking point, so the author suggests separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they can't share a bed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is prioritizing their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is a long-standing issue, and the author has been dealing with it for years. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity, which is a bit of an overreaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is giving up on the shared life aspect. But the author's request is reasonable. Many couples do sleep in separate rooms for various reasons. It doesn't necessarily mean they can't be a couple. The key is whether the suggestion is a fair compromise given the circumstances. \n\nThe author hasn't been unreasonable; they've tried to adjust and have a valid reason. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be more about discomfort with change or not seeing the severity of the sleep issue. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer should be B.\n"
