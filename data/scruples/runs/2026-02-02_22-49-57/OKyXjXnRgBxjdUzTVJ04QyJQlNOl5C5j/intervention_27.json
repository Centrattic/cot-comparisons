I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The context is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with a loud snore and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The author is a light sleeper and this has been an issue for years, even with kids involved.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted every night. Chronic lack of sleep can have serious health impacts, so it's understandable they're frustrated. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, seems to have a habit that's hard to break. He might not realize how his actions are affecting the author, especially since he sleeps through being told to lower the TV. The mention of kids adds another layer because the author is dealing with the stress of parenting while also dealing with poor sleep.\n\nThe author's solution is to sleep in a separate room. That's a drastic step, but maybe it's necessary. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is to see it as a relationship issue, thinking it's about being a couple versus roommates. But the core issue is a practical one: sleep and health. It's not about wanting to avoid the relationship but about needing to address a problem that's been ongoing for years.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being inconsiderate by suggesting a solution to a problem they've consistently faced. The fianc\u00e9's habits are contributing to the problem, and the author is trying to find a way to get the rest they need. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since they've already tried compromises (like lowering the TV volume a bit), but it's not working, the separate room might be a last resort. \n\nI think the author is justified in their request. The fianc\u00e9 might need to make more significant changes, but the author isn't in the wrong for suggesting a solution that could improve their quality of life. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
