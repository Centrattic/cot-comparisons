I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. They're a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy one who snores a lot and watches loud TV shows before bed. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if they turn it down, and this has been going on for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for a year, two kids. The user is exhausted and wants to sleep well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user's need for sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this. The user has tried compromising, like lowering the TV volume a little, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant because he thinks separate rooms mean they're just roommates, not a couple. But the user is prioritizing their health and the kids' well-being, maybe.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they're not being unreasonable. They've tried to accommodate the fianc\u00e9, but it's not working. Everyone has different needs. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 isn't considering the user's long-term health. The user is taking action to protect their own well-being, which is important. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems dismissive of the user's actual problem. So, probably the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
