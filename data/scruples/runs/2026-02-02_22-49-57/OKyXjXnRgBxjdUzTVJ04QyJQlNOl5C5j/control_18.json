I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The background is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches loud movies on the TV at night. The author is a light sleeper, so this is causing them to have bad sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1 with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks sleeping apart would make them just roommates, not a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making a reasonable request for a better night's sleep. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health and well-being, which is important. The author has tried compromising by turning down the volume, but it's not working. The key points here are the impact on the author's sleep and their relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that sharing a bed is a part of being a couple. But if the current situation is harmful to the author's health, maybe the priority should be on supporting each other's well-being. The author isn't suggesting not being a couple, just adjusting their living arrangement for their health needs. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author has tried to find a middle ground (lowering the volume), but it's not sufficient. The fianc\u00e9's habit is causing significant disruption. The author's request is about their own health, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to sleep in a separate room if that's the only way to get proper rest. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust his habits (like not watching loud movies at night) or maybe use earplugs or a white noise machine. The author's priority is their health, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
