I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper and her partner is a heavy snorer who watches TV loudly at night. They've been together for 8 years with two kids and have been engaged for a year. The fianc\u00e9 is tired of the bad sleep and wants to switch to separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9's request is about their own well-being and health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so wanting to address that is understandable. The partner's habit of keeping the TV on loudly and snoring is causing significant disruption. The fianc\u00e9 tried to compromise before, like lowering the volume, but it's not enough. The partner is now resistant, thinking it would make them more like roommates than a couple.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a typical AITA perspective, relationships often require compromise. However, in this case, the author is seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their health. The fianc\u00e9's actions are causing harm, and the request for separate rooms is a reasonable step if all other compromises have failed. The length of the relationship and the engagement with kids suggest this isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision but a long-term issue needing resolution.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Suggesting separate rooms might be seen as a last resort, but if the fianc\u00e9's health is at stake, it's a valid choice. The partner's resistance might come from not understanding the severity of the sleep issues. The author is not being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their well-being, which is essential. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
