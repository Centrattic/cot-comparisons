I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is engaged, has been together with their partner for 8 years, engaged for 1, and they have two kids. The main issue is sleep. The author is a light sleeper and needs a quiet room. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. Despite some compromise, the noise from the TV (with action movies full of loud sounds) is causing the author to have bad sleep every night. The author had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is against this, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the impact of the fianc\u00e9's habits on the author's well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, stress, and affect their ability to function. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, but the solution isn't working. The fianc\u00e9's side seems to be valuing the shared sleeping arrangement as a symbol of their relationship, but the author's health and comfort are at stake.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address a legitimate problem that's been ongoing for years. The fianc\u00e9 is not willing to adjust his habits enough to accommodate the author's needs. The author isn't just being selfish; they're seeking a solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life. Suggesting separate rooms is a practical solution when other compromises fail. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems to dismiss the author's valid need for rest, which is essential.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could explore other solutions before separate rooms, like earplugs, white noise machines, or a different TV setup. But given the context, the author has tried some adjustments already. The fianc\u00e9's sleep habits are extreme, and the author's health shouldn't be compromised. So, the answer is probably B\u2014author not in the wrong.\n"
