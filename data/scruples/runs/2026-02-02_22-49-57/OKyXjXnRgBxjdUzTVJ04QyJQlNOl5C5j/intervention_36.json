I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The context is a long-term engaged couple with kids. The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows at night, which disrupts the author's sleep. The author has tried to address the issue before but it's not working, so they suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid, especially with their health and well-being in mind. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so this isn't just a minor inconvenience. The fianc\u00e9's habits are clearly problematic here\u2014watching loud TV in bed and snoring loudly. The author has tried to compromise by asking him to lower the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response in his sleep to the volume being turned down shows he's not actively engaging in solving the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he sees separation as a major issue, implying that sharing a bed is essential for their relationship. But relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If one partner's needs are consistently ignored to the detriment of the other, it's a problem. The author has been dealing with this for years, which is a long time to endure discomfort. They have kids, so their well-being affects the whole family.\n\nI think the key points here are the author's legitimate need for rest, the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to adjust, and the duration of the problem. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're trying to find a solution that allows both to coexist, even if it means sleeping separately. The fianc\u00e9 is focusing on the symbolism of sharing a bed rather than the practical needs of the partner. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being in a long-term relationship. The right answer is B."
