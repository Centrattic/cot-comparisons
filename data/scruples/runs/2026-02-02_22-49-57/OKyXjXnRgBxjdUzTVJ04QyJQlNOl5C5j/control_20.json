I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a couple who's been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's sleep habits: he's a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise, leading to poor sleep. They tried compromising, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not right for couples to sleep separately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive, and he's not responsive to compromises. The author isn't suggesting a complete separation but just different rooms to get rest. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping apart undermines their relationship, viewing it as more like roommates. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are mutual respect and finding solutions. The author is trying to address a legitimate problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are contributing to the issue, and the author is seeking a reasonable solution. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable or that the fianc\u00e9's needs are being ignored\u2014except for the TV volume, which he's not willing to lower enough. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important, but so is individual well-being. If the couple can't find a middle ground, separate rooms might be a necessary solution. The author's request seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is also understandable from his perspective, but his unwillingness to adjust his habits might be part of the problem. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to solve a problem that's impacting their health and the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
