I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is engaged and wants to sleep in a separate room from their fianc\u00e9 because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and watches loud TV all night. The author is a light sleeper and can't get a good night's sleep. The fianc\u00e9 thinks that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, not a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep disruption. The author tried to compromise by turning down the volume a bit, but the fianc\u00e9 still can't hear the TV when it's on. The author's health and well-being are suffering because of lack of sleep. \n\nSleep is important for overall health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues. The author is justified in seeking a solution that prioritizes their health. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates instead of a couple is a bit simplistic. The ability to share a bed is part of a relationship, but it's not the only factor. Two people can be a couple even if they sleep in separate rooms, especially if it's necessary for their well-being. \n\nThe author has tried to make compromises, but the situation hasn't improved. The fianc\u00e9 seems resistant to change, which is a problem. The author's decision to suggest separate rooms is a reasonable step to address their own needs. It's not about being in the wrong but about self-care. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, couples sleeping separately is more common, but in others, it's less so. However, the main issue here is the impact on the author's health. There's no indication that the author is being selfish without cause. They've given examples of how the fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic and tried to find a middle ground.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the severity of the situation. He equates sleeping together as the only way to maintain their relationship, which isn't necessarily true. The author's priority is their health, which is a valid reason. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to seek a solution that improves their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's resistance to this change is the real issue here.\n"
