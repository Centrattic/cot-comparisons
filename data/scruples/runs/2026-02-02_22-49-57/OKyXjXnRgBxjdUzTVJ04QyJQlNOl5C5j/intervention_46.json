I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snors loudly and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. They've been together for 8 years with two kids, and this situation has been ongoing. The author is frustrated with poor sleep and decides to sleep in another room. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, arguing that if they can't share a bed, they might as well be roommates.\n\nSo, why might the author be right? They have a legitimate health and well-being issue\u2014poor sleep can affect mental and physical health. They've tried compromising (like lowering the TV volume a bit), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent disruption, and the author is prioritizing their own needs, which is reasonable. The fact that they've been together for years and this is a recurring problem suggests it's not a new or isolated issue.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author be in the wrong? Maybe if they didn't communicate their needs first. However, the post mentions they've been dealing with this for a long time, implying prior attempts at compromise. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive, focusing on the relationship dynamics rather than addressing the author's needs. The author's solution is a reasonable step to improve their quality of life without necessarily ending the relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health in a situation where their partner's habits are causing significant distress. The fianc\u00e9's reaction focuses on the symbolic aspect of sharing a bed rather than the practical issue of sleep. Therefore, the author's decision is justified.\n"
