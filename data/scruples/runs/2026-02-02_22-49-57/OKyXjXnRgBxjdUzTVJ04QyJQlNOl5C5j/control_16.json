I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV at high volume. The author has been dealing with this for a long time, and now they've had enough and suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a legitimate issue with their sleep being disrupted. Chronic lack of good sleep can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring and keeping the TV on\u2014seem to be causing the problem. The author tried to compromise, but it's not working. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is to argue that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But the author's main concern is their health and the long-term effects of poor sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. So this isn't a new issue. Maybe they've tried other solutions before, like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV volume, but those didn't work. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to have a good night's sleep is a basic need. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make adjustments that would allow both parties to sleep well, then the author's decision to seek a separate room might be necessary. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being just roommates seems dismissive of the author's genuine need. \n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. The author might have handled it better by discussing it more calmly before \"going psycho,\" but the underlying issue is real. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's quality of life. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to address a problem that's been ongoing. \n\nOn the other hand, sleeping in separate rooms might affect their relationship dynamics. But the author's health and well-being are important. If the fianc\u00e9 can't accommodate, then maybe separate rooms are a reasonable solution. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason and have tried to find a solution, but the fianc\u00e9's habits are the main issue.\n"
