I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person is engaged, has been with their fianc\u00e9 for 8 years, engaged for 1, and they have two kids. The main issue is sleep problems. The author is a light sleeper and needs a quiet, distraction-free environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on at a high volume, even though he sometimes lowers it a bit. The author tried to address this, but it's not working, leading them to suggest sleeping in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship as roommates, but the author just wants a good sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for sleep is crucial for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various issues, so this is a valid concern. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are deeply ingrained; he's a heavy sleeper and relies on the TV noise. His response in sleep when the volume is turned down shows he's not fully conscious of his actions. The author tried compromises, but it's not working anymore.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is seeking a solution to a legitimate problem. Suggesting separate rooms is a practical step when other solutions have failed. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed is a bit extreme. Marriage and partnerships require compromise, but when one's health is at stake, it's reasonable to adjust living arrangements. The author didn't just walk out; they tried to communicate and find a solution. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect of sharing a bed rather than the practical solution. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should consider each other's needs. However, when one's basic health needs aren't met, it's a valid reason to make changes. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, and the author is taking a step to mitigate that. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're seeking a solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life.\n"
