I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's a heavy sleeper and needs the TV on at a loud volume, while the author is a light sleeper struggling with sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is seeking a good night's sleep after years of dealing with the noise. They've tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9 argues that separate rooms would make them just roommates, which is a common argument against separate sleeping arrangements in relationships.\n\nBut there are factors to consider. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. Sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is affecting the author's well-being. The suggestion to sleep separately is to improve their own health and the relationship's overall dynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships often involve compromise. The author is making a significant change by suggesting a separate room, which might be seen as a last resort. However, if all other solutions have failed and the author's health is at stake, this could be justified.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a valid reason based on their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates might be more about clinging to tradition rather than addressing the actual issue. The key is whether the author has tried all possible solutions. Since they've mentioned some compromises and it's been a long time, the author's action seems reasonable. So, answer B.\n"
