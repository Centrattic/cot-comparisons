I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves differences in sleep habits. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle their fianc\u00e9's loud snoring and the TV volume. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, have two kids, and this has been going on a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to get a good night's sleep because their partner's habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV as a sleep aid, which is too loud. The author tried to compromise, but the issue persists. The author's frustration led them to suggest separate rooms. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 sees this as a problem in their relationship, implying that if they can't share a bed, maybe they shouldn't be a couple. That's a strong reaction. But is the author at fault? Well, their request is about their basic need for rest. Sleep is important for health, and chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences. The author has tried to communicate and compromise but it's not working. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's habits are also affecting the author's well-being. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 can't adjust the TV volume even when the author asks, and does so in his sleep, suggests that he's not fully considering the author's needs. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find solutions that work for both. If one party is consistently unhappy due to the other's habits and they can't find a middle ground, then it's reasonable to seek an alternative. The author is not being selfish; they're trying to improve their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be defensive and possibly not empathetic enough to the author's long-term struggles.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue that's been causing them distress for years. The answer should be B.\n"
