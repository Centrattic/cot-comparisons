I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully. The person is engaged and has been with their fianc\u00e9 for 8 years, engaged for a year, and has two kids. They're asking if they're the a**hole for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because of their partner's snoring and insistence on watching loud TV shows before bed.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and keeps the TV on at a high volume. The author says that every night, the fianc\u00e9 watches loud action movies, and turning down the volume causes him to wake up in his sleep. The author has been dealing with this for a long time and finally snapped, suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it means they might just be roommates if they can't share a bed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is justified in needing a good night's sleep, especially given the long-term relationship and the health implications of poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive, and the author has tried compromising (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume by a few points). However, the fianc\u00e9's behavior hasn't really changed, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author's suggestion to sleep separately is a last-resort solution after years of sleep deprivation. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the emotional aspect of not sharing a bed rather than addressing the actual issue of the author's need for quiet. The author's main point is about health and well-being, which is a valid concern. However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also valid in that sharing a bed is a common aspect of a romantic relationship.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing their health? Probably not. Sleep is important, and if the partner is unwilling to adjust (like using earplugs, white noise machines, or changing habits), then separate rooms might be a necessary solution. The author isn't suggesting never seeing each other again but just having separate sleeping arrangements for better rest. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it would make them \"just roommates\" seems a bit extreme, as couples can and do sleep separately for various reasons without diminishing their relationship.\n\nHowever, the abruptness of the author's approach\u2014going \"psycho\" and making a drastic suggestion without prior discussion\u2014might be a problem. Maybe they could have explored other solutions first, but given the time frame (8 years), it's possible they've already tried and failed. The author's frustration is understandable, and their need for sleep is legitimate.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason for wanting better sleep, and the fianc\u00e9's habits are contributing to the problem. The author isn't wrong for seeking a solution that prioritizes their well-being.\n"
