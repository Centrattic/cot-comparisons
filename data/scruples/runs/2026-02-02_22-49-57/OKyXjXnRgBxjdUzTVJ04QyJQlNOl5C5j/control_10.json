I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9's loud snoring and loud TV volume, which is affecting the author's sleep. They've been together for 8 years and have two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for a long time. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on. The author tried to compromise, but it's not working. They finally snapped and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's making them just roommates.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate need for rest. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting the author's quality of life. Suggesting separate rooms could be a reasonable solution if they can't find a mutual compromise. The author has tried to adjust (lowering the volume a bit) but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive of the author's needs, which is a problem. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They're advocating for their own well-being. The fianc\u00e9 might need to consider the author's needs more. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
