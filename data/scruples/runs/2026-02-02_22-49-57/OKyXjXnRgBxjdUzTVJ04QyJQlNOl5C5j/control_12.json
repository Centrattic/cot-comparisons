I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is engaged for 1 year and has been together for 8, with two kids. They mentioned being a light sleeper and preferring a quiet room. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on watching TV at half volume, which the author finds disturbing. The fianc\u00e9 even lowers the volume a bit sometimes, but still. The author had enough and suggested sleeping in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it's not romantic and they might as well be roommates. The author just wants a good sleep.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. The author tried to compromise, like turning down the volume, but that leads to arguments. Suggesting separate rooms seems like a solution to a real problem. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling it's not about being a couple anymore. \n\nAre there other factors? The relationship has been long-term. Maybe they haven't tried other solutions yet, like earplugs or white noise machines. The author says they've been dealing with this for a long time. So maybe sleeping separately is a reasonable step when other solutions aren't working. The fianc\u00e9's snoring is a medical issue? Maybe he should see a doctor. The TV volume at half might still be too loud for a light sleeper. \n\nThe author is not wrong for prioritizing their health. Relationships require compromise, but that shouldn't mean one person's health is sacrificed. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive of the author's needs. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no other angle where the author is overreacting. But the situation has been ongoing for years, and the author tried to find solutions. Separate rooms might be a common solution for couples with incompatible sleeping habits. So yes, the author is justified.\n"
