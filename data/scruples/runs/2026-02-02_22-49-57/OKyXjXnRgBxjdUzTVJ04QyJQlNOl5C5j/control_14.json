I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that they're engaged, have two kids, and have been together for 8 years. The author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and likes to watch TV at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear if the TV is too low, even in sleep. The author is tired of the bad sleep and suggested separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it's just like being roommates.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to their partner's habits. The fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic: heavy snoring, TV at high volume, which the author finds disruptive. The author has been dealing with this for a long time (8 years together, 1 year engaged). The fianc\u00e9's argument is that sleeping separately would make them just like roommates, not a couple. \n\nNow, considering typical relationship advice, communication and compromise are key. The author has tried to address this, maybe with some compromises (lowering the TV a bit), but it's not working. The author is seeking a solution to their personal well-being by suggesting separate rooms. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that this is a rejection of the relationship. \n\nBut the author's health and well-being are important. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and relationships. If the author's request is reasonable (to sleep in a separate room to get rest) and the partner isn't able to accommodate, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. However, maybe the author could explore other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or medical help for the snoring (like a CPAP machine). \n\nBut the author says they've tried some things and it's been a long issue. So if all else fails, the author's request for separate rooms is about their own needs, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be seen as not considering the author's well-being. So in this case, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried more solutions before splitting up. However, the author mentions they've been dealing with this for a long time. In that case, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. But some might argue that the author could have tried more compromises. But given the description, the author has tried some compromise (lowering the TV by 3 points, but it's not enough). The fianc\u00e9 is resistant to change, so the author is taking a step to protect their own health. \n\nIn that case, the author is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
