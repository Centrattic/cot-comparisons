I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about suggesting to sleep in separate rooms because of differing sleep needs. The author is a light sleeper, while their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and needs the TV on loudly. They've been together for 8 years with two kids, and the fianc\u00e9 is resistant to the idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being consistently disrupted, which can lead to health issues over time. Chronic lack of sleep is a legitimate problem. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring loudly and needing the TV on\u2014are significant contributors. The author has tried compromising by letting him lower the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response that sleeping separately would make them just roommates seems dismissive of the author's well-being. \n\nHowever, relationships often involve compromise. The author is considering a drastic step. Maybe there are other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or even medical advice for the snoring. But the author has already tried some compromises. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to prioritize the relationship dynamic over the author's health needs. \n\nCouples often find ways to coexist despite differences, but when one's health is at stake, it's a valid concern. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not realizing the impact of his habits. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their health. Since the author has tried some compromises and the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust further, suggesting separate rooms isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
