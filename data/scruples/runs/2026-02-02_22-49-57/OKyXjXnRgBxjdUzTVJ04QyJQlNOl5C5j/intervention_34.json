I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author suggested sleeping in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and it's affecting the author's sleep. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, which adds context about the long-term nature of the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper and has tried to cope for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant sleep disruption. Sleeping in separate rooms could be a reasonable solution to improve the author's quality of life. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, seeing it as a step towards being roommates instead of a couple. \n\nBut the author's main point is about needing their own space for rest. Chronic sleep issues can have health impacts, so this isn't just about being picky. The fianc\u00e9's willingness to compromise has been minimal, only lowering the volume slightly. The author's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling criticized, but the author's need for sleep is valid. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate need and have endured the problem for years. Suggesting separate rooms is a practical solution to a persistent issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the emotional aspect, but the author's health and well-being are important too.\n"
