I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about sleeping arrangements. The fianc\u00e9 wants to sleep in separate rooms because her partner is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies on the TV, and she's a light sleeper. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions are justified. She's a light sleeper, which is a valid issue. The partner's habits\u2014snoring loudly, leaving the TV on at a high volume\u2014are affecting her sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can have health impacts, so this isn't trivial.\n\nThe partner's response is to call it a terrible idea, implying that separate rooms would make them just roommates. But the author wants to maintain the relationship but have her needs met. The question is whether she's wrong to prioritize her well-being. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author tried to compromise (the partner lowers the volume slightly), but it's not enough. After 8 years, this ongoing issue might indicate a lack of resolution. Suggesting separate rooms could be a reasonable solution to address her needs without ending the relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they can't share a bed and thus might as well be roommates seems to overlook the fact that they already have separate needs. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like a different room setup for her to sleep. \n\nIs she wrong? Probably not. Her health and well-being matter. Relationships require flexibility. If he's unwilling to adjust further, maybe the problem lies in his refusal to accommodate her needs. The author's action is about self-care. So, answer B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
