I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The person is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the author to have bad sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is their own sleep quality, which is essential for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so this is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might be using the TV to help him fall asleep, which he might not be able to do without. This could be due to anxiety or other factors. However, he's willing to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but not enough to accommodate the author's needs.\n\nThe author has been dealing with this for years, which suggests that previous attempts to resolve the issue haven't worked. The compromise of lowering the volume by 3 points isn't sufficient. The author's decision to sleep separately is a drastic step, but given the long-term problem and their health, it might be justified. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to focus on the symbolic aspect of the relationship, implying that separate rooms undermine the couple's commitment. But the author's priority is their own well-being, which is understandable.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, sharing a room is seen as essential for a marriage or engagement, but health issues can override these norms. The author's decision is about their quality of life and their ability to function properly. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make further adjustments, the author's choice to prioritize their sleep isn't unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author has tried to communicate their needs and the compromise offered isn't working. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to dismiss the author's valid health concerns, focusing instead on the relationship's symbolism. This could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding on the fianc\u00e9's part.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's request for separate rooms is a reasonable step given the circumstances. They're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, while emotional, doesn't invalidate the author's needs. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
