I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper, using the TV loudly at night, and causing the author to lose sleep. The author is a light sleeper, so this is a big problem for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. They have two kids, so sleep deprivation can affect their health and ability to care for the children. The fianc\u00e9's behavior seems habitual\u2014he can't hear the TV unless it's at a high volume, even when asleep, and he doesn't adjust it much. The author is at their breaking point, leading them to suggest separate rooms.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, which is a valid concern in a relationship. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is trying to solve a legitimate problem that's been ongoing. They've tried to compromise (like lowering the volume a bit) but it's not enough. Sleep is crucial for health, and chronic sleep issues can lead to bigger problems. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's well-being. Suggesting separate rooms is a practical solution to ensure the author can rest, especially with two kids to care for. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the symbolism of separate rooms rather than the practicality of the author's need for sleep. \n\nSo, the author isn't being unreasonable here. They have a valid reason based on their health and the long-term strain of this issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
