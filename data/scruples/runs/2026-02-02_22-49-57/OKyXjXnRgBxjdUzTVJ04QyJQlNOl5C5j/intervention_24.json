I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV at night, which is disturbing their sleep. They've been together a long time with kids, so this has been going on for a while.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper and it's affecting their well-being. Chronic sleep issues can really impact health and relationships. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that this is a significant change that affects the intimacy of their relationship. He's trying to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but not enough to help the author.\n\nThe author's main point is about their health and the need for rest. It's reasonable to want a good night's sleep. The fianc\u00e9's argument about the relationship's purpose is a bit extreme. Just because they aren't sharing a bed doesn't mean they aren't a couple. Roommates can still have a committed relationship. However, it's important that both partners feel heard and that the solution is fair.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9 should also be open to finding a compromise. Maybe there are other solutions like earplugs, white noise machines, or a different TV setup. But suggesting separate rooms isn't unreasonable if other options fail. So the answer is B.\n"
