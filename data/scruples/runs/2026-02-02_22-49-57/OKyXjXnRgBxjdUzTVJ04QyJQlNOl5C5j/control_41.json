I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies, and keeps the TV on. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the scenario. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years plus a year of engagement, with two kids. They've tried some compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume by 3 points sometimes. But the problem persists every night. The author finally snaps and suggests separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, saying it's not worth being a couple if they can't share a bed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a basic perspective, people have different sleeping needs. The author has a legitimate issue with sleep quality, which is important for health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. While it's true that couples usually share a bed, the author is prioritizing their well-being. They're not saying they don't want to be together, just that they need their own space for rest. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed might be a bit extreme. The author's request is about a separate room, not breaking up. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should have tried more solutions first. But they mentioned they have tried some compromises. Also, the fianc\u00e9's sleep habits are extreme (TV on loudly, loud snoring). It's not just a minor issue. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about the principle than the solution. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to resolve a long-standing issue that affects their health and happiness. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
