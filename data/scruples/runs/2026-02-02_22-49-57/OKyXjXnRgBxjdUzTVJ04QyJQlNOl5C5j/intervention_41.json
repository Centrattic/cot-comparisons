I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is that the author is a light sleeper, while the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and a loud snorer. He also insists on leaving the TV on at a high volume, which the author can't stand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years and is now engaged with two kids. Their request seems to stem from a genuine need for better sleep. Chronic poor sleep can affect health and well-being, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might have his own reasons for needing the TV on. Maybe it's a habit for falling asleep, or he finds it comforting. But he's a heavy sleeper and doesn't notice the noise, which makes it hard to compromise.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the idea of being roommates instead of a couple. That's a bit of a red flag because it frames the situation as a failure of the relationship rather than a need for a practical solution. However, the author's approach might have come off as abrupt. Instead of \"going psycho and telling him from now on,\" maybe a more calm and collaborative approach would have been better. But the author's frustration is understandable after so long.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health. Sleeping in separate rooms isn't uncommon in some relationships where there are significant differences in sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9's inflexibility might be the issue here. The author did mention some compromise from the fianc\u00e9 (lowering the volume a bit), but it's not enough. The question is whether suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution. Since the author has a legitimate need and the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust, it's a valid step. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
