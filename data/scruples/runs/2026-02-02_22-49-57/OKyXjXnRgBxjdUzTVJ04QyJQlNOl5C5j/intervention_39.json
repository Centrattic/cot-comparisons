I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to change the volume much and the author can't take it anymore.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might not realize how his actions impact the author. He might be used to the TV noise and not see it as a problem. \n\nThe author has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together and engaged for a year. That's a significant duration. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the significance of sharing a room as a couple versus roommates. But the author's prioritization of their health and the kids' well-being could be valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to ask for compromises before, and the fianc\u00e9 wasn't making significant changes. When the author suggested separate rooms, the fianc\u00e9 reacted emotionally. Maybe he didn't consider the long-term effects on the author's health. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a legitimate need for rest, and their solution is a reasonable step to address a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional aspect of not sharing a room rather than the author's genuine health concerns. So, the answer should be B.\n"
