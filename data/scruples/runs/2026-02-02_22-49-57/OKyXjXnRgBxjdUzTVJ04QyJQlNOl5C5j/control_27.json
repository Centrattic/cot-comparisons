I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a light sleeper, wants a quiet room, but their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and insists on having the TV on. The fianc\u00e9 even says he can't hear the TV if it's turned down, waking up in his sleep. The author is fed up and wants to sleep separately. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, saying if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, and have two kids. The author feels like they've dealt with this for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption to the author's sleep. Chronic lack of sleep can lead to health issues, so that's a big deal. The author has tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's behavior seems selfish, as he's not considering the author's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, so maybe he's unaware of how loud the TV is while sleeping. But the author mentions that every night he puts on action movies with loud sounds, which suggests it's a consistent choice and not just an occasional thing. The author's main issue is the noise, which is affecting them both, but the fianc\u00e9 is the one causing it. \n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship with two kids, so separating rooms might be a practical solution to maintain their relationship's stability. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit flippant. The core problem is the author's need for rest, which is valid. \n\nI think the author is justified in wanting to improve their sleep. It's not about avoiding the relationship but about health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9 should be more considerate. So the answer is B.\n"
