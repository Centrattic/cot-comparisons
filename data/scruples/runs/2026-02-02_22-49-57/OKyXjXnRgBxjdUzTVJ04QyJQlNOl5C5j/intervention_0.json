I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and snores a lot, and he likes to watch TV with high volume. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise, leading to sleepless nights. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9's response is that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's action is justified. Sleeping in separate rooms is a common solution for couples with incompatible sleep habits. The author is seeking a basic need\u2014restful sleep\u2014which is important for their well-being and ability to function. The fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic and not just minor annoyances. He's described as a heavy sleeper who can't hear the author's complaints unless she turns down the volume, but when she does, he wakes up and argues in his sleep. This seems like a long-standing issue that's not being resolved through communication or compromise.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that not sharing a bed would make them just roommates. However, relationships can involve compromises beyond just sharing a bed. The author's suggestion is about addressing their specific need for a good night's sleep, which is essential. It's not necessarily about wanting to avoid their partner but about creating a better living situation for both. The author has tried compromises before, like lowering the volume by 3 points, but it's not enough. They've been dealing with this for years, so the situation might be unsustainable if there's no solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's need to have the TV on is part of his sleep routine. But it's unreasonable if it's causing significant distress to the other person. The key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate or if they have a legitimate reason. Since they've tried to communicate and compromise, and the problem persists, suggesting separate rooms seems a reasonable step to prioritize their health and the relationship in the long run.\n\nThe fact that they have kids might add another layer. Good sleep is crucial for parenting. The author's frustration after 8 years is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is also normal, but it's important to find a middle ground. Maybe they can try other solutions first, like soundproofing, earplugs, or a white noise machine. But if those don't work, separate rooms could be a valid option.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're addressing their significant sleep issues, which affect their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's needs are important, but the author's right to rest is equally valid. The answer should be B (No).\n"
