I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV with high volume while sleeping. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, have two kids. The author is fed up with the bad sleep and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks it's a bad idea.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess the situation. The author has a legitimate need for quiet to sleep. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. Sleeping in separate rooms is a proposed solution to a real problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity, which might be a bit extreme. The author has been putting up with this for a long time, so it's not an impulsive decision. \n\nThe key points are: the author is dealing with chronic sleep issues, which can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9 isn't making sufficient accommodations. The author is seeking a solution that prioritizes their own well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's better to be roommates seems to misunderstand the issue; separate rooms don't have to mean the end of the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being unreasonable. They've tried to compromise (the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a bit), but it's not enough. The author is asserting their needs after years of struggle. So, I think the author is in the right, answer B."
