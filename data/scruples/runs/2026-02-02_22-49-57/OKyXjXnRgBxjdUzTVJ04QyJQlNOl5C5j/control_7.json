I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is a light sleeper, wants to sleep in a separate room from their fianc\u00e9 because he's a heavy sleeper, snores a lot, and insists on having the TV on at a loud volume. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is unhappy with the suggestion, thinking it's not a good idea because then they might as well be roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep problems can affect health and well-being, so it's a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own sleeping preferences: he needs the TV on for sleep and is a heavy sleeper. He might not be aware of how disruptive his habits are, or maybe he's tried to compromise by lowering the volume sometimes.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't mind the TV and even says he can't hear it when they turn it down. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which suggests it's a long-standing issue. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to not take into account the health impact on the author. Maybe they haven't discussed the problem enough or tried other solutions first. However, the author's reaction of going \"crazy\" and suggesting a separate room immediately might be seen as extreme, especially without first exploring alternatives like a white noise machine, earplugs, or maybe even both sleeping in separate rooms temporarily. The fianc\u00e9 also points out the relationship aspect\u2014sleeping apart could affect their connection. But the author's need for proper sleep is significant. \n\nIn many relationships, especially with kids and a long engagement, practical considerations can override some romantic ones. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make a significant change (like getting treatment for snoring or finding a different way to sleep), the author has a right to prioritize their health. The answer likely depends on whether other solutions were attempted before this suggestion. Since the author hasn't mentioned trying other methods, maybe they're jumping to a drastic conclusion. But since the fianc\u00e9 isn't budging, and the author's health is suffering, the author might be justified. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a valid reason, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't being considerate. The answer might be B (No).\n"
