I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who suggested sleeping in separate rooms is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies with the TV on, and the author is a light sleeper who can't get rest because of it. They've been dealing with this for a long time, and the author finally snapped and suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's position is that they need a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. They've tried to compromise before, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, argues that if they can't share a bed, there's no point in being a couple instead of roommates. That's a bit harsh, but maybe he feels that the author is giving up on their relationship.\n\nBut the author has been putting up with this for 8 years with two kids. It's not just a recent issue. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing chronic sleep deprivation, which can have health impacts. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which might seem extreme, but if other compromises have failed, maybe it's reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's response seems dismissive of the author's needs, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the problem, the attempts at compromise, and the severity of the issue. The author isn't making a snap decision but has tried to adapt as much as possible. The fianc\u00e9's suggestion that separate rooms would make them just roommates ignores the fact that couples often have different sleeping arrangements for various reasons, like snoring or work shifts. It's not about the relationship's validity but about mutual respect and finding a solution that works for both.\n\nIn similar scenarios, people often suggest separate rooms as a practical solution when other options fail. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about his own discomfort than the author's justified need for sleep. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
