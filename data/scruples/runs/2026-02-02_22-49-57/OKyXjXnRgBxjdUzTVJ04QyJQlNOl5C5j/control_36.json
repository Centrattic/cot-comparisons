I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly at night. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the author to have poor sleep, and after years of this, the author is suggesting separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their health and well-being, needing good sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious effects, so this is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might be used to his habits and sees them as necessary for his own sleep, perhaps due to personal preference or even something like insomnia.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being together. That's a bit of a loaded statement. Marriage and relationships involve compromise. However, the author's need for restful sleep is a significant health issue. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing long-term harm to the author's health, which might outweigh the desire to share a bedroom.\n\nThe author tried to compromise by asking the fianc\u00e9 to lower the volume some, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response suggests he's not willing to make changes, leading the author to take a drastic step. The author isn't suggesting never seeing the fianc\u00e9 again, just separate rooms. That could still maintain their relationship but address the sleep issue.\n\nBut is there a middle ground? Maybe using earplugs, white noise machines, or other solutions. However, the author might have tried those without success. The fianc\u00e9's resistance to change might be the core issue here. If he's unwilling to find solutions, the author is left with limited options.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is acting in their own health interest. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting the author's well-being, and the author is seeking a resolution. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates seems dismissive of the author's legitimate need. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
