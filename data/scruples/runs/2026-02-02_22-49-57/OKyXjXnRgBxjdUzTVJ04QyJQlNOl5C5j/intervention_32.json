I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms due to differing sleep habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author is a light sleeper who can't stand noise, while the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who requires loud TV volume and snores loudly. They've been together for 8 years and engaged for 1 year, with two kids. The author has been dealing with this for a long time and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, then being a couple is pointless, implying that this is a deal-breaker. But the author's main issue is getting sufficient rest, which is important for health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's behavior (sleeping with the TV on loudly and snoring) seems to be the root cause here. The author has tried some compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough.\n\nNow, considering typical AITA scenarios, the key points are whether the author acted unreasonably. The author's request is about personal well-being and health. It's understandable that chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and the author is seeking a solution. Suggesting separate rooms isn't uncommon in some relationships when there are significant incompatibilities that affect health. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected, not the actual issue. The author isn't ending the relationship; they're just adjusting living arrangements to get rest. The fianc\u00e9 might need to consider that the author's request is reasonable and necessary for their health. However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that sharing a bed is essential for a romantic relationship. \n\nIn many cases, people prioritize their health and have separate rooms without it being the end of a relationship. So, the author's action is a valid request for self-care. The fianc\u00e9 needs to find a way to address their own sleep needs without compromising the partner's well-being. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's priority is their health, which is valid, and they've tried compromises. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be more about his own feelings about the relationship dynamics than the actual issue of separate sleeping arrangements.\n"
