I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. The main issues here are the fianc\u00e9's heavy snoring and the TV volume. The writer is a light sleeper, so this is causing them a lot of stress and bad sleep over 8 years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer has a valid reason\u2014they need rest, which is important for health and well-being. They've been dealing with this for a long time, which shows it's a recurring problem. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, claims he can't sleep without the TV on, even if it's loud. He might have his own reasons, maybe anxiety or something else, but he's not compromising effectively.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The writer tried to find a solution but reached a breaking point. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about the relationship's commitment, but the writer is focused on their basic need for sleep. Separating rooms could be a temporary solution to improve well-being. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or like the relationship is ending. \n\nI should check if there are other possible solutions. Maybe using earplugs, white noise machines, or a sleep mask. But the writer might have tried these already. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 says he can't hear the TV if it's turned down, even in sleep, suggests he's resistant to compromise. The writer's decision is about self-care after years of poor sleep. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make sacrifices. But when one's health is at stake, the other's habits need adjustment. The writer isn't wrong for prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates might be a misunderstanding of the issue. The writer's request isn't about the relationship but about personal health. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're addressing a legitimate problem that's been unresolved for a long time, and seeking a solution (even if it's separate rooms) is reasonable.\n"
