I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV before bed, which is disturbing the author's sleep. They've been together for a long time and have kids. The fianc\u00e9 is against the idea, thinking it's not a good idea for a couple to sleep separately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is a light sleeper, so their sleep is being affected every night. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. It's been 8 years, so this is a long-term issue. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and the author is at their breaking point. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 sees sleeping separately as equivalent to being roommates, which might feel like a step back in their relationship. But the author is not suggesting a breakup; they still want to be a couple, just with separate rooms for better rest. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise. The fianc\u00e9's habits are negatively impacting the author's well-being. If they can't find a middle ground, the author has the right to prioritize their health. Suggesting separate rooms might be a last resort if all other options have been exhausted. \n\nI don't see the author being in the wrong here. They've tried to compromise (like lowering the TV volume a bit), but it's not enough. The author's need for rest is valid, and it's reasonable to seek a solution that benefits both parties. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the symbolic aspect of sleeping together versus the practical need for sleep. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
