I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms due to sleep issues. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches loud TV shows every night. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for 8 years, leading to poor sleep. They have two kids and are engaged. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the problem and says if they can't share a bed, why be a couple. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are the sleep deprivation, the fianc\u00e9's behavior, and the suggestion to sleep separately. The author is seeking a solution to a problem that's been ongoing. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author is trying to address their needs, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive, which might indicate he hasn't been considerate of the author's well-being. Suggesting separate rooms is a drastic step but might be necessary if other solutions have failed. The author's motivation is self-care and health, which is valid. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider if there were prior attempts to resolve the issue. The author mentions the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume slightly, but it's not enough. The author's frustration is justified after years of this. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being a couple vs. roommates is a bit extreme, as relationships can adapt. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They're not wrong for prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is problematic. The author isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
