I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because of their different sleep habits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The author can't sleep because of the noise, and even when the TV is turned down, the fianc\u00e9 seems to adjust it in his sleep. They've been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for a year, two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not right because they could just be roommates.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main issue is the inability to get a good night's sleep, which affects their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are objectively causing a problem. The author has tried to compromise by lowering the TV volume, but it's not enough. The stress of this has built up over years, leading to the suggestion of separate rooms. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, which is a valid emotional concern. Relationships often involve shared spaces, and the idea of separate rooms might feel like a step back from that. But is the author at fault for prioritizing their health? Sleep is important, and chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences. The author has tried to find a solution but is at their limit.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's habits are not something they can easily change, but maybe there are other solutions they haven't considered. For example, using earplugs, a white noise machine, or addressing the snoring (like seeing a doctor). But the author has mentioned that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't respond well to compromises. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author did bring it up after trying to adjust, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant. So the author's action is a last resort. The question is whether suggesting separate rooms is unreasonable. In some cases, couples do sleep in separate rooms for various reasons, and it can work if both agree. However, the fianc\u00e9 is clearly upset, which might indicate that this is a deal-breaker for him. \n\nBut the author's well-being is a valid concern. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make changes that would allow the author to sleep, the author has a right to seek a solution. However, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't give more time to try other solutions or if they didn't consider the emotional impact on the relationship. \n\nIn the AITA context, the answer often depends on whether the action taken was justified. The author's intention is to improve their own quality of life, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the relationship, but the author's health is also important. It's a tough call, but I think the author is not in the wrong because their action is a response to a long-standing, unresolved issue that affects their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause, and the author is seeking a necessary change."
