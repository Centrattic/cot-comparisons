I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The background is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV before bed. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, engaged for 1, and have two kids. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees and thinks it's not a good idea.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's request is reasonable. The main issue here is sleep disturbance. The author is a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting their rest. Chronic lack of sleep can have serious health implications. The fianc\u00e9's behavior includes loud TV and snoring, which are clear disruptions. The author has tried to compromise before, like turning it down, but it hasn't worked. Now they're suggesting separate rooms to get a good night's sleep.\n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation that couples should always share a bed? In Western cultures, it's common but not a rule. The article I read earlier mentioned that in some situations, like long-term issues with sleep, separate rooms can be a solution. The author's well-being is a factor here. If one partner's habits are causing significant harm to the other's health, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit extreme, as roommates also might have different sleep needs but typically find a compromise.\n\nAlso, the engagement and kids part. They have a long-term commitment and family, so the author's need for a good sleep is important for their overall family life. The fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to adjust might indicate a lack of consideration. The author tried to lower the volume by three points, but maybe that's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's sleep habits are so extreme that it's causing real suffering.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's legitimate need for sleep, the fianc\u00e9's inconsiderate behavior, the long-term nature of the problem, and the lack of effective compromise. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to address a real issue. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
