I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV at a high volume, which disrupts the author's sleep. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the issue, and the author is frustrated after 8 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's main issue is not getting enough sleep because of their partner's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's well-being. The author has tried compromising, but it's not working. They've been through this for a long time, which adds to the stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting or that the relationship is being taken for granted by suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9's response about roommates is a bit extreme, but it's a common argument in these situations. However, the fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the problem, so the blame isn't entirely on the author.\n\nThe author's request for a separate room is a solution to a legitimate problem. It's their right to seek a solution for their health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here. While the author could have approached it differently, the underlying issue is the fianc\u00e9's behavior. The author isn't wrong for wanting to improve their sleep, especially after enduring it for so long.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are a response to a significant and ongoing issue affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the main problem, not the author's suggestion.\n"
