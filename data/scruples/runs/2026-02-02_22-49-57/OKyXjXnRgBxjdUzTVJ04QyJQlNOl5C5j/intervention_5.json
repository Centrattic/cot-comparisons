I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV shows before bed. The author can't sleep properly and has finally had enough, so they suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's weird for a couple to not share a room. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. They've been together eight years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The author has been dealing with this for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent sleep issues. The author's health and well-being are important. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious effects. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is described as not flexible\u2014he compromises sometimes but not enough. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which is a reasonable step to improve their quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that sharing a room is a norm for couples. But norms can vary. Some couples do live in separate rooms for various reasons. The key here is whether the author acted unreasonably. The author's request is for their own well-being, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause. The author is not being selfish; they need rest. The fianc\u00e9 not adjusting his behavior (like turning down the TV more, using earplugs, or using a white noise machine) is a problem. The author's decision to set a boundary is understandable. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
