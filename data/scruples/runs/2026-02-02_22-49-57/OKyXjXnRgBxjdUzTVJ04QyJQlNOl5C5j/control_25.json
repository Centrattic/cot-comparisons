I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV loudly at night. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing the author to have bad sleep every night. They tried to adjust, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's still a problem. The author finally suggested separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship. They've been together a long time with kids, so this is a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep, which is a legitimate health concern. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so it's a valid reason to seek a solution. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and he's not really making an effort to change. He's a heavy sleeper, but the fact that he's watching TV at half volume and can't hear it if it's turned down suggests he's not being considerate of the author's needs. Also, the author mentions that when they do turn it down, the fianc\u00e9 wakes up and complains in his sleep, which shows he's not aware of the impact on the author.\n\nThe author has been dealing with this for years, which is a long time to put up with something that's affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's response is to question the relationship, which seems a bit extreme. If he were in a healthy relationship, he would be more understanding and willing to find compromises. The fact that they have kids together might mean that they need to work this out for the kids' sake as well, but that's more about their relationship dynamics than who's right here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, suggesting separate rooms is a practical solution to a problem that the fianc\u00e9 isn't addressing. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They've tried to compromise, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the emotional aspect of the relationship rather than the practical issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to seek a better sleeping arrangement. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, isn't making sufficient efforts to accommodate the author's needs. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
