I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe person is engaged to their partner, and they've been together for 8 years with two kids. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and insists on having the TV on at a volume that's too loud for the author. The author is a light sleeper and can't get a good night's sleep because of this. After years of this, they suggested moving to separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he thinks sharing a bed is important for their relationship. The author just wants to sleep well.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author has been dealing with sleep issues for a long time\u20148 years. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author is exhausted and finally snapped, suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is emotional, saying it would make them just roommates. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication and mutual respect are important. The fianc\u00e9's TV habits are affecting the author's health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health consequences. The author is looking for a solution to a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might be resistant to change and not fully appreciating the impact of his actions. \n\nThe question is whether the author's suggestion is unreasonable. The author isn't asking for the TV to be completely off, just a volume that allows both to sleep. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on the TV might be a personal need (maybe he can't sleep without it), but it's conflicting with the author's needs. In a long-term relationship, partners usually need to find compromises. However, when one partner's needs are consistently unmet and affecting their health, it's reasonable to seek a solution. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they'd just be roommates if they don't share a bed is a bit extreme. While sharing a bed is a common part of a relationship, it's not the only way to maintain a close relationship. Some couples choose separate beds for various reasons, including health issues. The author's main goal is to get a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. \n\nTherefore, it seems the author is not in the wrong. They've tried to adjust and compromise, but the situation has become untenable. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more considerate of the author's well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
