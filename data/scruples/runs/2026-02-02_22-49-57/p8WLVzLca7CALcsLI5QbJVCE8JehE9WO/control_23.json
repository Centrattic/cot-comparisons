Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She told their boss months in advance to keep it a secret. The author is upset because she didn't consult him, used their mutual boss to secure time off, and he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep instead of travel. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't know about the trip until it was all set, and she went behind his back to get approval from their boss. Even though she paid for it, he didn't agree to the plan. Using company resources (their boss) without his input might be a problem, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. \n\nThe author's main issue is that she didn't ask first. He values his leave time for resting, not traveling. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she put effort into planning something nice. But the author isn't wrong for not wanting to go against his wishes. She should have discussed it with him first. \n\nThe friends say he's ungrateful, but that's maybe not considering his perspective. The author's right to have his preferences respected is important. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping by making a significant decision without his input. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend didn't consult him, and he's justified in wanting to use his leave as he prefers.\n"
