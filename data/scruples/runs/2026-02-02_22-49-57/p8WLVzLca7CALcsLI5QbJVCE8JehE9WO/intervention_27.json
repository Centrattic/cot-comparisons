Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She used their mutual boss to get leave approved. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he prefers not to travel overseas during his leave. He also mentions concerns about professionalism, as using leave for a couples' trip could be unprofessional, especially since they report to the same boss.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, so I need to evaluate if that's the case. Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but she didn't check with him. The author has a valid point about not wanting to use his leave for travel and the unprofessional aspect of coordinating leave through their boss without his input. However, the girlfriend might feel she was planning a surprise, and he's rejecting her gesture, which could be seen as ungrateful.\n\nBut the core issue is consent and communication. The author's right to decide how to use his leave is important. The girlfriend's action was a surprise, but not discussing it first means she didn't respect his autonomy. The author's refusal is about personal preference and professionalism, which are legitimate reasons. The friends' advice that he's ungrateful might not account for his valid concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing by his own preferences and the unprofessional arrangement. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first.\n"
