Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland. She didn't consult the author, just gave him the tickets. She had already talked to their boss months ahead to get leave, which the author finds unprofessional. The key points here are about consent, communication, and professional boundaries.\n\nThe author's main issues are twofold. First, the girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to go on the trip. Personal preferences matter here\u2014he mentions he'd prefer to relax and sleep, not travel overseas. Second, the girlfriend used their mutual boss to arrange the leave without his input, which he sees as a risk to his career and unprofessional. The fact that they report to the same boss adds a layer of potential workplace complications if the arrangement isn't appropriate.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's intentions: She wanted to do something nice for his birthday. However, the method involved making major decisions without his knowledge. Even if the trip is a surprise, the lack of communication is a problem. The author's right to autonomy in deciding how to use his vacation time is important. Vacation leave is personal, so having it allocated without consent could be an issue.\n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude isn't about accepting something you didn't ask for. The core issue is whether the girlfriend overstepped by not seeking his input on a decision that affects him directly. The author's refusal isn't about rejecting the gesture itself but about the process and lack of communication.\n\nWorkplace implications: Using a shared boss to arrange leave might be unprofessional if it's not standard procedure. The author is concerned about career risks, which is valid. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as crossing professional boundaries, especially if their boss isn't supposed to coordinate such things for employees. This could reflect poorly on both of them if discovered.\n\nCancellation fees aren't the author's responsibility. He's not in the wrong for not wanting to go, especially since he didn't agree to the trip. The girlfriend's frustration might be because she wanted a romantic gesture, but the author's right to control his own schedule and work decisions is paramount here.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is key. The girlfriend's approach was to make a big decision without discussion. The author's choice to decline isn't about being ungrateful but about asserting his own preferences and concerns about professionalism. So, he's not in the wrong for standing up for his boundaries.\n"
