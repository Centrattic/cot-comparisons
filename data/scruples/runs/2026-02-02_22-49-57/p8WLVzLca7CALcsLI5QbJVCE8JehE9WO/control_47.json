Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend arranged a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and told the boss in advance without consulting the author. The author is upset because they didn't agree to use their leave for that trip, and they don't want to travel overseas. They also think it's unprofessional for the girlfriend to talk to their boss without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend used the author's leave without his consent. Even though she might have done it to plan something nice, she didn't get his input. The author's main issue is that he wasn't asked if he wanted to go. That's a big deal because it's about respecting his autonomy and preferences. Also, using company leave without discussion could lead to professional problems, which the author is concerned about.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to make it a surprise, which is a common way people do gifts. She might have thought it was a generous gesture. But the problem is that she went ahead without considering his preferences. The author's friends say he's ungrateful, but I think the main issue is lack of communication. The author has valid reasons to be upset because his consent wasn't sought. So, is he wrong for refusing?\n\nI think the key here is whether the girlfriend should have asked first. Since she didn't, and the author now has a legitimate reason to refuse, he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
