Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a trip to Switzerland for his birthday. She took the initiative by talking to their boss in advance to arrange the leave. The author is upset that she didn't ask him first and that she used company leave for an overseas trip, which he thinks is unprofessional. Also, he prefers to relax and sleep during his time off instead of traveling.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend did make a surprise, which isn't inherently wrong, but she went ahead and made plans without consulting him. The author feels that she should have asked because he doesn't want to travel overseas and is concerned about the professional implications. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might see this as a thoughtful gift, planning something exciting for his birthday. But the author's main issue is that his preferences were overlooked. He's worried about how taking leave might affect his career, which is a valid concern. Also, using company leave for a trip that he didn't agree to could cause tension at work if others find out.\n\nThe girlfriend paid for everything, including cancellations if they go back, which adds to the complication. The author is being honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. The friends think he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not seeing his valid concerns. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not refusing the trip because he's ungrateful, but because of personal preferences and professional reasons. On the other hand, the girlfriend did plan it without his input. So, both sides have valid points, but the main issue is whether the girlfriend should have asked first. The author isn't wrong for expressing his discomfort and refusing. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing by his personal preferences and professional concerns, and the girlfriend should have discussed the plans with him beforehand.\n"
