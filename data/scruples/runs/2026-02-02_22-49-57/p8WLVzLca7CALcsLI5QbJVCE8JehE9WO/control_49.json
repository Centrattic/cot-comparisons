Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The girlfriend planned a surprise vacation funded by her, using their boss to get time off without asking him first. The author is upset because she didn't consult him and the arrangement might be unprofessional.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend used her position in HR to coordinate with their boss. That part might be a problem because even though she's in HR, using her role to secure time off for a personal vacation could be seen as mixing work and personal matters. The author works in IT, so maybe there's a conflict there. But the main issue is that the girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to go. He mentions he'd prefer to relax and sleep, which is a valid preference. \n\nThe author didn't express his preference until she asked why he wasn't happy. He then refused, which led to her annoyance. His friends say he's ungrateful. But is he obligated to go? If the trip was a surprise, the girlfriend should have considered his opinion beforehand. It's a gift, but it's a big decision to use vacation days, and he has the right to decline if it's not what he wants. \n\nAlso, the method of getting time off without consulting him could be problematic. Using their mutual boss to keep it secret might be unprofessional, as the author points out. This could affect their careers. The girlfriend might not have realized the potential issues here.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for declining because the trip was planned without his consent, especially regarding work-related leave. His preference should be respected. The girlfriend made assumptions and took steps without considering his input. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
