Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland. She talked to their mutual boss months in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to take an overseas trip. He also thinks asking their boss for couples leave is unprofessional. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him. Even though she paid for everything, the author has the right to his own preferences. Using leave without discussing it could be a problem, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. That might look unprofessional, which the author is right to point out.\n\nHe didn't want to go overseas to relax and sleep, which is a valid personal preference. The fact that she spent money already doesn't negate his right to say no. The friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the point about consent and respect for boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for refusing. The girlfriend should have asked first. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
