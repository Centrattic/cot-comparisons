Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The girlfriend, who works in HR, planned a surprise two-week trip to Switzerland. She used her position to get the couple's leave approved by their mutual boss without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't agree to this and would prefer to use his leave time to relax at home. He refused to go, and now the girlfriend is upset, while friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend made a significant decision without the author's consent, used company resources (by getting leave approved) secretly, and the author feels this was unprofessional and a breach of trust. The author's main argument is that he should have been asked first, as he didn't want an overseas trip.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping. Even though she meant well, arranging leave without the author's input and using work connections in secret might be unprofessional, especially since they report to the same boss. Additionally, the author has the right to decide how he uses his vacation time. The girlfriend's surprise, while thoughtful, didn't consider the author's preferences, leading to his refusal. \n\nThe author's friends think he's ungrateful, but the issue is more about consent and respecting personal choices. The girlfriend's actions might have crossed a line by not discussing the trip with him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing that he doesn't want to go, especially since his reasons are valid (preference for relaxation, potential career risks from unprofessional leave requests). \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
