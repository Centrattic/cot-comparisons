Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation, paid for it, and told the author that their boss had been informed. The author is upset because the girlfriend didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to go on the trip. Friends are saying he's being ungrateful, but he thinks she should have checked with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend did make plans without consulting him, which is a big deal. The author feels that using company leave for a trip without his input is unprofessional and possibly a risk to his career. Also, he mentioned that he prefers to relax and sleep during his leave, which is a valid personal preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did put effort into planning this and might have thought it was a nice surprise. However, the fact that she involved their boss without his knowledge could be a problem, especially since they both work under the same higher-up. That could lead to awkward situations or professional issues if discovered. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the girlfriend should have asked him before making such significant decisions. People have different preferences for how they want to spend their time off, and not discussing it could lead to conflict. The girlfriend's approach might have been well-meaning, but respecting his autonomy is important in a relationship. \n\nThe friends suggesting he's ungrateful might not be considering his valid concerns. Just because something is a gift doesn't mean it's appropriate if it's against the recipient's wishes. The author isn't refusing out of spite but because of personal and professional reasons. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend made a decision that affects both of their work situations and the author's personal time without consulting him. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding his career and how he uses his leave. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong here.\n"
