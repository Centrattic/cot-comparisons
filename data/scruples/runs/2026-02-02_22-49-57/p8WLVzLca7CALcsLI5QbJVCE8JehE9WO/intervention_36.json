Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves a couple who work in different departments but under the same boss. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, coordinating with their mutual boss without the author's knowledge. He's upset because she didn't ask him first and he's concerned about the professionalism of using company leave for a romantic trip. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he believes she should have talked to him first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip without consulting him, which he found intrusive. He values his autonomy in deciding how to use his vacation time. Even though she paid for everything, he doesn't want to travel overseas and prefers to relax at home. The fact that she involved their boss without his input adds a layer of professional concern. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, major decisions like this usually require mutual agreement. While surprising someone can be thoughtful, it's important to respect boundaries. He felt she overstepped by making such a significant decision without his input, especially one that affects his work schedule and personal preferences. \n\nHis friends argue he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean he has to accept something he doesn't want. The core issue is consent and communication. She didn't ask for his opinion, which is a valid point. The author's decision to refuse isn't just about the trip itself but about the lack of communication and respect for his autonomy.\n\nProfessionally, coordinating with their boss without his knowledge could be risky, as he mentioned. Even if the boss approved, it's unorthodox and might raise eyebrows. This adds another reason for his hesitation. \n\nSo, considering the aspects of communication, autonomy, and professionalism, the author's stance makes sense. He's not wrong for wanting to assert his preferences. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
