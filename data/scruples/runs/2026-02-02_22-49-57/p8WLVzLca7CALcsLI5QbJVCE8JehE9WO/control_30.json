Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go because she didn't ask him first and he's concerned about professional implications.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend arranged the trip without consulting him. She talked to their boss in advance, which he finds unprofessional. He's worried about the implications of taking couple's leave and prefers to use his time off to relax and sleep. The friends think he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked him first.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the girlfriend overstep by making the decision without his input? Is the author wrong for not accepting the gift? The author's main issue is that the trip was planned without his consent, and he has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preferences. The girlfriend's actions might have been well-intentioned, but she didn't consider his feelings or preferences. The author's refusal is based on his own priorities and the potential professional risks. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's intentions were good, but she didn't respect his autonomy in the decision. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to go to an overseas trip he didn't plan for, especially when it could affect his career. His friends' advice to accept might overlook his valid concerns. The author's right to make his own decisions about his leave time is important here. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
