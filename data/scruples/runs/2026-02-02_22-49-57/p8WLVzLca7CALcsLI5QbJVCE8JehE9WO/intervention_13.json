Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The author's main points are that the girlfriend used their mutual boss to secure leave without asking him and didn't consult him about the trip. He's upset because he doesn't want to travel overseas and prefers to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him, even arranging leave with their boss. That's a big step, especially since using company resources for personal leave could be a professional risk. The author is concerned about professionalism and not being asked. From his perspective, it's about autonomy and consent in the relationship. He has a right to decide how he uses his personal time, so being unconsulted might make him feel disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to give a surprise birthday gift. She might have thought it was a romantic gesture, especially if she took the time to plan and pay for everything. Her friends are saying he's ungrateful, which adds another layer\u2014maybe the girlfriend felt hurt by his refusal.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did he have the right to refuse? Should he have been more appreciative? The girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping by not checking with him, especially regarding his leave. Using their boss without consultation could be a breach of professional boundaries, which the author correctly points out. Also, the fact that he didn't want to travel shows that he has different preferences. So, the author's refusal is based on valid concerns about his career and personal wishes.\n\nThe girlfriend's mistake was not seeking his input. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by his decision to not go. He's justified in feeling that his preferences should be considered, especially regarding his own time and work commitments. The friends advising him to go might not recognize his right to autonomy in this situation.\n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. He has valid reasons for his refusal and the girlfriend should have asked him first.\n"
