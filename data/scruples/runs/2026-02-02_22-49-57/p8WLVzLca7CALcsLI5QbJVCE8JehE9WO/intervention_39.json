Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation without consulting her partner, who works in IT and they're in different departments but report to the same boss.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend arranged two weeks of paid leave without the author's consent, even talking to their boss months in advance. The author feels this is unprofessional because they didn't apply for leave themselves, which could affect their career. Also, he doesn't want to travel overseas and prefers to relax at home.\n\nThe author refused to go, saying she should have asked him first. His friends think he's ungrateful, but he's standing by his decision. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, maybe to spend time together. But the author's concerns about professional boundaries and personal preferences are valid. Using company leave for personal travel without the employee's input could be problematic, especially in a corporate setting. The author's job in IT might require specific leave approvals, which the girlfriend handled without consulting him. That could lead to issues if the boss isn't supposed to grant leave like that. Also, the author's preference to relax at home is a personal choice that deserved consideration.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been well-meaning, but she overstepped by making decisions that affect his work and personal time without his input. The author's refusal is about respecting his autonomy and professional boundaries. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's justified in wanting to make his own decisions about his leave and personal time. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first, regardless of her good intentions.\n"
