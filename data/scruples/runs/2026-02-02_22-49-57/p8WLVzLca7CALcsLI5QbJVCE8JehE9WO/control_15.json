Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She coordinated with their mutual boss, which the author sees as unprofessional. He didn't ask for leave and would rather use that time to relax at home. He's upset she didn't ask him first, leading to a conflict.\n\nHe mentions that using company leave for a couples' trip could be unprofessional, especially since they report to the same boss. He also values his personal time and prefers to use it for rest. His friends call him ungrateful, but he's standing by his decision because he wasn't consulted.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, the girlfriend's intention was to surprise him, which is a common gesture. However, big decisions like vacation plans usually require mutual agreement. She did spend money, but he's concerned about the professional implications and his own preferences. \n\nHe's not saying no because he's ungrateful but because the planning was done without his input and might affect his career. While her gesture was thoughtful, he has valid reasons related to work and personal preference. The key issue is lack of communication and respecting his autonomy in planning his time off.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't wrong. He has legitimate concerns about professionalism and personal choice, which are valid even if the girlfriend's intentions were good.\n"
