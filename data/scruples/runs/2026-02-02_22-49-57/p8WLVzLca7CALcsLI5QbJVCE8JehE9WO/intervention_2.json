Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend. The scenario is that the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, got their boss's approval in advance without telling the author, and the author is upset because he didn't want to take a vacation like that. He prefers relaxing and sleeping instead. The girlfriend is annoyed, and his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are that the girlfriend didn't ask him first, and that using work leave for a trip could be unprofessional. Also, he didn't want to go on an overseas holiday. The girlfriend, on the other hand, planned this as a surprise, thinking it was a nice gesture, maybe to make his birthday special. She took the initiative, but without his consent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I need to agree or disagree. \n\nAutonomy in relationships is important. The girlfriend organized a trip without considering the author's preferences. Even if she had good intentions, making such a significant decision without discussing it with her partner could be problematic. The author has the right to decide how he spends his leave time. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, disregarded his autonomy and could be seen as overstepping. \n\nProfessional considerations: The girlfriend approached their boss without the author's knowledge. If their boss is also their supervisor, this could create a conflict of interest or ethical issues. The author is concerned about professionalism, which is valid. Using company leave for a personal trip without the employee's consent might look unprofessional, especially if it's a couple's trip and could affect their work relationship with the boss.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on his own preferences and the fact that he wasn't consulted. The girlfriend's surprise might have been intended to be a romantic gesture, but she didn't consider his feelings or preferences. The author's friends saying he's ungrateful might not take into account his valid reasons for not wanting to go. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him instead of making it a surprise. The author isn't wrong for wanting to use his leave as he prefers. He's not being ungrateful for the gesture, but asserting his right to make his own choices. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
