Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend planned the trip, got flights and a resort, and talked to their boss in advance. The author feels she shouldn't have done that without asking him first. He's worried about the unprofessionalism of asking their boss for couples' leave and doesn't want to travel overseas. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have consulted him.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: She made a big decision without consulting him. Even though it's a surprise, she used his leave time, which he didn't agree to. The author is right to be concerned because using time off for a trip without permission could be unprofessional. Also, he didn't want to go on the trip, so she should have asked. \n\nBut she did plan it with the boss, maybe thinking it's a nice gesture. However, she didn't consider his preferences. The author's main issue is that his autonomy over his own time was disregarded. He's not being ungrateful for the gesture, but for the method. \n\nThe friends' reaction is that he's ungrateful, but the key point is consent. He didn't say yes to the trip. So he's not wrong for not wanting to go. The girlfriend shouldn't have planned it without his input, especially when it affects his work and personal preferences.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his personal boundaries and work concerns. The answer should be B.\n"
