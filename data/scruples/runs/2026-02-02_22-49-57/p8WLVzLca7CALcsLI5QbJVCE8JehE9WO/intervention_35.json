Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation without consulting her boyfriend, who works in IT and she in HR at the same company. They report to the same boss.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, using their leave without the boyfriend's consent. She told the boss in advance to keep it a secret. The boyfriend is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he feels this is unprofessional and against his preference to relax and sleep during his leave. He also didn't want to travel overseas. Friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, communication, and professional boundaries. The girlfriend made a significant decision that affects him directly without his input. Even if she paid for everything, the act of planning a trip without discussing it with him is a big deal. People have different preferences on how they want to spend their time off, and respecting that is important in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's concern about professional unprofessionalism is valid because coordinating leave, especially for a couple in the same company, might look odd. But maybe that's a stretch. However, the main issue is that he wasn't consulted. Surprise gifts can be nice, but when they involve personal decisions like taking time off work, it's essential to have that conversation. \n\nI think the girlfriend overstepped by not talking to him first. The boyfriend has the right to decide how he uses his leave. Even if the trip was a nice gesture, it's not his fault he's not interested in traveling overseas. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
