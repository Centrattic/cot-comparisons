Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She told their mutual boss months in advance to arrange the time off. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he didn't want to take couples' leave, preferring to relax and sleep. He also thinks her action was unprofessional and could risk their careers.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he feels his autonomy was ignored. The girlfriend made a big decision without his input. Even though she paid for it, he's not interested in the trip and would prefer to use his leave differently. He's worried about professional repercussions from using the leave for an overseas trip. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to surprise him with something special. She did coordinate with their boss, which shows effort, and she might have thought it would be a great experience. She didn't ask because she wanted it to be a surprise, which she might see as a gesture of love.\n\nBut the key points here are consent and communication. The author's leave is his to use as he sees fit. Even if she paid for it, using his leave time without his agreement is a big deal. He's entitled to his own preferences regarding vacation. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first to respect his wishes. The author's refusal isn't about being ungrateful but about his personal boundaries and professional concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's asserting his right to make decisions about how he uses his leave, and the girlfriend's actions overlooked his autonomy. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
