Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation arranged by their girlfriend. The main points are: the girlfriend paid for a two-week trip to Switzerland, she coordinated with their mutual boss without the author's knowledge, and he's upset because she didn't consult him first. He doesn't want to travel and prefers to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with him. Even though it's a surprise, it's a significant commitment involving work leave and his personal preferences. The author's concern about professionalism is valid because their boss was involved without his input. That could lead to issues if the company doesn't approve such leave without the employee's direct request.\n\nThen there's the aspect of autonomy. The author should have the right to decide how he uses his vacation time. The girlfriend didn't ask for his opinion, which is a key part of mutual decision-making in a relationship. While the gesture is thoughtful, it's possible she overstepped by not considering his preferences. \n\nThe friends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't negate the need for communication. It's possible the author appreciates the effort but is standing by his personal boundaries. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she wanted to do something nice, but the author's right to choose his own plans is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He could have handled it more gently, perhaps by thanking her and explaining his feelings, but the core issue is about respecting his autonomy. The girlfriend should have asked first. So the answer would be B.\n"
