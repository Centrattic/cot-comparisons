Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend organized a trip to Switzerland, got leave approved from their mutual boss, and didn't consult him first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are that the girlfriend didn't ask him before booking, she involved their boss which could be unprofessional, and he prefers to relax at home. The girlfriend's perspective is that she surprised him, which might be a gesture of love and effort, and she's already paid for everything.\n\nThe key issues here are consent and communication. The author feels that since he wasn't consulted, the decision to use his leave for a trip wasn't his choice. He's also worried about professional implications because the boss was involved without his knowledge. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see this as a thoughtful surprise, not considering his preferences.\n\nLegally and ethically, using someone's leave without their consent is problematic. Even though it's a surprise, the author's autonomy in deciding how to use his time is important. The fact that the girlfriend went to their boss without his knowledge adds a layer of unprofessionalism, especially since they work in the same company. This could lead to complications at work if others find out.\n\nThe author's close friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude should be balanced with respecting personal boundaries. The girlfriend's intentions were good, but the method was flawed. The author has valid concerns about his preferences and professional risks. He's not obligated to go on a trip he didn't agree to, even if it's a surprise.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) categories, if the author's refusal is based on legitimate concerns about his autonomy and work, he's not the asshole. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first before making arrangements. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
