Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the described situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation to Switzerland, using her HR position to coordinate with their boss for time off, without consulting the author first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend didn't ask him about taking the leave for the trip and that she used her professional role to get approval without consulting him. He felt that using company leave for an overseas trip might be unprofessional and that he should have a say in how he spends his time off. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is he in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks B, and wants to know if that's correct.\n\nI need to analyze the ethical aspects here. The girlfriend planned a surprise, which can be seen as thoughtful, but she made a significant decision without his input. The author's right to make his own decisions about his personal time is a factor. Also, using her position to secure leave without his consent could be problematic. The author's job is in IT, so coordinating time off without his knowledge might affect his work, even if it's for a vacation.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, might have overstepped by not discussing the trip first. The author's refusal isn't about the gift itself but the lack of consultation. He's not rejecting her effort but the fact that she didn't consider his preferences. The cancellation fees are a consequence of her going ahead without asking, but that doesn't mean he should go against his will.\n\nLooking at societal norms, while surprises are common, major life decisions should involve mutual agreement. The girlfriend's approach could have been more considerate of his autonomy. The author's stance is about respecting his personal choices, which is valid.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (no, the author is not in the wrong) because his objection is about being consulted, not the trip itself. His concerns about professional ethics and personal preferences are legitimate.\n"
