Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland for the author's birthday, using their leave time without his consent. The author refused to go because he felt it was unprofessional to ask their boss for leave without consulting him first, and he prefers to use his leave time to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with the author. She did check with their boss, but didn't ask the author himself. The author feels that this is a significant decision that should have been mutual. The main issue here is consent and communication in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's action of booking the trip without consulting him might be seen as overstepping, especially since using vacation time is a personal choice. The author's refusal isn't about the trip itself but about the lack of communication. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude isn't the main issue here\u2014it's about mutual decision-making. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend did pay for everything and might face cancellation fees. But the author's concern is valid because major life decisions, especially those affecting work and personal preferences, should involve both parties. The fact that she approached their boss without his knowledge adds a layer of potential unprofessionalism, which the author rightly points out.\n\nSo, the author's stance isn't about being ungrateful but about respecting boundaries and communication. The girlfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, were done without his input. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing because the surprise crossed the line into making a unilateral decision that affects him significantly. The answer should be B (No).\n"
