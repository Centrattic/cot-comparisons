Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, got the boss's approval without telling the author, and now he's upset because she didn't ask first. He wants to use his leave to relax and sleep, not travel. She's annoyed, his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's main grievances are: she didn't consult him before booking, she approached their boss without his knowledge (which he thinks is unprofessional), and he prefers not to travel. The girlfriend's actions were a surprise, which is a common gesture, but maybe she overstepped by not getting his input. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, so I need to see if that's valid. The girlfriend did plan it secretly, which can be nice, but she skipped the step of checking with him. He has valid reasons: not wanting to travel, concern about professional repercussions (though maybe he's being too cautious about the boss's reaction). Also, he doesn't want to use his leave for something he wasn't consulted on. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel she was trying to do something nice and was hurt by his refusal. But the author's right to have his preferences respected is important. Consent and communication in relationships matter. Even if the surprise was meant to be a gift, respecting the other person's wishes is key. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and refusing. His friends' reaction might be because they don't see his perspective, but he's justified in prioritizing his own comfort and professional boundaries. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
