Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland for the author's birthday. She went to their mutual boss to arrange the time off in advance without telling him. The author didn't want to go because he thinks using leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional and he prefers to relax at home. He refused to go, got into an argument with his girlfriend, and now his friends are saying he's ungrateful.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for his birthday. She used her position in HR to coordinate with their boss, which might be tricky because they work in different branches. She did plan it in advance, which suggests she wanted to make sure the time off was approved. She probably thought it was a thoughtful gesture, something he would enjoy. However, she didn't ask him if he wanted to go, which is a key point here. The author didn't have a say in the planning, and that's a problem because it's his leave time and his personal preference.\n\nOn the author's side, he's concerned about professionalism. If he's an IT worker, taking time off for a ski trip in Switzerland might not be considered relaxing in the way he wants. He prefers to relax and sleep, which is a valid personal preference. The girlfriend overstepped by involving their boss without his consent. Using work leave for personal travel without prior agreement from the employee could be seen as inappropriate. Also, the fact that they report to the same boss adds another layer of potential awkwardness or professional risk if this were to become known.\n\nThe author's friends are telling him he's being ungrateful. But gratitude isn't about going along with something you don't want to do. The girlfriend should have communicated with him first. Even if the surprise was well-intentioned, it's important to respect the other person's preferences and boundaries. The author has the right to decide how he uses his personal time. The girlfriend's actions could have put his career at risk by making unauthorized requests to their boss, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the key issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend planned something without checking with the author, which is a major oversight. The author is justified in feeling that his personal time was taken over without his input. His refusal isn't ungratefulness but standing up for his own preferences and professional boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility was on the girlfriend to ask first. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
