Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation. The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, arranged with their mutual boss months in advance without consulting him. The author is upset because she didn't ask for his input, especially since he prefers to relax and sleep during his leave. He also thinks it's unprofessional to use company leave for a couples' trip, even though they talked to their boss. He didn't want to go, but instead of returning the tickets (which would cost her), he told her he'd refuse because she didn't ask him first. Now she's annoyed, and his friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, so I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend made a surprise without consulting him. She did plan it with their boss, which might have been a good gesture, but the main issue is that she didn't check with him about the trip itself. The author has valid concerns about professional boundaries, since using company leave for a vacation could be seen as unprofessional, especially if it's a couple's trip. He also has personal preferences about how he wants to spend his time off. He's not being ungrateful by refusing; he's standing by his own preferences. She did go through the effort to plan it, but he's not obligated to go along with it if it doesn't align with his wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she wanted to do something special for his birthday and went to the trouble of organizing it. His friends think he's ungrateful, implying that rejecting a gift, even a big one, might be seen as not appreciative. However, the author's reasoning isn't about not appreciating the effort but about the lack of consultation and personal preference.\n\nThe core of the issue is autonomy and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to go, which is a major oversight. He has the right to decide how to use his personal time. Even though she paid for everything, he's not required to accept a gift that doesn't suit his preferences. The argument about professional ethics is valid if the company's policies consider such leave requests unprofessional, but even if that's not the case, the personal aspect of his time is his own.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own preferences and communication needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
