Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to go on a surprise vacation that his girlfriend paid for, even though she talked to their boss in advance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She went to their boss (they both report to the same boss) months ahead to keep it a secret. The author is upset because taking leave for such a trip might look unprofessional, and he prefers to use his leave to relax at home. He didn't like that she made the decision without his input, especially since she didn't ask if he wanted to go. He ended up refusing the trip, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate both sides. From the author's perspective, using company leave for a couples' trip could be a red flag if they're in the same company. Even if the boss agreed, it might still affect his professional reputation. Also, he felt that major decisions about his personal time should be made jointly, not unilaterally. His preference is clear he's not interested in overseas travel, so her not asking him first is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend wanted to do something special for his birthday, and she went through the trouble of organizing everything, even incurring financial costs. She might feel hurt that he's not appreciating the effort and gift. Her friends think he's being ungrateful, which adds pressure on him to accept.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author's main issue is that the decision was made without his consent, and he has legitimate concerns about professional implications. Even if the trip was a generous gesture, he has the right to refuse if it conflicts with his values or preferences. His response might be seen as firm but reasonable.\n\nHowever, could he have communicated this more gracefully? Maybe. Instead of flatly refusing, he could have discussed his concerns without dismissing the gesture entirely. But the core issue is whether he was wrong to refuse. Since the trip wasn't discussed beforehand and he has valid reasons, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend could have checked in with him before organizing the trip, but she didn't. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
