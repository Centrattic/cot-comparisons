Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland but didn't ask him first. The author is upset because he didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and thinks she should have consulted him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise vacation using company leave, which the author didn't agree to. He felt it was unprofessional to ask their boss for leave without his consent. Also, he preferred to use his time to relax and sleep. He didn't want to travel overseas, so he refused, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She took the initiative, maybe to make his birthday special, but didn't consult him. She used her position in HR to coordinate with their boss. However, she didn't consider his preferences. The author feels it's unprofessional and invasive. He has the right to his own time, and his leave should be his decision. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making plans, especially since it's his leave time. \n\nThe author's response: He told her he would refuse because she didn't ask him first. Friends say he's ungrateful, but the issue is about respecting personal choice. The girlfriend's surprise might be well-intentioned, but the method could be problematic. \n\nKey factors: Autonomy over personal time vs. thoughtfulness of surprise. The girlfriend's action might have crossed boundaries by not seeking permission. The author's right to decide how to use his leave. The fact that she already paid and incurred fees doesn't negate the need for consent. \n\nPossible arguments for the author not being wrong: He has the right to his own schedule, and his refusal is about personal choice. The girlfriend's action was presumptuous. \n\nArguments for the author being wrong: She intended a nice surprise, maybe didn't realize how he felt about traveling. He could have communicated his preference earlier. \n\nBut the main issue is consent. Since the leave is the author's to manage, she shouldn't have arranged it without his input. So the author's stance is about respecting his autonomy. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
