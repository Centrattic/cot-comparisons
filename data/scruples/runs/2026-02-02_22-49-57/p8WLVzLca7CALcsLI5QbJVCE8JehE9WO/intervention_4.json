Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend. The main points here are the girlfriend organizing the trip without consulting him, using company leave, and the author's refusal.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend used their mutual boss to secure leave without asking the author. That's a big issue because it's unprofessional and could affect his job. The author is right to be concerned about career implications. Also, she didn't ask him if he wanted to go on the trip, which is a personal choice. People have different preferences for how they spend their time off, and he clearly states he'd rather relax and sleep. \n\nThe girlfriend paid for everything, but that doesn't mean he should feel obligated to go. She should have discussed the trip with him first. The fact that she went ahead without his input is a problem. Friends calling him ungrateful are probably missing the point. The author's main issue is the lack of consultation and the unprofessional handling of leave. \n\nSo, considering he refused because she didn't ask, and the situation involved potential professional risks without his consent, he's justified in his stance. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
