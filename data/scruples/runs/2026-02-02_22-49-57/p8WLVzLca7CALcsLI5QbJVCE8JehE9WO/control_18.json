Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a surprise two-week trip to Switzerland. She had talked to their mutual boss months in advance to get leave approved without consulting the author. The author is upset because he feels this was unprofessional and that he wasn't asked first. He prefers to use his leave time to relax at home. The girlfriend has already paid for everything, including non-refundable bookings.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Did the girlfriend overstep by arranging leave without his consent? 2) Is the author justified in refusing the trip even though it's a generous gift?\n\nStarting with the girlfriend's actions. She did coordinate with their boss, which could indeed be seen as unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments but under the same manager. In some workplaces, discussing an employee's leave without their input might be against HR policies, even if she's in HR herself. However, she might have thought she was doing something nice, showing initiative.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's not thrilled about the trip. He values his personal time and would prefer to relax, not travel. The fact that his leave was arranged without his input is a big deal because using leave is a personal decision. Even if the intention was good, the method was problematic. He has the right to decide how he uses his vacation time. \n\nThe girlfriend's annoyance at him not being excited could be because she put in a lot of effort, but the author's reasons for declining are valid. The friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean complying with every request, especially when it infringes on personal preferences and professional boundaries.\n\nThe key here is consent and communication. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip and the leave arrangement with the author first. The fact that she didn't might have made the situation more about her desire than his. The author isn't being ungrateful; he's standing up for his own needs and boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He has a right to his own preferences and to have his leave decisions respected. The girlfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, crossed a line by not seeking his input first. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
