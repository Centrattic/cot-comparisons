Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The scenario involves some key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She spoke to their mutual boss months in advance to secure the leave. The author is upset because he feels it's unprofessional to use company leave for a couples' trip, and he didn't want to go on an overseas vacation. He also mentions he prefers to relax and sleep during his leave time. He refused to go, leading to his girlfriend being annoyed, and his friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Now, I need to determine if the answer is A or B based on the situation.\n\nKey factors to consider: \n\n1. **Respect for Personal Preferences**: The author had no say in the planning. Using vacation time, which is personal time, without his consent could be an issue. The girlfriend assumed he wanted to go, but he clearly states he doesn't. That's a boundary issue.\n\n2. **Professionalism Concerns**: Since they work in the same company and report to the same boss, the girlfriend's action might be seen as unprofessional. Asking for leave for a personal trip without the employee's agreement could lead to complications. The author is right to be concerned about potential career impacts.\n\n3. **Gratitude vs. Autonomy**: The girlfriend's friends are telling him to go, but his main issue is not the trip itself but the lack of consultation. Being grateful isn't the same as agreeing to something. The author's right to choose how he uses his personal time is important.\n\n4. **Financial Considerations**: The tickets and resorts are already paid for. The author doesn't want to waste money, but the root issue is the lack of consent. Even if there are cancellation fees, the fact that he wasn't involved in the decision is a problem.\n\n5. **Communication Issues**: The author didn't express his feelings until after the surprise. Maybe if he had communicated his preferences earlier, the situation could have been avoided. However, the girlfriend's approach was to keep it a secret, which might have prevented him from voicing his concerns.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the girlfriend made a major decision affecting him without his input. The author is within his rights to refuse, especially since it's his vacation time. The friends' perspective that he's ungrateful might not consider the lack of consent as a valid reason. The author's reasons are valid: professionalism, personal preference, and autonomy over his own time. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
