Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid surprise vacation to Switzerland. The key points are that the girlfriend organized it without consulting him, used their mutual boss to arrange time off, and now the author is refusing to go because he didn't agree to it and prefers to relax and sleep instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for his birthday, which is a thoughtful gesture. She went through the trouble of booking everything and informing their boss in advance, which required planning. However, the author feels that she overstepped by making decisions for him without his input. He might feel that personal time is his to decide, and that she shouldn't have used company resources (by involving their boss) without his consent.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, asking a mutual boss for leave without the employee's knowledge could be problematic. It might look unprofessional if the boss is approached by someone else for personal time off, especially if it's a couple's decision. The author is right to be concerned about potential career implications here.\n\nOn the personal side, the girlfriend might have intended to show her love and care, but she didn't communicate with him about his preferences. The author's main issue is that he wasn't consulted. Even if the gesture is generous, the method lacks mutual agreement. People have different preferences for how they want to spend their free time. The author's preference for rest over traveling is valid, and he has the right to express that.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt because her surprise was rejected, but the author's right to choose how he uses his leave is important. The friends' advice that he's ungrateful might stem from not understanding his reasons. The author's refusal isn't about the gift itself but about the lack of communication and respect for his autonomy.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making plans. The author isn't wrong for stating his boundaries, even if it disappoints her. He's not rejecting her generosity but asserting his personal preferences and professional concerns.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies in the lack of communication from the girlfriend's side rather than the author's refusal.\n"
