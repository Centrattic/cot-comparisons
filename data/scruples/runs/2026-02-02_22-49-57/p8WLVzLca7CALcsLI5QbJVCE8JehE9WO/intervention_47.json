Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation, paid for by her, but the author didn't want to go because she didn't ask first and he's concerned about professional issues and personal preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, booked flights and ski resorts. She talked to their boss in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because she didn't consult him, he doesn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip, and he's worried about the professional implications of asking for couples' leave. He ended up refusing the trip, and now his girlfriend is annoyed, while friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but she did it without considering his preferences. The author's main issues are: not being consulted, potential professional repercussions from the boss, and personal preference for relaxation over travel.\n\nIs the author wrong for refusing? Well, he has valid points. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. It's a significant decision, especially involving work leave and personal time. The fact that she went behind his back and involved their boss might have crossed a line, even if her intentions were good. The author's right to have his preferences respected is important here. People have different ways they want to spend their time off, and not everyone enjoys traveling. The professional aspect adds another layer\u2014using company leave for a couples' trip could be seen as unprofessional, which he's rightly concerned about.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something thoughtful, maybe thinking it would be a fun experience. But the key issue is consent and communication. She didn't check with him, which is a problem in a relationship. The author isn't being ungrateful; he's standing up for his boundaries. His friends' reaction that he's ungrateful might stem from a misunderstanding of the situation, not considering his valid concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He has every right to refuse a trip that he wasn't consulted about, especially when it involves work and his personal preferences. The girlfriend's mistake was not discussing it with him first. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
