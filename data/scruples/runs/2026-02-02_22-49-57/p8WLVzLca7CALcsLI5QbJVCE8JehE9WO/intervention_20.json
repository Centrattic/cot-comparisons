Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The girlfriend arranged everything without consulting him, even talking to their boss in advance. The author is annoyed because he thinks using couples' leave is unprofessional and he prefers to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend organized the trip without discussing it with him. She went to their boss without his knowledge, which he finds unprofessional. He didn't like the trip idea and wants to use his leave to rest. The key issue here is whether he's being ungrateful or if his reasons are valid.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he didn't agree to the trip. His objection is about professional conduct and personal preference. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she did something thoughtful, but the author feels his boundaries were crossed. The friends think he's ungrateful, but maybe they don't see his valid concerns about work and personal time.\n\nThe girlfriend didn't check with him, which is a major oversight. Even though the trip is generous, respecting each other's preferences is important in a relationship. The author's concern about professional implications is valid because coordinating leave between two people in the same company could be problematic. Also, his right to choose how he uses his leave should be respected.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. His reasons are understandable. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. The answer is B.\n"
