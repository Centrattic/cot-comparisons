Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. The key points here are about consent, communication, and professional boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland without asking the author. She arranged it through their mutual boss, which could be a problem if it's unprofessional. The author didn't know about it until he received the tickets and found out the boss was involved. He's upset because he wasn't consulted and feels that using company leave for an overseas trip could jeopardize his career. He also prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. He tried to refuse, but she had already paid, and he's worried about cancellation fees. His friends say he should be grateful and go, but he's conflicted.\n\nThe main issue here is that the girlfriend made a significant decision without consulting him. Even though it's a surprise and a thoughtful gesture, the author has autonomy over his vacation time. Using their boss without his knowledge might cross professional lines, and the author is right to be concerned about how that could affect his job. Also, not asking him what he wants is a communication problem. People have different preferences for how they want to spend their time off, and assuming he'd want a trip could be seen as dismissive of his wishes. The girlfriend's approach was overzealous and possibly disrespectful of his boundaries. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting to refuse; he has valid reasons related to his career and personal preferences. The friends' advice to be grateful might not consider his legitimate concerns.\n"
