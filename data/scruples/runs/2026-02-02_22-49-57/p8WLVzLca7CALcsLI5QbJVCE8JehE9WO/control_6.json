Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland for their birthday, paid for everything, and got leave approval from their boss without asking them. The author is upset because they think the girlfriend's actions were unprofessional and that she should have asked first before using their leave time. The friends are saying they're ungrateful and should just go.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend used her position in HR to talk to their mutual boss about taking leave, which she did without consulting the author. The author is in IT, a different branch, so maybe that's why they didn't discuss it. The author feels that using their leave for an overseas trip is not something the girlfriend should have decided without their input. They prefer to use the leave to relax and sleep instead. The girlfriend is annoyed because the author didn't seem happy and he told her he wanted to refuse the trip because she didn't ask first. \n\nSo the main issue here is whether the girlfriend overstepped by making this decision without the author's consent. The author argues that the girlfriend should have asked before using their leave, which is a valid point because taking someone's time off work, especially for a significant trip, is a big decision. The girlfriend's intention might have been to do something nice, but the method could be problematic. \n\nThe boss was involved, and it's mentioned that the boss is the same for both. The girlfriend approached the boss months in advance, which might have been seen as planning, but the author feels this was unprofessional. In some workplaces, coordinating leave, especially for a couple, could be a delicate matter. If the girlfriend used her HR role to influence the boss's decision without the employee's (the author's) knowledge, that could indeed be a conflict of interest. \n\nAnother angle is the author's right to choose how to use their own leave. Even if the girlfriend had the best intentions, the leave was the author's personal time. By not asking, she made an assumption about their preferences. The author's preference is to relax and sleep, which is a legitimate use of vacation time. The girlfriend's action might have been a kind gesture, but the lack of communication is a problem. \n\nThe friends are telling the author to go, saying they're ungrateful. But gratitude isn't the same as obligation. The author isn't wrong for valuing their own autonomy and the way their leave is used. The girlfriend could have discussed it first, even if she had already made plans. The author's point about professional boundaries is also important. If the girlfriend's actions could jeopardize the author's career, that's a serious concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt she was showing love and effort by planning the trip. But that doesn't negate the need for consent. The author's right to control their own schedule is a key factor here. Also, the fact that the girlfriend paid for everything and there would be cancellation fees might make the author feel pressured, which complicates things. However, the author's main issue is about the principle of being asked first, not the cost. \n\nSo, the author's stance seems reasonable. They didn't want to go on an overseas trip and prefer their own way of relaxing. The girlfriend's failure to communicate and the potential unprofessionalism in her approach could be the main issues. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
