Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The key points here are about consent, communication, and professional boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without discussing it with him. She went to their mutual boss in advance to arrange leave, which he's concerned might be unprofessional. The author feels she should have asked him first. The main issue is that she made a significant decision without consulting him, which affects his personal time and career. \n\nHe's not against the trip itself but the method of arranging it without his input. His friends say he's ungrateful, but his argument is about autonomy and being a co-decision maker in their relationship. There's also the professional risk involved if their boss's involvement is seen as inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was a surprise gift, which many people do. However, the execution involved third-party involvement (their boss) without his knowledge, which could have repercussions. The author's right to his own time and preferences is valid. He's not rejecting the trip out of spite but because he values mutual agreement in such decisions. \n\nSo, considering that he's standing up for his boundaries and professional concerns, the author's stance makes sense. The girlfriend's actions, while well-meaning, overstepped by not seeking his input. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
