Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and arranged leave with their boss without asking the author first. The author is upset because they didn't want to use their leave for overseas travel and felt she should have discussed it with them before making plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did something nice and surprising, which she probably thought the author would appreciate. She went to the trouble of getting the boss's approval and paying for everything. The author is in IT, and the girlfriend is in HR, so maybe she had the means or connections to pull this off. But the author feels that using their leave for a vacation without their consent is a problem. They mention that using leave for couples' trips could be unprofessional, which might affect their career. Also, the author would prefer to relax at home, so the vacation isn't something they wanted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask the author if they wanted to go, which is a big issue. Even if the author didn't like the idea, the girlfriend made a significant commitment without their input. On the other hand, the author might have been more enthusiastic and maybe could have discussed it after, but they did express their refusal. The author's main argument is that the decision was made without them, which is a valid concern. The friends saying the author is ungrateful might be missing the point that the problem is about the lack of consultation rather than the gift itself.\n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend overstepped by making plans without discussing them first, the author's refusal is understandable. They have a right to control their own leave and how they spend it. The boss's approval might not matter if the author doesn't want to use the time that way. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't get their consent before making such a big decision. The answer should be B."
