Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation planned by the girlfriend without consulting the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland for the boyfriend's birthday. She told him she had discussed it with their boss in advance. The boyfriend is upset because she didn't ask him first, used their company leave, and he prefers to relax and sleep instead of traveling. He refused to go, and now the girlfriend is annoyed. Friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo the main issues here are: 1) She didn't consult him about using his leave. 2) She told their boss without his knowledge. 3) He doesn't want to travel overseas. 4) The girlfriend might face cancellation fees if he doesn't go.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he's concerned about professionalism. Using company leave for a couples' trip could look bad, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. He might fear that this could affect his career, which is a valid concern. Also, the fact that she didn't ask him at all is a problem because it's his leave, and he has the right to decide how to use it. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned, but she overstepped by making a major decision without his input. Even if she had good reasons, like wanting to celebrate their birthday, the method was flawed. The boyfriend's preference to relax instead of travel is valid too. People have different ways they want to spend their time off, and he's within his rights to choose.\n\nThe friends saying he's ungrateful might not consider his perspective. Being given an expensive gift without prior discussion can lead to resentment if it's something the recipient doesn't want. The girlfriend might have felt she was being generous, but the lack of communication is a key issue here.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's standing up for his preferences and professional boundaries. The girlfriend should have discussed the plan with him first. Even if she had the best intentions, the execution was poor. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
