Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend booked a surprise two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him, using leave that she had arranged with their mutual boss. The author is upset because he didn't want to take an overseas trip and felt she should have asked first. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she shouldn't have made the decision without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip without discussing it with him, which is a problem. The author didn't get a chance to agree or disagree. Using company leave for a trip might be a professional issue, especially since they report to the same boss. The girlfriend didn't consider his preferences\u2014he mentioned preferring to relax and sleep at home. \n\nThe user suggests the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. The main issue here is the lack of communication. The girlfriend made a significant decision without consulting him, which is a red flag in a relationship. While the trip is a surprise and shows thoughtfulness, the author's right to make decisions about his own time and professional matters is important. The fact that she went to their boss without his knowledge adds another layer of unprofessionalism, which the author is justified in being upset about. \n\nThe friends' reaction that he's ungrateful might not be considering his perspective. Being grateful for the gesture doesn't negate the importance of mutual decision-making in a relationship. The author has valid reasons for declining: professional boundaries and personal preferences. So, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
