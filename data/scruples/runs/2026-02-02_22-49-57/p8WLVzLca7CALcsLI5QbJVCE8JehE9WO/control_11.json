Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation, paid for by her, and arranged with their mutual boss. The author didn't like the idea because it's unprofessional to use their boss for couples' leave and also because she didn't ask him first. He refused to go, and now she's annoyed, and his friends think he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to give a surprise, which can be a nice gesture. She went to the trouble of organizing it, maybe spent a lot of money, and involved their boss. But the author has valid points too. He might feel that his autonomy in how to use his vacation time is being overridden. Also, coordinating leave through a boss without consulting him could be seen as unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments under the same boss. That could create problems at work, which he's right to be concerned about.\n\nThe key issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to go on the trip, which is a big deal. Vacation time is personal, and how someone chooses to use it is their choice. By not consulting him, she made a decision for him, even though she paid for it. The author has the right to prefer relaxing and sleeping over traveling. The girlfriend's action, while well-meaning, disregarded his preferences, which is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something nice and was excited to surprise him. But the method she used\u2014bypassing the author's input and involving their boss without his knowledge\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author's refusal is his right, as it's his time off. His friends saying he's ungrateful don't consider that he's standing up for his personal boundaries. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has a legitimate reason to decline based on professional concerns and personal preference. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
