Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by their girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland. She went to their boss in advance to secure the leave without consulting the author. The author is upset because they didn't agree to use their leave for a vacation and would prefer to relax and sleep instead. The key points here are the unprofessionalism of approaching their mutual boss for leave without discussion and the lack of prior consent from the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that asking their boss for leave as a couple is unprofessional and could risk their careers. That's a valid concern, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. The girlfriend didn't check with the author first, which is a major red flag. The author feels their autonomy over their leave time is being disregarded. \n\nThe friends are telling the author they're ungrateful, but the author's main issue is the lack of consultation. The girlfriend paid for everything, but that doesn't mean the author should feel obligated to go. The author's preference is to use the time to rest, which is a personal choice. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, the girlfriend's actions were overstepping. She made a significant decision for both of them without discussion. While surprising someone can be nice, it's important to respect their autonomy, especially when it involves work-related commitments. The author's refusal isn't about the gift itself but the method used to arrange it. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to be upset about how the leave was handled. The girlfriend's actions were intrusive and unprofessional, and the author is justified in standing their ground. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
