Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising him with a vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip for his birthday. She coordinated with their boss to get leave approved for both of them. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to take a vacation to Switzerland. He feels it's unprofessional to take couples' leave and prefers to use his time off for relaxing and sleeping. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend made a generous gesture, which took effort and coordination. She might have thought it would be a nice surprise and that he would appreciate it. However, the author's main issue is that she didn't communicate with him about it first. He has valid concerns about professionalism and his personal preferences. Taking time off for a trip he didn't agree to could be a problem, especially since they work for the same company. Also, using leave without prior discussion might affect their jobs, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned, but she overlooked his potential objections. The decision to take leave is a personal one, and not consulting him could be seen as overstepping. The author is within his rights to refuse if he doesn't want to use his vacation that way. His friends might argue that he should be grateful, but respecting each other's boundaries is important in a relationship. The fact that he's worried about cancellation fees doesn't negate his right to make the choice. \n\nSo, balancing the girlfriend's intentions with the author's valid concerns, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong. He had the right to express his preferences and set boundaries. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first to ensure it was something they both wanted. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
