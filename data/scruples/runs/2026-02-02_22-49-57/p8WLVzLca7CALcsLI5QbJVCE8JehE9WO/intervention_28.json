Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for refusing a surprise vacation their girlfriend paid for.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland using their leave time. She approached their mutual boss months in advance without consulting the author. The author feels this is unprofessional and could affect their careers. They also didn't like the idea of using their leave for an overseas trip and prefer to relax at home.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and communication. The girlfriend made decisions without discussing them with the author. Even though she paid for it, the decision to use their leave should involve both parties. The author has a right to prefer how they spend their time off, and the surprise nature of the trip might have been a way for the girlfriend to assert control without considering his preferences.\n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude isn't the same as obligation. It's reasonable to want to have a say in how your own leave is used. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially without discussing it first. The fact that she went to their boss without his knowledge adds to the unprofessional aspect from his perspective.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing his preferences. The girlfriend should have communicated better. Answer B.\n"
