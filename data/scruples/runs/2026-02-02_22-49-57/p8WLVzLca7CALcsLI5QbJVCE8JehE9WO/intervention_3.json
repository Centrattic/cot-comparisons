Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who refused a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend is in the wrong. The author is considering the situation where his girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him, using their boss's approval which he finds unprofessional.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized the trip without asking him. The author feels that using company leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. He's also annoyed that she didn't check with him first, as he prefers to relax at home. The girlfriend has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, so returning the tickets isn't feasible. He told her he's unhappy because she didn't ask first, and now she's upset. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: He has valid concerns. Using company leave without discussing it with the employee might be seen as overstepping, especially if it's for a personal trip. The fact that she didn't consult him is a key point. The author's main issue is that the decision was made without his input, which is a significant factor. He's not rejecting the gesture outright, just the method. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to plan a surprise, which can be a nice gesture. However, the execution involved using company resources in a way that could be seen as unprofessional. The author's refusal is based on practical concerns and personal preferences, which are legitimate. \n\nThe friends' opinion that he's being ungrateful might be missing the point. Gratitude is important, but so is respecting one's autonomy in personal decisions, especially when it involves work-related leave. The author's stance isn't about the money spent but about the lack of consultation and potential professional risks.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for having these concerns. However, the way he communicated his refusal might have been abrupt, leading to her annoyance. But the core issue is her arranging something without his input, which is where the fault lies. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
