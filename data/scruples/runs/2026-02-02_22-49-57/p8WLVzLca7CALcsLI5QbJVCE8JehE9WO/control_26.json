Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland. She arranged it by talking to their mutual boss months in advance without telling him. The author is upset because he didn't agree to this, and he feels it's unprofessional. He mentions that he prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep instead of traveling overseas. He refused to go, and now his girlfriend is upset. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend made a surprise trip without consulting him, used their boss to arrange time off without the author's input, and he's refusing to go because of personal preference. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasons for refusing are that he didn't have a say in the planning, he's concerned about professionalism, and he doesn't want to travel. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's a surprise, and she paid for everything. The friends think he should be grateful.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author acted unreasonably. The girlfriend did make a big decision without consulting him, which is a valid issue in a relationship. Planning a two-week trip without asking if he wants to go is a major thing. The author's right to set boundaries about his time off and his preferences is important. Also, using their boss to arrange this could be seen as unprofessional, which the author is justified in being concerned about.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was a nice gesture, but she didn't consider his feelings or preferences. The author's refusal isn't about the money spent but about the lack of communication and the potential professional repercussions. His friends saying he's ungrateful might not take into account that the problem is about consent and communication, not the gift itself.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the girlfriend should have asked first. The author's refusal isn't inconsiderate; he's standing by his own preferences and the professional implications. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
