Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation arranged by his girlfriend. The key points here are about consent, communication, and professional boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized the trip without consulting the author. That's a big deal. Even though it's a surprise and a nice gesture, the author didn't get a say in it. Using vacation time is a personal decision, especially when it involves international travel. The author's concern about professionalism is valid because coordinating leave across different departments might indeed be unprofessional if not done properly. Plus, the author prefers to use his leave for relaxing and sleeping, which is a personal preference he didn't get to express.\n\nThe girlfriend did talk to their boss in advance, but that doesn't negate the fact that she didn't ask the author. The author's main issue isn't about the cost or the trip itself but the lack of consultation. The friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the point. Gratitude is one thing, but respecting personal choices and boundaries is another. The author's response about not being enthusiastic because of the lack of communication makes sense. He's standing up for his own needs and preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was good. She wanted to celebrate his birthday and surprise him with a special trip. But intentions don't always override the need for mutual consent in decisions that affect both people. The author isn't rejecting the gesture itself but the method of how it was arranged. So, the core issue is about communication and respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel their opinions are valued. If the girlfriend had discussed the trip with him first, he might have been more receptive. By not doing so, she may have overstepped, even if with good intentions. The author's stance is about asserting his personal preferences and ensuring that decisions affecting him are made with his input. That's a valid position. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
