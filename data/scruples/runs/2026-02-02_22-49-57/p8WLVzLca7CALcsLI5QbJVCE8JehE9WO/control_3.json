Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for his birthday, paid for it, and got the boss's approval without asking him. He didn't want to go because he didn't like the idea of using his leave for an overseas trip and preferred to relax at home. He told her he wouldn't go because she didn't ask him first, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's intent was to do something nice, maybe as a grand gesture for his birthday. She went ahead and made the plans, maybe thinking he would like it. But the author is upset because she didn't consult him. He has valid reasons: he didn't want to use his leave for a trip, he's concerned about professional boundaries by getting the boss involved, and he might prefer his own way to spend time off.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend surprised him, which can be nice, but making big decisions about someone else's time and professional matters without their input is problematic. Even if her intention was good, the method might be flawed. The author has the right to his own schedule and preferences. Using company leave for a vacation is a personal decision, and having the boss involved without his knowledge could indeed affect his career, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being thoughtful and planning something he would enjoy. Her friends might say he's ungrateful, but that's not necessarily the case. He's expressing his discomfort with the situation and standing by his choice. He's not rejecting the gesture entirely but is firm in his decision because of the lack of communication and the professional implications.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's being ungrateful, maybe. But considering the lack of communication and the potential professional risks, he's justified in his refusal. The main issue is that the girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a key part of respecting each other's boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for wanting to set that boundary.\n"
