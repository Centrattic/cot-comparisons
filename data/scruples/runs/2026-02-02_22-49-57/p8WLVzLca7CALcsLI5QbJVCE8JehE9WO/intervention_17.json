Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the author's birthday, paid for everything, and arranged with their mutual boss without asking the author. The author didn't want to go because he prefers to relax at home, and he's upset that she didn't consult him first. Friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she overstepped.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend did a big favor, but without the author's input. The author feels that his preferences matter, especially regarding using his leave. The boss was involved, which could be a problem if it's unprofessional, but that's more about the girlfriend's actions. The author's main issue is not being asked. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and preferences. Even if the intention is good, making a big decision without discussion can be problematic. The author's reasons for not wanting to go are valid\u2014personal preference, potential career impact if the leave request is seen as unprofessional. The girlfriend might have meant well, but she didn't consider his feelings or ask for his opinion. \n\nThe friends' opinion that he's ungrateful might not take into account that the surprise was planned without his consent. Gratitude is about appreciation, but that doesn't mean you have to do something you don't want to do. The author's right to say no is important. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, and he has a right to his own preferences. The fact that she already paid doesn't negate the need for mutual agreement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
