Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is the girlfriend surprised the author with a vacation to Switzerland. She arranged the flights and talked to their mutual boss to get time off without consulting him. The author is upset because he didn't agree to it and thinks she should have asked. He prefers to use his leave for relaxing and sleeping. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she overstepped.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend did plan a surprise, which is a common gesture. But she went against the author's autonomy by not asking. The key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't have a say in the matter, which is a problem. Even if she thought it was a nice gesture, using company leave without his input could be an issue. Also, the author's discomfort about using time off for travel is valid. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend did pay for everything, and he's worried about cancellation fees. However, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for refusing. The author's friends think he's ungrateful, but the girlfriend didn't get his consent. So, the author's right to decide how to use his leave is important. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's actions might stem from good intentions, but she overstepped by not consulting him. The author is justified in feeling that his autonomy was disregarded. \n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might have thought it was a nice surprise. But in a healthy relationship, major decisions like using vacation time should be mutual. The author's refusal isn't ungrateful; it's about personal preference and respecting his own needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
