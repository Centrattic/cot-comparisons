Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but the guy is upset because she didn't consult him and involved their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip, talked to their boss without asking him first. The author is upset about the unprofessionalism of asking their boss for couple's leave, and also because he didn't get a say in using his leave. He prefers to relax and sleep instead of traveling. He's being called ungrateful by his friends, but he feels she should have asked him first.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent and unprofessional behavior. Did the girlfriend overstep by arranging time off without his input? Also, is it unprofessional for her to talk to their boss about this? Since they're in different departments but under the same boss, maybe the boss didn't realize the implications. The author is worried about his career impact. \n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer for AITA (Am I the Asshole). The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were a surprise. Some people might see that as thoughtful, but others might see it as disregarding the partner's preferences. The author had a valid reason to be upset: not being asked, the unprofessionalism, potential career risks. His friends are telling him he's ungrateful, but maybe they're missing the point. The girlfriend did ask the boss without permission, which could be a problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making plans. So the author's stance that she should have asked first is reasonable. Her actions might have been well-intentioned but careless. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his right to make decisions about his own time and career. The girlfriend's surprise was a mistake here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
