Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, which she paid for. She talked to their boss months in advance without the author's knowledge. The author felt that arranging leave for a couples' trip is unprofessional and could harm their career. Also, the author didn't want to use their leave for an overseas trip, preferring to relax and sleep instead.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask the author if they wanted to go on the trip or use their leave for it. She made decisions without consulting him, which is a key issue. The author's job in IT might be different from HR, but both are under the same boss, so coordinating leave without discussion could be problematic. The author has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preferences. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to make the author happy, and she went to great lengths to plan the trip. However, respecting the partner's autonomy and preferences is crucial. The author's refusal isn't about the gift itself but about the lack of communication and consent. \n\nClose friends say the author is being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean agreeing to something against one's will. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. The girlfriend's actions were well-meaning but overstepped by not seeking the author's input. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
