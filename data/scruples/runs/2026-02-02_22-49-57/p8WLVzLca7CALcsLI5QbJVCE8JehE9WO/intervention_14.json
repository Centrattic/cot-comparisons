Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything including flights and ski resorts. She told him she talked to their boss months in advance without his knowledge. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, didn't consider his preferences, and he's worried about the professionalism of asking their boss for couple's leave. He prefers to relax and sleep during his leave instead of traveling. He told her he would refuse to go because she didn't ask, and now she's annoyed. His friends think he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the girlfriend overstepped. She made a big decision without consulting him, which is a major trip. Even though she paid for everything, the fact that she arranged it without his input is a problem. Communication is key in relationships, and making such a big plan without discussing it could be seen as dismissive of his preferences. Also, using their boss for leave without his knowledge might be a professional risk he wasn't aware of. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to make his birthday special. She went to the effort of planning and paying for the trip, which is a generous gesture. The author's reaction might be seen as ungrateful if he didn't express his preferences beforehand. However, the fact that she didn't check with him first is a significant issue. People have different ideas about how to spend their time off, and he should be able to voice that. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Even if the trip was a surprise, the author's autonomy in deciding how to use his leave is important. The girlfriend's method of arranging it without his input could be seen as controlling or not respecting his wishes. The author is justified in feeling that his preferences were ignored, especially since he mentioned he would prefer to relax.\n\nHis friends' reaction that he's being ungrateful is a common perspective, but it's also possible they're not considering the communication aspect. The girlfriend's approach might have been well-intentioned, but the lack of discussion is a red flag. The author's refusal isn't about the trip itself but about the lack of consultation. \n\nIn terms of professional concerns, the girlfriend talking to their boss without his knowledge could indeed be problematic if it leads to any issues at work. The author is right to be worried about how this might affect his career, and that adds to the justification for his refusal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has valid reasons for his refusal, especially since the trip was planned without his input and might conflict with his personal preferences and professional concerns. The girlfriend's mistake was not discussing the trip with him first. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
