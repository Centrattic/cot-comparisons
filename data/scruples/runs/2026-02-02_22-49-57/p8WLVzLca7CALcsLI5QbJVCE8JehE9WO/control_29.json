Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She talked to their boss months in advance to arrange the leave without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he's concerned about the professionalism of her talking to their boss about taking leave for a couples' trip. He also prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep instead of traveling.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) did the girlfriend overstep by making the plans without consulting him, and 2) is the author justified in refusing the trip because of that?\n\nThe girlfriend's intentions might have been good, wanting to give him a surprise birthday gift. But she did make a significant decision that affects his personal time without his input. Taking leave for an overseas trip is a big deal, especially in a professional context. The author has valid concerns about the unprofessionalism of his boss being involved without his knowledge, which could affect his career. Also, personal preferences matter\u2014he doesn't want to travel and would rather rest. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being thoughtful by arranging everything, but she didn't consider his personal preferences. The friends think he's ungrateful, but the author's reasons are about control over his own time and professional boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own boundaries and preferences, which is reasonable. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. The author isn't rejecting the gesture out of spite but because of valid concerns. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
