Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, which she paid for, and she went to their boss without the author's knowledge to get the time off. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, and he doesn't want to take an overseas trip. He's worried about the professional implications and personal preferences.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Communication and Consent**: The girlfriend made a significant decision without discussing it with him. Even though it's a surprise and a gift, major plans like extended travel should involve the other person's input. The author's preference to relax at home isn't respected here.\n\n2. **Professional Risks**: Coordinating leave with a shared boss without the employee's knowledge could be seen as unprofessional, especially if it's not standard. The author is concerned about potential career impacts, which is a valid point.\n\n3. **Financial Responsibility**: The girlfriend has already paid for everything, including non-refundable bookings. The author is conflicted because returning the tickets would cost her money, but he still feels it's her responsibility to have checked with him first.\n\n4. **Gratitude vs. Autonomy**: Friends say he's ungrateful for not going, but the argument is about respecting personal boundaries. The author isn't rejecting the gesture, just the method and lack of communication.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but the execution overlooked the author's preferences and autonomy. The author's refusal isn't about the gift itself but the lack of prior discussion. Since the trip was a surprise without consultation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for declining. He's asserting his right to have a say in his own time and plans. The girlfriend's actions, while well-meaning, may have been overreaching. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
