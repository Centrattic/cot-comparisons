Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, bought the tickets, and arranged with their boss. The guy didn't know about it until his birthday. He's upset because she didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to go on an overseas trip. He's worried about professional issues and prefers to relax at home. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) She organized the trip without consulting him, 2) She involved their boss in the surprise, which he feels is unprofessional, and 3) He would rather use his leave for personal relaxation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect in relationships. In a healthy relationship, major decisions, especially those involving personal time and work commitments, should be discussed. The girlfriend didn't check with him, which might be seen as disregarding his preferences. Using their boss to keep it a secret could also create workplace tension, especially since they're in the same company. The author's concerns about professionalism and personal preference seem valid. His friends' reaction suggests that some might think he's being ungrateful, but the key issue is consent and communication. Since the trip was a surprise and not discussed beforehand, the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. He has a right to his own preferences and to voice his discomfort. The girlfriend's approach might have been well-intentioned but lacked communication. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
