Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation paid for by her, but the author refused to go. The key points here are that the girlfriend arranged the trip without consulting him, used their boss (they both work at the same company) to get time off, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. He's in IT, she's in HR, different branches but same boss. He's annoyed because she approached their boss for leave without his input, which he sees as unprofessional. He also didn't like that she didn't ask him first. He would prefer to use his time off to relax and sleep, not travel. The girlfriend paid for everything, so returning the tickets might cost her money.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to plan a surprise for his birthday. She did check with their boss, but he's upset that she didn't consult him. The friends say he's being ungrateful. The question is whether he's wrong for refusing.\n\nLooking at the situation from both sides. The girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned but perhaps overstepped by not discussing the trip with him. The author has valid concerns about professional boundaries and personal preferences. He has the right to decide how he uses his leave. The girlfriend should have asked him first, so the author isn't wrong to voice his discomfort. It's about consent and respecting personal choices. The author's refusal isn't about being ungrateful but about his own preferences and the potential professional implications. So he's not in the wrong.\n"
