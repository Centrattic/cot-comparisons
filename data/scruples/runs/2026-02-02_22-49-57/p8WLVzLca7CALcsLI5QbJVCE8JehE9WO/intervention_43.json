Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland. She arranged it without consulting him, even talking to their boss in advance. He's upset because he didn't want to go on an overseas trip and thinks she should have asked first. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he feels she overstepped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is consent. Did the girlfriend overstep by making a decision that affects him without his input? The author is clear he prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. Using company leave for a trip without discussing it could be a problem, especially since they work under the same boss. There's also the unprofessional aspect of their boss being involved in a personal matter.\n\nThe girlfriend did spend money she couldn't get back, which complicates things. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to go. He has the right to his preferences. The surprise might have been well-meaning, but respecting his autonomy is important. Friends saying he's ungrateful might not see the lack of communication here. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
