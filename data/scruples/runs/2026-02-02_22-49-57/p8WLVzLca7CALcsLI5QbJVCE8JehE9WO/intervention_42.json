Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, which the author refuses because he feels it was unprofessional to approach their boss without consulting him first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized a surprise trip, using both of their leave time. She didn't talk to the author first, just told him after the fact. The author is upset because the girlfriend went behind his back to get his boss's approval, which he thinks is unprofessional. He also didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip, preferring to relax at home. The friends are telling him he's ungrateful. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is two-fold: professional concerns about how the leave was requested and personal preferences about vacationing. From a relationship perspective, the girlfriend made a significant decision without consulting him, which is a big deal because it's about their time off and involves work. The author has valid points about not being consulted and the unprofessional aspect of informing their boss without his knowledge. The girlfriend's actions might have overstepped, especially if the author didn't want to take such a trip.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the girlfriend was trying to be thoughtful and create a memorable experience, which is a nice gesture. But the key here is mutual respect and communication. In a healthy relationship, both partners should discuss and agree on major plans that affect each other's work and personal time. The girlfriend not checking in with him is a misstep. The author has the right to set boundaries about how his leave is used, especially if he's not interested in traveling overseas.\n\nThe friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the point. The problem isn't about being ungrateful for the gift but about the method and lack of consent in arranging such a significant trip. The author isn't rejecting the gesture itself but the way it was handled. So, the author is justified in his feelings and decision to decline, especially considering the potential professional repercussions and personal preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend failed to communicate and respect his autonomy regarding his leave and personal preferences. The decision to decline the trip is a valid response to these issues.\n"
