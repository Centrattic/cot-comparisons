Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is that the author's girlfriend surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go because she didn't ask him first and he's uncomfortable with taking couples' leave from their mutual boss. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized a two-week trip without consulting him, used company leave which could be unprofessional since they report to the same boss. The author didn't ask for leave for an overseas trip, and he's not interested in using his vacation for this. He's annoyed because she didn't check with him first. His friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The main issue is communication. The girlfriend tried to do something thoughtful but didn't discuss it with him. The author's concern is about the professional implications\u2014asking for couples' leave might be seen as unprofessional, and he doesn't want to use his vacation for a trip he didn't plan. He also has a valid point about not being consulted, which is a significant relationship issue. Surprises can be nice, but when they involve financial commitments and work decisions, it's important to get the other person's input. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, and the author's refusal might seem like being unappreciative. However, the key here is that the trip involved decisions that affect his work and personal preferences without his consent. It's not just about the trip itself but the lack of communication and the potential professional risk. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and preferences is crucial. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding how he uses his vacation time. The fact that the girlfriend already paid for everything complicates things, but the author's right to say no shouldn't be discounted. \n\nSo, weighing the aspects: the girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, which is a breach of mutual decision-making in a relationship. The author's refusal is based on valid concerns about professionalism and personal preference. His friends might see it as ungrateful, but the root issue is the lack of communication and consideration for his boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't respect his autonomy in this matter.\n"
