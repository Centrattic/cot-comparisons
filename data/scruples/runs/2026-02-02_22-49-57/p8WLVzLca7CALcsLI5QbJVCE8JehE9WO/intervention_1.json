Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, got flights, ski resorts, and told her boss months in advance. The key points here are that she didn't consult him first and that she coordinated with their mutual boss. The author felt it was unprofessional because asking for leave for a couples' trip could be seen as mixing work and personal matters. Also, he didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and preferred to relax at home.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's upset because important decisions about his leave were made without his input. Using company leave for a vacation, especially an overseas one, might not align with his personal preferences. Plus, coordinating with their boss in advance could be a breach of professional boundaries, especially if they work in different departments. He's also concerned about the financial aspect since she's already paid for everything, but he feels it's a personal choice he didn't agree to.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned, but the method might have been flawed. She organized something significant without his consent, which can be seen as overstepping. While surprising someone with a gift is nice, it's important that it respects the other person's autonomy and preferences. The author is standing by his decision because he values his own preferences and professional boundaries, which is valid.\n\nThe friends told him he's ungrateful, but that's subjective. Appreciating the gesture doesn't mean he has to agree with the method. It's about personal values versus the gesture. The author isn't rejecting the trip itself but the manner in which it was arranged without his input. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He has every right to prioritize his own preferences and professional boundaries. The girlfriend could have asked first, and the author's refusal is a valid response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
