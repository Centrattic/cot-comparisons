Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him, even though he works in a different department but under the same boss. She told their boss months in advance to keep it a secret. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he prefers to use his leave for relaxing rather than traveling. His friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend made a big decision without his input, which he didn't like. He's not against traveling but prefers to use his leave for personal relaxation. The key issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend assumed he wanted the trip, but he didn't, so he felt it was his right to say no. \n\nIs it wrong to not go? Well, he did explain his reasons. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping by using company resources (boss's approval) without his knowledge. Also, he's concerned about professional implications, which is valid. The fact that he's not interested in the trip and she didn't check with him first is a problem. \n\nThe friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to accept something you don't want. The girlfriend should have discussed it first. He's in the right to prioritize his own preferences. So, the answer is B.\n"
