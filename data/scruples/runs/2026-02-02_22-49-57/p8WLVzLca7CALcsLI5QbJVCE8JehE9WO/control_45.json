Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author declining a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him, which he's upset about. She paid for it and informed their boss in advance. The author feels that using company leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional and that she should have asked him first. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nImportant factors here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a surprise without his input. Even though she paid for it, the author didn't agree to go. The fact that they work under the same boss adds a layer of unprofessionalism, which the author is concerned about. \n\nHe didn't want to take a long trip, preferring to relax and sleep. His refusal isn't about the cost or the trip itself but about the lack of prior discussion. The girlfriend is annoyed, which might stem from her excitement and effort. \n\nLegally and ethically, he can't be forced to take a trip he didn't agree to. She used company resources (the leave) without his consent. The author's main grievance is about being asked, not the trip itself. The fact that she didn't check in with him first is a key point. \n\nHis friends call him ungrateful, but gratitude isn't about being forced into something. The author is within his rights to decline if he didn't consent. The girlfriend's approach was overstepping by not consulting him. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
