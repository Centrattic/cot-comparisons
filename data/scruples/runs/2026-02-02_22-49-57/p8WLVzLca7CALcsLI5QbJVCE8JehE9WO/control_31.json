Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend organizing a surprise vacation paid for by her, but the author refused to go because they didn't agree with using their leave for it and felt it was unprofessional to involve their boss without consulting him first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend worked behind the author's back to get two weeks off via their mutual boss, which the author finds unprofessional. The author didn't want to take a vacation in the first place, preferring to relax at home, and felt the trip was a surprise without his consent. The girlfriend paid for everything, so returning the tickets would cause financial loss. The author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nNow, thinking about both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to give a surprise birthday present, which is a common gesture. However, she didn't consult him about the trip or how to use his leave. The author has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preferences. Using company resources (boss's approval) without the employee's knowledge could be problematic. Also, the author has the right to decide how he uses his leave time. The girlfriend might have thought she was doing something nice, but she overstepped by not discussing it with him first.\n\nIs the author wrong for refusing? If the trip was a surprise without his consent, he's within his rights to decline. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making arrangements. The author isn't being ungrateful for the gesture, but he's asserting his own preferences and concerns about workplace professionalism. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his own boundaries and preferences, and the girlfriend should have involved him in the decision-making process.\n"
