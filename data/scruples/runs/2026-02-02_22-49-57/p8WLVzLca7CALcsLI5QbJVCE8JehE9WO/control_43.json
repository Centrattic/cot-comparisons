Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland, booked through their mutual boss without the author's knowledge. He's upset because she didn't ask him first and he prefers to relax and sleep during his leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him, which is a big issue. She used their boss to get leave without his input, which he finds unprofessional. The author is not happy with an overseas trip and would have preferred using the time to relax. He's worried about potential career impact by taking couples' leave. His friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, making such a significant decision without the partner's input can be seen as dismissive. The trip is a large commitment, and using work leave without discussing it with the other person is a problem. However, the girlfriend did plan this as a surprise, which might stem from good intentions. But the fact remains that major life decisions, especially involving work and money, should be mutual.\n\nThe author's reasoning is valid. He's concerned about professionalism and his personal preferences. The girlfriend's approach could indeed jeopardize their careers since coordinating leave for both without proper communication could be risky. The author's right to decide how to use his leave is important. Even if the trip was a surprise, it's a surprise that affects both their professional and personal lives.\n\nHis friends saying he's ungrateful might not be considering his perspective. Gratitude is important, but so is respecting personal boundaries and preferences. The author isn't rejecting the gift itself but the manner in which it was given and the implications. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't consult him on a matter that directly affects him.\n"
