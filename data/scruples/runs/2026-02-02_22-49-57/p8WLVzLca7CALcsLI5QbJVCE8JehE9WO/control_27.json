Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for by her, and the author refusing to go because she didn't ask him first and he's uncomfortable with using his leave for an overseas trip. They work in the same company but different branches, and the girlfriend talked to their boss without the author's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip without discussing it with him. She used their mutual boss, which might be a problem because coordinating leave through a boss without the employee's input could be seen as overstepping. The author is upset because he values his leave time for relaxation and didn't agree to the trip. He also mentions that asking for couples' leave could be unprofessional and risk his career.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that it's a surprise and she's trying to be romantic. However, the author's main issue is the lack of consent and the potential professional repercussions. Friends say he's ungrateful, but the author is standing by his decision because he wasn't consulted. The girlfriend did pay for everything, but the author doesn't want to go. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend's intention was good, but she didn't consider his preferences or the professional implications. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons: personal preference for his leave and professional boundaries. He didn't act out of spite but out of principle. The girlfriend could have asked him instead of assuming he wanted the trip. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he has the right to decide how he uses his leave time. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
