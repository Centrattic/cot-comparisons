Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend. The situation involves some key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland. She didn't consult the author and went straight to their mutual boss to secure leave months in advance. The author feels that this was unprofessional because she didn't ask him first. He prefers to use his leave time to relax at home, not travel. He's also worried about the unprofessionalism of the couple's leave request affecting his career. Friends are saying he's being ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nThe main issue here is whether not consulting the partner about such a significant decision is acceptable. The girlfriend's action was a surprise, which might be seen as a gesture of love, but it was done without considering the partner's preferences and without communication. The author's refusal is based on personal preference and professional concerns. \n\nIn relationships, important decisions, especially those affecting both partners' work and personal lives, should ideally be discussed. The girlfriend's decision to go behind the author's back and involve their boss without his input could be seen as overstepping. The author's right to his own time and how he chooses to spend it is valid. While the surprise might have been well-intentioned, the lack of communication and consideration for his wishes is where the problem lies. The friends' advice might be coming from a place of wanting him to appreciate the gesture, but the author's stance is about his own comfort and professional boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He has legitimate reasons to refuse, based on both personal preference and professional concerns. The girlfriend's actions, while kind, were done without proper consultation, which is a key factor here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
