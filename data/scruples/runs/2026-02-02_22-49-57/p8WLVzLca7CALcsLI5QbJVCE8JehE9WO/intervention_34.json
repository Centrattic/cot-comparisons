Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she arranged it without asking him and involved their mutual boss, which he thinks is unprofessional.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend planned a surprise, which she intended as a nice gesture for his birthday. She went through their boss to secure the leave, which the author finds unprofessional. He's not happy because he would have preferred to use his leave time to relax at home, not travel. Also, he's annoyed that she didn't consult him first. The friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nOn the other hand, surprising someone with a vacation can be a thoughtful act. The girlfriend might have thought it would be a great experience and didn't realize he preferred a different way to spend his time. However, there's a key point here: she didn't ask him. Even if the gesture is good, the lack of communication is a problem. He has a valid reason to be upset because using company leave for personal travel without discussing it with the partner could indeed be seen as unprofessional, especially in the same company, which might create conflicts.\n\nThe author's main concerns are professional and personal. Professionally, he's worried about asking for leave and how that might affect his career. He didn't have a say in that. Personally, he doesn't want to use his time off for an overseas trip. Since the tickets are already paid for, he's in a bind, but he still feels it's his right to decide how to use his vacation time. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the lack of communication is a big issue. She should have discussed the plans with him before making any decisions, especially involving work. The fact that she went to their boss without his knowledge adds another layer of concern because it could be seen as manipulating his work schedule without his input.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He has legitimate reasons to be upset about the unprofessional approach and the lack of consultation. While the surprise was meant to be nice, the execution had problems. Therefore, the answer is B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
