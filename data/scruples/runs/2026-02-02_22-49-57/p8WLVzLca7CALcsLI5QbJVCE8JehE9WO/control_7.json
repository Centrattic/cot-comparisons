Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a surprise trip to Switzerland for his birthday. She got the boss's approval in advance, but the author is upset because she didn't ask him first. He feels that using company leave for an overseas trip could be unprofessional and might affect his career. Also, he prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he's standing by his decision. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend did plan the trip without consulting him, which is a big deal. Even though she paid for it and got the boss's okay, the author's preference and comfort are important. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries and preferences. By not asking him first, she may have overstepped, especially since using vacation time is a personal choice. The fact that he's in a different department but same boss adds a layer of potential professional risk, which he's rightly concerned about.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to give a thoughtful gift. However, the method was flawed. Gifts are nice, but they should still consider the recipient's wishes and needs. The author had legitimate reasons to be upset. His friends calling him ungrateful might not be fair because he's not rejecting the gesture itself, but the lack of communication and the potential professional implications.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for standing up for his boundaries. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making plans, especially something as significant as a two-week overseas trip using his leave. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
