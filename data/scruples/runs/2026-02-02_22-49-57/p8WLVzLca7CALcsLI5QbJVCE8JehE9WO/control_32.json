Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go because she didn't ask him first and he didn't want to take that time off. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him, used their boss to arrange leave without his input, and he feels it's unprofessional. He prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep. She's upset because he's not excited and he told her he would refuse to go. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent, communication, and professional boundaries. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with him, which is a significant commitment. Even though she paid for everything, the fact that she didn't ask could be a red flag. Using their mutual boss to arrange leave without his knowledge might come off as unprofessional, which he's validly concerned about. His preference to use the time differently is his personal choice, and he's standing his ground on that.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something nice, but maybe she overstepped by not checking with him first. The friends' reaction that he's ungrateful might be missing the point that his main issue is the lack of consultation, not the trip itself. \n\nSo, is he wrong for refusing? I think not. He has the right to his own preferences regarding vacation time. The girlfriend's approach was flawed because she didn't communicate with him, which is a key part of any relationship. His refusal is based on valid concerns about professionalism and personal choice. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
