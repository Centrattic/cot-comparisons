Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and got leave approved from their mutual boss without consulting him. The author is upset because it's unprofessional to ask their boss for couple's leave and he didn't want to go on an overseas trip. He prefers to relax and sleep instead.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without checking with him, which is a problem. Even though it was a surprise, the author has legitimate concerns about professionalism and his personal preferences. He's not happy that she went behind his back to get leave, which could risk their jobs. Also, using his leave time without his input is a big deal. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend probably did this out of love and thoughtfulness. She wanted to make his birthday special. But the key issue is that she didn't ask him first. The author has every right to feel that his autonomy was disregarded, especially when it comes to work-related decisions. \n\nHis friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean he has to accept something that makes him uncomfortable. The fact that he's worried about professional implications and personal preferences matters. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. He's standing up for his own needs and concerns, which is valid. The girlfriend should have discussed this with him before making such significant plans. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
