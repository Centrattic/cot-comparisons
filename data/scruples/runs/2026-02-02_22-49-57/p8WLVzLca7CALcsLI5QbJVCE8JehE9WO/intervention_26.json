Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend, and he's refusing to go because she didn't ask him and used their boss to get the leave.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without his input. She told their boss months in advance to keep it a secret. He's upset because using couples' leave might be unprofessional and could affect his career. He didn't want to go overseas and preferred to relax at home. He told her he's refusing because she should have asked him first, and now she's annoyed, and friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend did something thoughtful and surprising, which he might have not expected. She went through the trouble of booking everything and even coordinating with their boss. Her intention was to make his birthday special. Friends might say he's being ungrateful because she made a big effort and he's not appreciating it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns. He didn't agree to the trip, and using company leave for a personal trip without his consent could be problematic. He's worried about professionalism and his career. Also, personal preferences matter; he would rather relax than travel. The girlfriend didn't check with him, which shows a lack of communication. The author's right to make decisions about his own time is important here.\n\nThe girlfriend's approach might have been well-meaning, but respecting each other's boundaries is crucial in a relationship. By not discussing it first, she potentially overstepped. The author's decision to decline is about his autonomy and career concerns, which are significant factors.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his own boundaries and concerns. The girlfriend's actions, while thoughtful, didn't consider his preferences and the potential professional implications. The key issue is consent and communication. The author isn't obligated to accept a surprise that doesn't align with his wishes, even if it's a gift.\n"
