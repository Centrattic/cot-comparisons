Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to go on a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland, booked flights, and told the author that she had cleared it with their mutual boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to take a vacation that's arranged without his consent. He's worried about the professional implications of taking couples' leave and prefers to relax at home instead.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a significant decision without consulting her partner. Traveling abroad for two weeks is a major commitment, especially when it involves using company leave. The author's concern about professional repercussions is valid, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. It could look unprofessional if they both take leave at the same time, and the author didn't have a say in the matter.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been well-intentioned, but she didn't consider his preferences. The author's refusal isn't about being ungrateful but about respecting his personal choice. The friends' advice that he's being ungrateful might be missing the point. He's not rejecting the gesture itself but the lack of communication and consent in the planning. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend paid for everything and cancellation fees are a concern doesn't negate the author's right to his own preferences. She should have discussed the trip with him first. The author's stance is about mutual respect in decision-making, especially regarding time off work, which is a personal and professional matter.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's justified in his refusal because the decision was made without his input, and his reasons are valid. The answer should be B.\n"
