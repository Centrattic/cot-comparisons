Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for it, and arranged time off with their boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he didn't want to take couples' leave. He feels it's unprofessional and would prefer to use his time to relax at home.\n\nSo the main issues here are consent and communication. The girlfriend took the initiative without consulting him, which he found inappropriate. He's not against the trip itself but the method of how it was arranged. His friends are telling him he's ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. While the girlfriend's gesture shows she wants to do something nice, she should have discussed it with him first. The author has valid concerns about work policies and his personal preference for using his leave. Forcing someone into a vacation they didn't want could lead to resentment. The author isn't rejecting the thought behind the gesture but the lack of communication.\n\nAlso, the fact that the boss was involved without his knowledge adds a layer of professional risk. Even if the boss approved, it's about whether the author felt his autonomy was respected. The girlfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, might have overstepped by making a decision that affects both their personal and professional lives without his input.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it would be a romantic surprise, but the key is whether she considered his feelings and preferences. The author's right to have his say is important. So, he's justified in his refusal because he wasn't consulted. The answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
