Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for by her, and got leave approval from their boss without consulting him. He's upset because he didn't agree to it and would rather not go on an overseas trip, preferring to relax at home. His friends say he's ungrateful, but the user thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned this without discussing it with him, even though it involves his leave time. She went to their boss, which might be unprofessional since they're in different departments. The author's main issue is that she didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to travel. He's worried about career implications and personal preference. \n\nHe didn't agree to the trip, which is a major decision affecting his time off. The girlfriend paid for everything, including cancellations if she refunds, but that doesn't mean he's obligated to go. The fact that she didn't consult him is a problem because it's his leave and his personal choice. His friends calling him ungrateful might be missing the point\u2014he's not refusing a gift, he's objecting to the lack of consultation and the imposition on his time. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to create a nice surprise. But respecting each other's boundaries is important in any relationship. If he clearly stated his preference not to go, then she should have respected that. The surprise might have been well-meaning, but the execution ignored his autonomy. \n\nThe author's concern about professional boundaries is valid. Asking a shared boss for leave for a couple's trip could be seen as inappropriate. Also, using leave without prior discussion with the employee is questionable. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping by making decisions that affect him without his input. \n\nIn a relationship, mutual respect and communication are key. While surprises can be nice, they shouldn't override the other person's preferences. The girlfriend might have wanted to do something special, but she didn't consider his feelings or preferences. The author isn't wrong to express his dissatisfaction and decline the trip. He's asserting his right to decide how to use his vacation time. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is justified in his decision. He's not being ungrateful; he's standing up for his personal choice and professional concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
