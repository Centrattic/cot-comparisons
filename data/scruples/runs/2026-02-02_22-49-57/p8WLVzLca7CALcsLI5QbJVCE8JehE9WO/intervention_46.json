Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author's girlfriend surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he refused because she didn't ask him and involved their boss without his consent. The key points are: she arranged it without consulting him, used their mutual boss, and he feels it's unprofessional and against his preference to relax at home.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. The girlfriend did things without his input, which is a problem. She made a big decision that affects him, which he didn't agree to. Also, using their boss to coordinate leave without his knowledge could be a red flag, especially in their work context. \n\nThe author's reasons for refusing are valid: he doesn't want to travel overseas, prefers to relax, and the arrangement could affect his career. Friends say he's ungrateful, but the main issue is consent and communication. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. So the author isn't wrong for objecting. \n\nBut maybe some people would say he should be more appreciative of the gesture. However, the lack of communication is a bigger issue here. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
