Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland for the author's birthday. She got the tickets, talked to their boss in advance without the author's knowledge, and paid for everything. The author is upset because they didn't know about this and would prefer to use their leave time to relax and sleep instead of going on an overseas trip. The author refused to go, which made the girlfriend annoyed, and friends are saying he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the girlfriend overstepped. She did plan this without consulting him, even though it uses his vacation time. Using company leave for a trip without discussing it with him first might be an issue. Also, mentioning that she told their boss without his knowledge could be a concern, especially since they work for the same company. The author is worried about professionalism and potential career impact. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being thoughtful and generous. She went to the trouble of planning a surprise, which can be a nice gesture. But the key point here is consent and communication. The author's vacation time is his to manage, and the girlfriend didn't check with him before making the plans. That's a problem because it's about respecting his autonomy.\n\nThe author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but maybe they're missing the point. The issue isn't about not appreciating the gift but about the lack of communication and using his leave without his input. The author's reasons for not wanting to go (preferring to relax and sleep) are valid. He has the right to decide how to use his own leave time. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend might face cancellation fees is a consequence of her decision, but that's her responsibility. The main issue is whether she should have involved him in the planning. Since she didn't, and he's within his rights to refuse, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend didn't seek his consent, and he's justified in not wanting to use his leave as planned without discussing it first.\n"
