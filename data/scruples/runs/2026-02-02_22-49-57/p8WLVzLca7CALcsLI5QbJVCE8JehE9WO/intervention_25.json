Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland, booked flights and ski resorts, without consulting him. She informed their boss months in advance to secure the leave, which is a problem because they work in different departments but report to the same boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep instead of traveling. He refused, and she's now annoyed, while friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, which is a significant issue. Using company leave for a trip without discussing it with the partner could be a problem, especially if the partner has different plans. Also, informing the boss without the partner's knowledge might be unprofessional, as the author pointed out. \n\nThe girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but the method was flawed. She assumed he would want to go, which he didn't. The author has a valid reason to be upset because his preferences were ignored. The friends' advice to just go because he's ungrateful might be missing the point. The issue isn't about being ungrateful for the trip itself but about the lack of consultation and the potential professional risks.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend overstepped by making decisions without his input, especially involving their workplace. The fact that he's concerned about professional repercussions is another valid point. So the answer should be B.\n"
