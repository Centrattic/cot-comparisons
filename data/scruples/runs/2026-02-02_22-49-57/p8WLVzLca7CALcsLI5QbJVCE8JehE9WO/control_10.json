Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but the author is upset because she didn't consult him and involved their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend organized the trip without asking the author, used their boss (who oversees both of them) to arrange leave, and paid for everything. The author didn't agree with taking time off for an overseas trip and prefers relaxing at home. He refused, which upset her, and now friends are saying he's being ungrateful. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he feels that using company leave for a vacation without his input is unprofessional and could harm his career. Also, he values his personal time and wants to use it differently. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel she was showing love and effort by planning a surprise, expecting him to be happy. \n\nThe main issues here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a decision that affects the author without discussing it with him. Even if her intentions were good, not consulting him about using his leave is a problem. The author's refusal is about asserting his preferences and boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. While surprises can be nice, they shouldn't infringe on someone else's personal choices without discussion. The author isn't rejecting the gesture itself but the method of arranging it without his input. His friends' criticism might be missing the point about the lack of communication rather than the refusal itself.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his preferences and the proper way to handle leave. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
