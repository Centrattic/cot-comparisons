Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising the author with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't ask him first and involved their boss without his knowledge.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him. She used her position in HR to talk to their boss, which could be seen as overstepping. The author feels that taking leave for an overseas trip is a big decision that requires his input, and he prefers to use his leave for relaxation at home. He's also concerned about the professional implications for both of them if their boss is involved in personal leave arrangements.\n\nThe girlfriend paid for everything, so returning the tickets is an issue due to cancellation fees. The author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but the key point here is whether the girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making plans. Since he didn't know about it and it's a significant commitment, he's justified in feeling that his autonomy was overlooked. \n\nProfessionally, having HR handle leave for a trip without the employee's consent could be problematic. The author's refusal isn't just about the trip itself but also about respecting his decision-making authority. The girlfriend's actions might have been well-intentioned, but she didn't consider his preferences or the potential career risks. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his right to make personal decisions about his time and how he's treated professionally. The girlfriend should have communicated better and respected his autonomy. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
