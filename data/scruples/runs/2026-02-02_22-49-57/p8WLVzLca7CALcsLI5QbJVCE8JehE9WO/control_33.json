Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but the partner is upset and refuses to go.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized this surprise without consulting him. She talked to their boss in advance to get leave approved. The key points here are that she didn't ask if he wanted to go, she used company leave, which he thinks is unprofessional, and he prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he's standing by his decision.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she did plan this as a surprise, maybe thinking he would love it. She even paid for everything, so there's financial commitment involved. She might feel hurt that he's not excited and that he's refusing after she's already spent money.\n\nBut from the author's side, he didn't get a chance to express his preferences. The surprise aspect might have been nice, but the fact that she didn't ask his opinion is a big issue. He has a valid point about the unprofessionalism of getting leave for a couples' trip, especially since they report to the same boss. Also, using leave without discussing could affect his career, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend had consulted him, maybe he would have agreed. But since she didn't, he's within his right to refuse. His main issue is the lack of communication and consideration for his preferences. However, some might argue that he should be grateful for the gesture and go along with it. But the fact that he's not interested in the trip and has valid reasons (professional and personal) suggests he's justified in his decision.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his right to make decisions about his own time and career. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
