Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is between answer A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nSo, the scenario is that the author's girlfriend surprised them with a paid vacation to Switzerland. The girlfriend had arranged it by talking to their mutual boss months in advance. The author is upset because they didn't consult him first, and they think asking their boss for time off without discussing it with them was unprofessional and could affect their career. The author refuses to go, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise vacation using their leave time, which was a big decision involving their job. The author feels it's unprofessional because their boss was involved without their knowledge. Also, the author didn't want to take an overseas trip, preferring to relax at home. The girlfriend didn't ask for permission, which is a big issue in relationships when making plans that affect the other person's schedule or career.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's intention might have been to do something nice, showing thoughtfulness by arranging something special. But on the other hand, making such a significant decision without discussing it with the partner could be seen as overstepping. The author's job is important, and using leave for a trip without their input could indeed be problematic, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. There's a risk of professional repercussions if the boss isn't careful with how they handle it. \n\nThe author's friends think they're ungrateful, but the issue here is more about consent and respect for boundaries. Gifts are nice, but when they involve major decisions that affect the other person's work and personal preferences, it's not just about gratitude but about mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't consider the author's preferences about travel versus relaxation. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the girlfriend's actions were appropriate. While the surprise might come from a good place, the lack of communication and the potential professional risk might tip the scales. The author has valid concerns about their career and personal preferences, so refusing to go because of these issues isn't necessarily inconsiderate\u2014it's about asserting their own needs. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. They have a right to their own preferences and to be consulted before such a significant decision is made. The girlfriend's mistake was not discussing it first, not the author's for declining the offer. So the answer should be B.\n"
