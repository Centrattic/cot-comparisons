Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and got the boss's approval months in advance without consulting the author. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep. He's worried about the professional implications of taking couples' leave and not wanting to travel overseas. Friends say he's ungrateful, but he stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with him, which is a significant issue. Even though she intended it as a surprise, it's a major life decision that affects him. His job-related concerns are valid, especially since they work under the same boss. Using company leave for travel without his input could risk his career, which is a legitimate reason to be upset. \n\nHowever, she did go to the effort and expense, so there's a conflict between her thoughtfulness and his personal preferences. But the main issue is whether he's wrong for not going. He didn't force her to book the trip; she did it without his consent. He's not obligated to accept something that makes him uncomfortable, especially professionally. His friends' reactions might be missing the point about communication rather than just being ungrateful.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the girlfriend's gesture was generous, and he should appreciate it despite his preferences. But the problem is the lack of communication, not the gift itself. He's within his rights to refuse something that could affect his job and personal plans. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing his ground here.\n"
