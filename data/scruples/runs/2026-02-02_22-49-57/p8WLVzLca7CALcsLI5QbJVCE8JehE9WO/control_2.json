Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland for his birthday. She got the flights and even talked to their mutual boss months ahead to arrange the leave. The author is upset because he didn't ask for this trip, didn't apply for leave himself, and feels it's unprofessional to use their boss for personal time off. He also mentions preferring to relax and sleep during his leave instead of traveling. He refused to go, which made her upset, and now his friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's actions. She made a big surprise without consulting him. She did talk to their boss, which the author sees as unprofessional because they work in different branches but report to the same boss. Using company resources or influence for personal time off might not be appropriate, especially if it's done without the employee's consent. The author's main issue is that she didn't ask him first. He values his alone time during leave and doesn't want to travel. \n\nThen, the girlfriend paid for everything, so returning the tickets would incur fees. The author is conflicted because he wants to respect her gesture but also his own preferences. His friends say he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not considering his perspective. The key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned, but she didn't check with him, which is a valid concern for the author. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to go? If someone plans a trip without asking, and the other person has different preferences, the person who made the plans might be at fault for not considering the other's wishes. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but because of personal comfort and professional reasons. So, maybe he's not wrong. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she put in effort. But since the author clearly communicated his reasons, it's a matter of differing priorities. \n\nThe author's friends think he's wrong, but maybe they're not seeing that the girlfriend overstepped by arranging leave without his approval. The author's stance is about respecting his own wishes, which is important. So overall, he might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
