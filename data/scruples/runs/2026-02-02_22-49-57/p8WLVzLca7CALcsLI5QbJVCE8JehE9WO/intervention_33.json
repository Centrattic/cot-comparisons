Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation without consulting the author, even though she arranged it with their boss. The author refuses to go because he didn't want to take overseas leave and feels it was unprofessional. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, arranged with their boss without the author's input. The author is in IT, she's in HR, both under the same big boss. He didn't know about it until the surprise, and now he's refusing to go because he thinks using work leave for overseas travel is unprofessional, especially since they're in the same company. Plus, he didn't get a say, and he would prefer relaxing at home.\n\nThe author's main arguments are that the girlfriend should have asked him first, that the arrangement with the boss was unprofessional, and that he doesn't want to travel overseas. The girlfriend is upset because he's not happy, and friends are saying he's ungrateful.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, the girlfriend paid for the trip, so he can't force her to cancel, but he can choose not to go. However, ethically, did she overstep by arranging leave without his input? Using company leave for personal use without discussing with him might be an issue. Also, coordinating with their boss without his knowledge could be seen as crossing a professional boundary, especially since they report to the same superior. That could risk both of their jobs if the boss finds out.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice. Maybe she thought it was a thoughtful surprise. But the method of obtaining the leave and not consulting him are key points. The author's concern about unprofessionalism is valid. If their boss knew, it could lead to problems, especially in a corporate setting where such actions might be frowned upon. Also, the author has a right to his own leave preferences. He might prefer to use his time off for rest rather than travel, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe friends saying he's ungrateful might not see the ethical issues involved. The girlfriend's actions could have caused a potential workplace issue, which the author is trying to avoid. Therefore, the author's refusal is based on professional concerns and personal preference, which are legitimate reasons. The girlfriend didn't have the right to use company leave for personal plans without discussing it with him, especially since he's the one who would be affected by the leave arrangement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his boundaries and professional integrity. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
