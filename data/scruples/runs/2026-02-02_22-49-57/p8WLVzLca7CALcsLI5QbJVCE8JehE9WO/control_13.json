Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend work in the same company but different departments. She arranged a surprise two-week trip to Switzerland, including flights and a ski resort. She got approval from their boss months in advance without asking him. The author is upset because he didn't want overseas travel and felt it's unprofessional to have his leave used like that without his input. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, possibly thinking it would be a romantic gesture. She went through the trouble of arranging everything, maybe even incurring cancellation fees. She might feel hurt or that her effort was wasted.\n\nOn the author's side, he didn't know about the trip until the surprise. He has a valid concern about the unprofessional aspect of the boss being involved without his knowledge. Also, he didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip. The key point here is that the girlfriend didn't consult him before making the plans. The author's main issue is that his autonomy over his time and career decisions was bypassed. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and respect each other's preferences. Even if the girlfriend's intention was good, not checking with him about such a significant commitment is a problem. The author has the right to decide how he uses his vacation time. The fact that his boss was involved without his knowledge adds another layer, as it could indeed affect his job. \n\nHis friends calling him ungrateful might be right in the sense that he didn't express gratitude for the gesture, but the core issue is about consent and shared decision-making. The author isn't wrong for wanting to use his leave as he prefers. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because he has the right to make decisions about his leave and his personal preferences should be respected. The girlfriend made a decision without his input, which is a relationship issue on her part."
