Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and arranged leave without consulting the author. He's upset because she didn't ask first, and he doesn't want to go overseas. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked. So the question is, is he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend used their leave time without consulting him. She went to their boss (they have the same boss) and arranged the leave secretly. He works in a company where using leave for a trip might be seen as unprofessional, especially if not properly managed. Also, he would prefer to use that time to relax and sleep at home. The girlfriend, on the other hand, spent money and time to plan this, expecting him to be happy. Now he's refusing to go, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, the main issue is lack of consultation. He feels she overstepped by making the decision without his input. His job and professional image are important, so getting leave without proper channels might be risky. He also explicitly states he doesn't want to go overseas, so the surprise was a bad idea. On the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, and he's rejecting it, which might be seen as ungrateful.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? The girlfriend did plan this without his consent. While her actions were well-meaning, she made a significant decision that affects both of them. In a relationship, major decisions like taking time off work should involve both parties. Especially when it impacts their professional life, which could have consequences. The fact that she went to their boss, which they both report to, adds another layer of risk if the company found out it was for a personal trip. That could affect both of their careers.\n\nThe author has valid reasons for being upset. He's not in the wrong for wanting to be consulted, especially for something as important as using his leave. The girlfriend's approach was probably too hasty and didn't consider his preferences. However, the author's response of refusing the trip might come off as dismissive of her effort. He could have tried to communicate his concerns and perhaps found a compromise, but he did mention that he would have suggested returning the tickets if he could. Since the tickets are already bought, he's stuck with it. His friends think he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not seeing the professional risks involved.\n\nIn relationships, surprises are okay, but they shouldn't override the other person's preferences or create unnecessary problems. The girlfriend should have checked with him before making the plans. The author isn't wrong for being upset and declining. The fact that he's in a position where his job and boss are involved makes it even more of a valid concern. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had a right to expect that his leave and his preferences would be considered, and she didn't seek his consent.\n"
