Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, using their leave time. She spoke to their boss months in advance without the author's knowledge. The key points here are that she made decisions without consulting him and used company resources (leave time) which could be unprofessional. The author feels it's not his decision to go on a trip, especially since he prefers to relax and sleep during his time off. He didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip without being asked.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they're seeking confirmation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend put in a lot of effort and money, expecting the author to be excited. She did coordinate with their boss, which might have been done to surprise him. But the author has valid concerns about professional boundaries and personal preferences. Using leave for a trip without the employee's consent could indeed be seen as unprofessional and might affect their career. Also, the author's right to choose how he spends his leave is important.\n\nThe friends think he's ungrateful, but that's a common reaction when someone expects gratitude for a surprise they didn't agree to. The girlfriend might feel hurt, but the author's stance is about his autonomy and professional concerns.\n\nSo, the main factors are:\n1. Professionalism: Using company leave without the employee's consent could be risky for the author's career.\n2. Autonomy: The author has the right to decide how to use his leave.\n3. Communication: The girlfriend didn't ask for his input, which is a key aspect of respecting his wishes.\n\nConsidering these points, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his preferences and professional boundaries. The girlfriend made unilateral decisions without his consent, which is a problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
