Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, which she arranged without his consent and by talking to their mutual boss in advance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip as a surprise, using their vacation leave, and she communicated with their boss without the partner's knowledge. The partner feels that this was unprofessional because they work in different departments but report to the same boss. He's also upset that she didn't ask him first, as he would have preferred to use his leave for something else like relaxing at home. He refused to go, leading to an argument, and friends are now saying he's being ungrateful.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Now, I have to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend wanted to do something nice, maybe a grand gesture to celebrate his birthday. She took the initiative, but perhaps without considering his preferences. On the other hand, the author has valid concerns about professional boundaries and personal choice. Using company leave for a trip without discussing it with the partner could be seen as overstepping, especially if it affects their job or if he's not comfortable with the arrangement.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a key factor. Even if she intended it as a surprise, important decisions like taking time off work and spending money on a trip should involve mutual agreement. The author is within his rights to express that he's not comfortable with the arrangement and to decline. His friends' reaction that he's ungrateful might stem from not seeing the lack of consultation as an issue.\n\nProfessionally, having a boss aware of personal vacation plans is standard, but since they both report to the same boss, there might be implications if the company has policies against discussing personal leave without employee input. The girlfriend's actions could potentially create a conflict of interest or unprofessional behavior if the boss was involved in keeping the trip a secret.\n\nThe author's preference to use his leave differently is also a personal choice. People have different relaxation needs, and the girlfriend assumed he wanted a ski trip, which he doesn't. The surprise aspect might have been well-intentioned, but the method of arranging it without consent is problematic.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for rejecting the trip. He has legitimate reasons related to professional conduct and personal preferences. The girlfriend's failure to communicate and seek approval is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
