Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the setup: the girlfriend works in HR, the author in IT, both same company but different branches. They only see each other before/after shifts. Important that they report to the same big boss. \n\nBirthday celebration with a fancy dinner and wine. Girlfriend gives a surprise envelope with flights to Switzerland. She mentions she talked to their boss months ago to get leave approved. The author is annoyed because she didn't ask him first, didn't know about applying for leave, and he prefers to relax at home. He refuses to go, she's upset, friends say he's being ungrateful. \n\nThe author's reasoning: he thinks it's unprofessional to have the boss arrange leave for a couples' trip without his input. Also, he didn't want an overseas trip. Friends say he should go, he's being ungrateful. \n\nNow, considering the AITA framework. The key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision (vacation, using leave, spending money) without consulting him. Even though she paid for it, the fact that she used their boss to arrange leave without his knowledge could be problematic. The author's right to refuse is his own preference, but is he in the wrong for not being grateful?\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. She may have thought she was doing something nice, but not discussing it first could be seen as overstepping. The author's concern about professional implications is valid\u2014using company leave for a personal trip without prior agreement might affect his job. Also, he has different preferences for relaxation. \n\nOn the other hand, she made a generous gesture. Refusing might seem ungrateful, but he's within his rights to set boundaries. The question is whether her actions were inappropriate by not seeking his input. \n\nIn many cases, people expect to be involved in decisions that affect their time and work. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for saying no. His friends might be right about being ungrateful, but the core issue is lack of communication from her side. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
