Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). Let's break it down.\n\nThe main issue here is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the author's birthday, including flights and a ski resort. She went to their mutual boss months in advance to arrange time off without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't agree to this and would prefer to use his leave time to relax and sleep. He refused to go, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend intended a nice surprise, maybe thinking the trip would be a great experience. She took the initiative because she knew he didn't apply for leave yet. However, the author feels that using company leave for an overseas trip without his input is unprofessional and not something he's comfortable with. He also values his personal time for relaxation, not travel.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, did she overstep? She made a big decision that affects him without discussing it. Even if her intentions were good, not checking with him first could be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy. He has a right to decide how he uses his leave, and she shouldn't have unilaterally made that choice. Plus, involving their boss in this could indeed be risky for their careers if the company has policies against such requests.\n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean he has to comply with something he's uncomfortable with. The key points are respect for personal boundaries and communication. The girlfriend didn't respect his potential discomfort with the trip and didn't communicate her plans. The author is justified in wanting to use his leave as he prefers.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
