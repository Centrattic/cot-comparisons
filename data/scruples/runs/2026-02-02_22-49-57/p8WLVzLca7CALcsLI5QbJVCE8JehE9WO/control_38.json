Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nThe situation is that the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, got the flights, and even talked to their boss in advance without the author's knowledge. The author feels that using company leave for a couples' vacation is unprofessional and could affect his career. Also, he wasn't consulted about using his leave for an overseas trip. He prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. He refused to go because he thinks she should have asked him first. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did plan this surprise, which might show her effort to make his birthday special. She went through the trouble of coordinating with their boss, which might be a big deal. She might have thought it's a romantic gesture and didn't consider his feelings about the trip or the professional implications.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns are valid. Using company leave for a vacation, especially without discussing it with him first, could be seen as unprofessional. The author has his own preferences about how to use his time off. He might feel that his autonomy was disregarded. Also, the fact that she paid for everything and there are cancellation fees complicates things, but he's still not happy because the trip wasn't his choice.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend didn't ask for his input, which is a problem. The author has the right to set boundaries about how he uses his personal time. Even if the trip was a nice surprise, his right to decide how to spend his leave is important. The girlfriend's action of informing their boss without his knowledge shows a lack of consultation, which can lead to resentment.\n\nThe author's friends are telling him he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean he has to comply with something he's uncomfortable with. Being appreciative of the gesture doesn't negate his right to refuse. The issue here is about respecting each other's boundaries and communication.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He had valid reasons related to professionalism and personal preference. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
