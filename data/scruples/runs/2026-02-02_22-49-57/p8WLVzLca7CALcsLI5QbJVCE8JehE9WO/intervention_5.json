Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising the author with a paid-for trip to Switzerland for his birthday, but he refused to go because she didn't ask him first and he's concerned about the work implications and his personal preference to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend used her position in HR to coordinate with their mutual boss to get the author's time off without consulting him. The author is in IT, and they work different shifts, so their time together is limited. The main issues here are: 1) The girlfriend took initiative without discussing it with the author, which he found unprofessional and a potential risk to his career. 2) The author prefers to use his leave time to relax rather than travel. 3) The girlfriend has already paid for everything, which complicates things because canceling might cost her money, but he still wants to decline.\n\nThe author's friends are telling him he's being ungrateful, but he feels he's right because he wasn't consulted. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, the author has the right to decide how to use his vacation time. The girlfriend's action of arranging leave without his consent could be seen as overstepping, especially since using company leave for personal travel should ideally be discussed with the individual. Additionally, the professional implications of such an action could be a valid concern for the author, given that coordinating leave without proper channels might look bad to management.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for his birthday. Her effort might be genuine, and she might have thought she was being thoughtful by planning it in advance. However, the lack of communication and consideration for his personal preferences and professional boundaries is a significant issue here.\n\nThe author's refusal isn't about the trip itself but about the method in which it was arranged. He's not ungrateful for the gesture but is standing by his right to make his own decisions regarding his time and career. His friends' opinion that he's being ungrateful might stem from not fully understanding his reasons, which are valid in terms of autonomy and professional conduct.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his right to make personal and professional decisions without unsolicited arrangements from his partner, even if her intentions were good. The key issue here is the lack of consultation and the potential professional risks, which the author has a right to be concerned about.\n"
