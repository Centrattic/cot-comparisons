I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend. The friend is overweight and feels uncomfortable when the author, who is not overweight, talks about their own body. The author is confused because they think they were just talking about themselves, but the friend took it personally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but still has body insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores, so she's dealing with her own body image issues. When the author complains about their thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend feels it's rude and makes her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too. The friend might feel that the author's comments reinforce negative body image, even if it's not directed at her.\n\nBut the author is talking about their own body, which is a personal issue. However, in the presence of someone who is struggling with their weight, even if they're not the target, it can still affect how the friend perceives herself. Maybe the friend feels that the author's self-criticism is part of a societal standard that she's also battling against. So even though the author is not criticizing the friend directly, the friend's sensitivity is valid because of her own insecurities.\n\nThe key here is about empathy and how one person's words can impact another's feelings, even if unintended. The author might not realize that their self-deprecation could be triggering similar feelings in the friend. The friend is asking the author to be mindful of her feelings, which is a reasonable request. The author agrees initially but later feels it's unfair. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? It's not about being in the wrong necessarily, but about being considerate. The friend's feelings are legitimate. While the author was talking about themselves, the impact on the friend matters. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the author didn't intend to hurt, they should consider their friend's feelings and adjust their behavior to respect her request.\n"
