I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend felt upset because the author's comments made her self-conscious, even though the author was talking about their own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and feels the author's comments about their own body make her uncomfortable because it's a sensitive topic for her. The author is confused because they were just talking about themselves, but the friend feels it's rude.\n\nI remember that sometimes when people are in a sensitive group, others' negative comments about their own bodies can trigger feelings in them. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend might feel compared or judged indirectly. The author's self-criticism could make the friend feel like they're also being criticized, especially if they have their own body image issues.\n\nThe author says they don't think the friend is unattractive and even compliment her, but the friend might not feel that way. The key here is about how the friend perceives the situation. Even if the author's intent is purely self-deprecating, the impact on the friend matters. The friend's request to not talk about weight in front of her is a boundary, and respecting that could be important for their friendship.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to hurt the friend, the act of talking about their own body in a way that triggers the friend's insecurities could be considered rude. The author's argument is that it's about themselves, but the friend's reaction shows that it's affecting her. In that case, maybe the author should respect the friend's feelings and avoid that topic.\n\nBut then again, the author has their own insecurities and might feel they should be able to express themself. However, if it's causing someone else distress, it's a matter of balancing their needs with the friend's. The friend's request is valid, so the author might need to adjust to maintain the friendship. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words affect the friend, even if unintentionally.\n"
