I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments made her feel self-conscious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own insecurities, not the friend's body. They mentioned that they're not overweight and they even compliment the friend. But the friend feels that hearing the author talk about needing to lose weight makes her think about her own body negatively. \n\nThe key point here is about how one person's self-talk affects another. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, their words might still trigger the friend's own insecurities. The friend made it clear that this upsets her, so the author's comments have a negative impact. \n\nThe author initially agreed to stop making those comments but now feels it was unfair. However, the friend's feelings are valid. It's possible that the author isn't being intentionally rude, but the effect is there. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn situations where someone's actions hurt another person's feelings, even if unintentionally, they can be considered in the wrong if they don't respect the other's feelings. The author should consider their friend's perspective and adjust their behavior to be more considerate. So the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
