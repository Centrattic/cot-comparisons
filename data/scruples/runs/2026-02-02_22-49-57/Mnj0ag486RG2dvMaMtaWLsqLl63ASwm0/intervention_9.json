I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which might not be accurate based on weight alone, but they have insecurities. They have a friend who is overweight (shopping at plus size stores) and the friend gets upset when the author talks about their own body. The author says they don't think the friend is unattractive, but when they complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend felt it was rude and made her uncomfortable. The friend mentioned she needs to lose 70+ pounds, so hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nThe author agreed to the friend's request not to talk about wanting to lose weight in front of her, but now they feel it was unfair. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The author is talking about their own body, which is a personal issue. But the friend's reaction is based on how the author's comments make her feel. The author's comments might trigger the friend's own insecurities. Even though the author is not directly targeting the friend, the friend is taking it personally. \n\nIn social situations, even when talking about oneself, people can be sensitive to how their comments affect others. If the friend is already struggling with body image issues, hearing someone else in a smaller size talk about their own body negatively might make her feel worse. The author might not intend to hurt the friend, but the friend's feelings are valid here. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's self-criticism is inherently rude. The friend didn't object to the author's self-talk in general, but specifically when it's about needing to lose weight. The author's justification is that it's about themselves, but the impact on the friend is real. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention is self-criticism, the friend's discomfort is a legitimate reason for the author to adjust their behavior. The author isn't being malicious, but in this context, the friend is sensitive. It's possible that the author could have chosen a different way to express their insecurities without making the friend feel uncomfortable. \n\nTherefore, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a malicious sense, they might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words affect their friend. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have been more mindful of their friend's feelings.\n"
