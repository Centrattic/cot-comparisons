I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their friend, who is overweight, gets upset when the author calls themselves fat. The author is 125 lbs, so they're not overweight, but they do have insecurities. The friend shops in plus-size stores, so she's definitely in a different size category.\n\nThe author was trying on yoga pants and mentioned their thighs looked big, needing to lose weight and go to the gym. The friend then told them it's rude to talk about their body in front of her because she needs to lose 70+ pounds and it makes her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author said they think their friend looks great and that it's about themselves. The friend asked them to stop, and the author agreed but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is talking about their own body, not the friend's. But the friend is sensitive because of her own weight issues. The author feels it's not their responsibility to censor themselves, especially since their own weight isn't an issue. But the friend is upset. \n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. In general, people can talk about their own bodies, right? Unless it's directly targeting someone. But the friend might have a hard time with body image, so even if it's about herself, the author's comments could trigger the friend's insecurities. \n\nThe author says they have insecurities too, but they're not overweight. Maybe the friend is overprojecting, but it's also possible that the author's self-criticism made the friend feel judged. The author's self-talk might be seen as perpetuating negative body image, which can be contagious. So even if the author is talking about themselves, it's possible that their friend is taking it as a reflection on her, especially if she's struggling with her own weight. \n\nThe author agreed to stop, but now feels it was unfair. The question is whether the author was actually in the wrong. The friend's request is about her own comfort. It's a bit of a sensitive situation. While the author was discussing their own body, the impact on the friend is significant. If the author's behavior makes the friend uncomfortable, even if it's not intentional, it might be considerate to respect her request. \n\nBut the author argues that it's about their own insecurities. There's a line between self-talk and making someone else feel judged. If the friend is sensitive to weight-related comments, then the author might not be in the wrong, but maybe they should have been more mindful. However, the friend did express discomfort, so perhaps the author should respect that even if they don't see it as their fault. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they were talking about themselves, but the answer might depend on the friend's feelings. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions were about their own body and not directly about the friend, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But sometimes in relationships, how you speak about yourself can affect others. If the friend is overprojecting, the author might not be at fault, but it's still about respecting others' feelings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because even if it's self-directed, it can still hurt the friend. The friend's request is about her comfort, and the author's self-criticism might be triggering her. So the author should adjust their behavior to respect the friend's boundaries, even if they feel it's about themselves. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on the context of their friendship and how the friend perceives the comments. Since the author is not overweight, their self-criticism might be about different insecurities (like thigh size even if they're not heavy), which the friend might not be able to handle because of her own issues. The author isn't wrong for having insecurities, but if their comments make the friend uncomfortable, then they might need to consider that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The friend's request is valid based on her feelings. The author might not be wrong in talking about their own body, but they should respect the friend's boundaries. So maybe the answer is A, because even if unintentional, the author's behavior caused discomfort and the friend asked them to stop. The author agreed initially, so maybe they should follow through. \n\nBut the author is confused because they think it's their own body. It's a common issue where people's self-talk can affect others. So while the author isn't directly at fault, they might be in the wrong in this specific situation because the friend is clearly hurt and made a request. Therefore, the answer is A. Wait, but the options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no. So if the author is in the wrong, answer A. If not, B. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important here. The author's self-criticism might not be wrong, but if it's causing harm to the friend, the author should adjust. It's a matter of considering the other person's feelings. So maybe the answer is A, because the author's behavior, even if self-directed, is affecting the friend negatively, and they should be considerate. Alternatively, the answer might be B if the friend is overreacting. \n\nBut given that the friend expressed discomfort and the author initially agreed to stop, the appropriate response is to respect that request. Even if the author feels it's unfair, the impact is real. So the author isn't in the wrong for having insecurities, but perhaps in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings once they were expressed. So the answer would be A. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the friend is sensitive and the author's self-criticism makes her uncomfortable, then the author isn't wrong per se, but maybe they should have been more mindful. However, the friend's request is a boundary. The author agreed, so if they don't follow through, that's a problem. But the main question is whether the author was in the wrong initially. \n\nI think the key point is that the author was discussing their own body, which is their right. However, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect them. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the author should still comply with the request for the sake of the friendship. \n\nAlternatively, if the author's self-talk indirectly makes the friend feel judged, even if it's not intended, the author might be in the wrong. Because sometimes, even if you're talking about yourself, it can affect others negatively. So in this case, the author might need to be more considerate. Therefore, answer A. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The author isn't wrong in having insecurities or talking about their own body, but the friend's feelings are important. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the author should still stop to respect the friend's boundaries. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they should stop. The friend is asking them to stop because her feelings are hurt. So the author's actions caused harm, even if unintended. Therefore, the answer is A. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: It's not the author's fault for having insecurities, but they could be more considerate. The friend's request is about her own feelings. The author isn't in the wrong, but the friend's sensitivity is a factor. So the answer would be B. \n\nWait, the friend says that the author's comments make her wonder what the author thinks of her. That's a projection. The author's self-talk is about themselves, but the friend is associating it with her. So the author isn't wrong for talking about their own body, but the friend is being sensitive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong (B), but should respect the friend's request to avoid making her uncomfortable. \n\nSo the correct answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but should still comply with the friend's request. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions were about themselves, and the friend's reaction is due to her own issues, the answer is B. However, the author might be advised to be more considerate in the future.\n"
