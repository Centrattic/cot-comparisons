I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their friend. The situation is that the author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which upsets their overweight friend. The friend feels it's rude and makes her uncomfortable because she needs to lose weight too.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how talking about one's own body image can affect others. The author argues that it's about themselves, but the friend is upset because she compares herself to the author. The author is not overweight, but the friend is. The author's comments might inadvertently make the friend feel worse about her own body. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, if someone's self-deprecating comments make others uncomfortable, even if the comments are about themselves, the person might need to consider the impact on others. The friend is asking them to stop, which implies that the author's words are affecting her negatively. \n\nBut the author might feel it's their right to express their own insecurities. However, in social interactions, it's often expected to be mindful of others' feelings. The author's friend has a valid reason to feel hurt because even though the author is not criticizing her directly, the context of body image can lead to comparisons. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their self-critical comments are causing distress to their friend, and they should respect the friend's feelings by not making such comments in her presence.\n"
