I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend who is overweight and gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and isn't overweight, but she has insecurities. When she talks about her body, her friend feels uncomfortable because she needs to lose weight. The friend asked the author not to talk about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author agreed at first but now thinks it was unfair.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about body image and how comments about one's own body can affect others. The author is talking about her own insecurities, but her friend interprets it as a negative comparison. The question is whether the author was rude in speaking about her own body in front of her friend.\n\nI need to consider if it's wrong for the author to talk about her own body image issues when her friend is sensitive to it. Even though the author is talking about herself, her friend might feel that it's a judgment on her own body. The friend's feelings are valid, so maybe the author should be more mindful. But is the author actually in the wrong?\n\nOn one hand, people have different sensitivities, and if the author's comments are making her friend uncomfortable, then maybe she should adjust her behavior for the friendship. On the other hand, the author is expressing her own insecurities, which are her own issues. However, since it's affecting her friend's feelings, the author might be unintentionally causing harm. \n\nThe friend's request is about her own emotional well-being. The author might not have intended to hurt her friend, but the impact is there. In such cases, even if the intention is good, the action can still be problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong because she's causing distress to her friend, even if it's about herself. \n\nBut wait, is it possible that the author isn't in the wrong because she's just talking about herself? The answer depends on whether the friend's reaction is reasonable. The friend might feel that the author's negative self-talk inadvertently makes her feel worse about herself. In that case, it's about empathy and respecting others' feelings. So, even if the author didn't mean to, she's causing harm, which means she should consider her friend's perspective. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being considerate enough of her friend's feelings.\n"
