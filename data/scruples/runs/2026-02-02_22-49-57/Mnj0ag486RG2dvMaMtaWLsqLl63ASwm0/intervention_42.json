I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's overweight friend getting upset when the author talks about her own body. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but she has insecurities. She tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs looking large, leading her friend to feel uncomfortable. The friend said it's rude because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author argues it's about herself, but the friend asked her not to talk about needing to lose weight in front of her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether talking about her own insecurities in front of a friend who is struggling with her weight is considered rude. The author feels she's not in the wrong, but the friend is upset. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, body image issues are sensitive. Even if the author is talking about her own body, a friend with their own struggles might internalize that. The friend might feel that the author is indirectly criticizing her or that the author's insecurities make her feel worse about herself. The author's intention was to talk about herself, but the impact on her friend is significant. \n\nThe friend's request is about her own emotional well-being. While the author might not have intended to hurt her, the act of discussing weight in front of someone who is sensitive to it can be hurtful. The key here is that the friend's feelings are valid. Even if the author is not the target of the comment, the context and the friend's sensitivity matter. \n\nIn terms of social interactions, it's about being mindful of others' feelings. The author might have overstepped by not considering how her friend might react. The friend's reaction suggests that this was a boundary she needed to respect. The author's initial agreement to stop the behavior but then questioning it shows some conflict. \n\nSo, even though the author is not in the wrong in the sense of having a right to talk about her own insecurities, the context and the friend's feelings make it a matter of respect. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because her actions, while unintentional, caused harm, and respecting her friend's request is the right course of action.\n"
