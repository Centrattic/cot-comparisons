I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who's upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and acknowledges she's not overweight, but she has body insecurities. Her friend is overweight and needs plus-size clothes. When they were shopping, the author complained about her thighs looking big and needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset, explaining that she needs to lose 70+ pounds, and the author's comments made her feel bad. The author then agreed not to talk about her weight in front of her friend but now feels it was unfair.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about body image and how one person's comments can affect another. The author is self-critical, but her friend interprets it as a reflection on her own body. Even if the author meant it as self-deprecating, the friend is vulnerable in that area. People often compare themselves to others, so when the author talks about her body in a negative way, the friend might feel worse about her own body. The author might not realize how sensitive the topic is for her friend.\n\nBut the author argues she was talking about herself, not the friend. But maybe the friend is in a place where she's already struggling with her weight, and hearing someone else talk about their weight, even if it's the opposite, triggers her own insecurities. The author might have a right to discuss her own body, but if it's causing someone else emotional distress, it's worth considering the impact. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people don't realize how their words affect others. The author might not be intentionally rude, but the effect is negative. The friend's request is to stop talking about weight in front of her. The author might feel it's unfair, but maybe she needs to respect her friend's feelings. So, technically, the author could be in the wrong for not considering her friend's perspective and continuing to make her uncomfortable. \n\nThe answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because her comments about her own body negatively affect her friend's emotional state, even if unintentionally. It's about being considerate of others' sensitivities, even if the comments are self-directed.\n"
