I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, who got upset because she's trying to lose weight and finds it uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have body insecurities. Their friend is in a plus-size category and needs to lose 70 pounds. The author mentions their own body issues, like large thighs, and wants to lose weight. The friend feels hurt because she's comparing herself to the author's comments.\n\nSo, the main question is about self-criticism affecting someone else. The author might not have intended to make the friend feel worse, but their self-talk could inadvertently trigger the friend's insecurities. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend's reaction is valid because she's dealing with her own body image issues. \n\nThe author says they agreed to stop talking about it, but now feel it's unfair. But the key here is empathy. The friend's feelings are important. The author's self-criticism might not be meant to harm, but it's causing harm. So even if the author isn't targeting the friend, their words still have an impact. \n\nThe correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because their self-deprecating comments are affecting their friend's emotional well-being, even if unintentionally. They should be more mindful of how their words might influence others, especially someone who's struggling with similar issues.\n"
