I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, which made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is not overweight (125 lbs) but has body insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, saying they need to lose weight. The friend, who is in a plus-size category, felt uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too. She told the author it's rude to talk about their body in front of her, making her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are about how talking about one's own body image issues can affect others. The author's friend is struggling with her own weight and body image, and hearing the author's complaints might trigger her insecurities. Even though the author was talking about themselves, the friend perceives it as a comparison or a reflection on her own body.\n\nI remember that in social dynamics, even self-deprecating comments can unintentionally hurt others, especially when they have similar or related insecurities. The friend might feel that the author is being more confident or that the author's comments make her feel worse about herself. The author's intention was to talk about themselves, but the impact on the friend is negative.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend clearly expressed that the behavior is making her uncomfortable, then the author should respect that boundary. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt the friend, once the friend has communicated the issue, continuing the behavior could be considered rude.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that it's their own body and they should be able to talk about their insecurities without restriction. But in this case, the friend is setting a boundary, and respecting that is important for maintaining the friendship. So, even if the author didn't mean any harm, they should stop making those comments if it's causing the friend distress.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they should respect the friend's feelings and adjust their behavior despite their own intentions. However, there's a nuance here because the author is dealing with their own insecurities. But since the friend is directly affected, the author needs to consider the impact and respect the friend's request.\n"
