I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a person who is not overweight (125 lbs) and has a friend who is overweight. The friend shops in plus-size stores, so she's definitely bigger. The author has body insecurities. When they were shopping, the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking big, saying they need to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset, said it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her because the author's comments make the friend feel self-conscious, especially since she herself needs to lose a lot of weight. The author told the friend she looks great and that it's not about her, but the friend still asked them to stop. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair. They're asking if they were in the wrong by talking negatively about their own body.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I have to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body negatively, which might trigger the friend's insecurities. Even though the author's intention is to talk about themselves, the friend is affected. The question is whether the author's actions were rude, even if they were talking about themselves.\n\nBody image issues are sensitive. People, especially those with their own insecurities, can react strongly to others' comments about weight. The author's friend might feel that hearing someone else talk about their body in a negative way, even if they're not the target, can make them feel worse about themselves. That's a common reaction. The friend's response is valid because she's experiencing discomfort.\n\nHowever, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities. It's natural for people to express these feelings, but the context matters. The author is doing this in front of someone who is already in a vulnerable position regarding their body image. The friend's request to stop is about her own feelings and boundaries. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is real.\n\nThe key here is about considering others' feelings even when the topic is personal. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they are causing discomfort. The friend's reaction is about her own emotional state, not the author's right to talk about their body. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words affect the friend, even if they were talking about themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they have the right to discuss their own body without being censored, especially if they didn't mean to hurt. But in this case, the friend felt hurt and asked them to stop. The question is whether the author should have anticipated that their comments might upset the friend.\n\nI think the author's intention wasn't to be rude, but the impact matters. The friend's sensitivity is valid. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account the friend's feelings, even if they thought it was about themselves. The answer would be A.\n"
