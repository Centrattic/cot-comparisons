I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their friend got upset when they called themselves fat. So, the author is thin (125 lbs) but has body insecurities. They were trying on yoga pants and mentioned their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is overweight, felt uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too, and hearing the author talk about their own body made her question how the author sees her.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was to talk about their own insecurities, not the friend. But maybe the friend is sensitive because she's dealing with similar issues. The author might not realize that their self-deprecating comments can trigger others. Even if it's about their own body, it's possible that the friend interpreted it as a reflection on her own weight. \n\nThe friend did ask the author to stop talking about needing to lose weight around her. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair. But the friend's request is valid because she's uncomfortable. The author's actions, while focusing on their own body, may have been hurtful to the friend. So even if the author meant no harm, the impact matters here. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author is responsible for the friend's discomfort. The author might not have considered the friend's feelings, so maybe they should be more mindful. But the question is if they are in the wrong. Since the friend is the one who is sensitive, the author's self-criticism could be seen as indirect body-shaming. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I should weigh the social dynamics. People can have different sensitivities, and even if the author is talking about themselves, it's possible that the friend feels judged. So the answer might be A (Yes) because the author's comments, though about themselves, caused harm and the friend's request is reasonable. But I'm a bit torn because the author didn't mean to target the friend. However, the friend's feelings are important, so the author should respect that.\n"
