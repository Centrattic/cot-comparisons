I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the friend got upset because the author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, which made the friend uncomfortable since she also needs to lose weight but feels judged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, while the friend is in plus-size stores. The author's friend is sensitive about weight discussions because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds. The author mentions they think their friend looks great, so it's not about criticizing her. But when the author talks about their own insecurities, the friend feels compared or judged.\n\nThe key point is whether talking about one's own body negatively affects someone else. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, their self-criticism might trigger the friend's own insecurities. The friend is setting a boundary here, asking not to hear the author's self-criticism. Boundaries are important in relationships. Even if the author feels it's unfair, the friend's comfort and mental health matter.\n\nThe author says they know they shouldn't talk like that, implying they're aware it's not healthy, but the friend's request makes them feel it's unfair. However, respecting others' boundaries is generally the right thing to do, even if it doesn't feel fair. The author's self-talk might contribute to a negative body image environment, which the friend is reacting against.\n\nSo, while the author is not intentionally being rude, their actions still caused distress. The friend's request is valid because people have different sensitivities. The author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings, even if it's about themselves. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's perspective and breached her boundaries.\n"
