I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who is upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has body insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and asked the author to stop talking about her body in front of her because it makes her uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the core issue is about how self-deprecating comments can affect others, especially those with different body experiences. The author is talking about her own body, but the friend interprets it as a reflection on her own body. The author is trying to be honest about her insecurities, but the friend feels it's triggering or rude. \n\nFirst, even if the author is talking about herself, her words can still impact others. The friend is in a situation where her self-esteem might be more sensitive to body-related comments. The fact that the friend asked the author to stop suggests that the author's comments are causing emotional discomfort. \n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt her friend, but intentions don't always override the impact. The friend's request is about her own feelings, so the author might need to respect that boundary. The author's response that it's about herself doesn't change the fact that the friend is connecting the two. \n\nAlso, the author mentions she knows she shouldn't talk about her weight like that anyway. So even if it's not inherently wrong, it's something she's aware is not ideal. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author has a choice to either adjust her behavior (even if it's about herself) to respect the friend's boundaries or risk the friendship. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author's actions were rude or hurtful. Since the friend was clearly upset and made a specific request, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting that boundary, even if the comments were about herself. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
