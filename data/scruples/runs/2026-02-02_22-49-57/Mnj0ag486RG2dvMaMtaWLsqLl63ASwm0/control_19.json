I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, even though the author is not overweight. The friend feels it's rude and makes her uncomfortable since she needs to lose weight too.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image and how self-criticism can affect others. The author is trying to be honest about their own insecurities, but the friend is taking it personally. The author is 125 lbs, which is not overweight, but they're still commenting on their body in a negative way. The friend is in a different situation, being in plus size stores, but she's also struggling with her own weight. \n\nI think the main issue is that even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend is interpreting it as a reflection on her. The author might not realize how their self-critical comments can make others with body image issues feel worse. Even if the author's intention is to vent about their own insecurities, the friend's feelings are valid. It's possible that the author's self-deprecating remarks could trigger the friend's own insecurities or make her feel judged. \n\nThe author did agree to stop talking about it, but now they're questioning if that was unfair. But the friend's request is about her comfort and emotional well-being. So maybe the author is in the wrong because even though they're talking about themselves, their actions are affecting the friend's feelings. The author should consider how their words impact others, especially friends who might have similar or different body image issues. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because their self-criticism is causing discomfort to their friend, even if unintentionally. They should respect the friend's feelings and adjust their behavior to be more mindful.\n"
