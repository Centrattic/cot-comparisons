I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the friend got upset because when the author talks about their own weight (even though they're not overweight), the friend feels it's making her uncomfortable. The author tried to explain it's about themselves, but the friend is still hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs, which they acknowledge isn't overweight. However, they have insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and is trying to lose weight. When the author talks about their thighs and needing to lose weight, it's causing the friend to feel self-conscious. \n\nThe key point here is that even if the author isn't being negative about the friend directly, their comments about their own body might trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend's feelings are valid, right? People often compare themselves to others, especially in sensitive areas like body image. If the author is talking about their own weight in a way that implies a certain body size is better, it could make the friend feel worse about herself, even if that's not the author's intention.\n\nThen there's the fact that the friend explicitly asked the author to stop. The author agreed initially but later felt it was unfair. But when someone asks you not to do something that's making them uncomfortable, respecting their boundaries is important in a friendship. Even if the author thinks it's about themselves, the impact on the friend is real.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? If talking about their own body in that context is causing harm, even unintentionally, then yes, they might be in the wrong because they're not considering their friend's feelings. The author could have chosen to be more mindful of their words, especially in a situation where body image is a sensitive topic for the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't criticizing the friend directly. They're expressing their own insecurities. But maybe the problem is that the author isn't aware of how their self-criticism might inadvertently affect someone else who's already struggling with their own body image. It's about empathy and how our words can have unintended consequences. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their comments, though about themselves, are causing distress to their friend, and they should have been more considerate of the friend's feelings and boundaries.\n"
