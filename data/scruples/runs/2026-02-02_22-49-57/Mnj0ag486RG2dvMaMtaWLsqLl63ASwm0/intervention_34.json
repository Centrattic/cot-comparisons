I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat or talks about needing to lose weight in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight too, and hearing the author talk about their own body makes her feel uncomfortable, as if the author is judging her.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were just talking about themselves, not the friend. They acknowledge they shouldn't talk that way in general but are unsure if they specifically wronged their friend. The friend's perspective is that it's emotionally hurtful for her to hear someone else talk negatively about their body when she's already struggling with her own weight issues.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about how personal body talk can affect others. Even if the author is talking about their own insecurities, the friend is taking it as a reflection on herself. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact is there. In relationships, intent vs. impact is a common issue. Even if the intention was self-criticism, the friend feels judged. \n\nThe author says they agreed to stop talking that way in front of the friend but now think it's unfair. The question is whether that request was fair. The friend is asking for consideration, which is a reasonable request in a friendship. If someone's behavior is making you uncomfortable, it's okay to ask them to adjust it. \n\nThe author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a strict sense, but they did do something that hurt their friend's feelings. The friend's request is a valid one because personal insecurities can be sensitive. The author could have been more aware of how their self-talk affects others, especially someone who is dealing with similar issues. So even if the author didn't mean to, they should consider their friend's feelings and respect the request. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong, because even though they were talking about themselves, it's respectful to consider how others might feel. Alternatively, B (No), if the intention was purely self-criticism and the friend's reaction is over-sensitive. But given the context, the friend's request is about her own emotional well-being, so the author should comply. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's boundaries.\n"
