I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend who is also overweight.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're 125 lbs and realize they're not overweight, but have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she needs to lose 70+ pounds and felt self-conscious when the author talked about their own weight. The author now feels the friend's request was unfair.\n\nHmm. The key here is about self-talk in front of someone who is struggling with weight. Even if the author is talking about themselves, it might trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend made it clear that this makes her uncomfortable, so the author agreed initially but later feels it's unfair.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is talking about their own body, which is their right. On the other, if it's causing a friend distress, maybe they should consider their friend's feelings. The author says they think their friend looks great, but the friend might feel the author is setting a standard. \n\nBut the author isn't directly criticizing the friend; it's their own self-talk. However, sometimes when people discuss their own weight loss, it can imply a negative view of their body, which might be hard for others to hear. The friend's sensitivity is valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for having insecurities and expressing them. The author could adjust to be more mindful, but the initial action isn't necessarily wrong. So I'd lean towards B.\n"
