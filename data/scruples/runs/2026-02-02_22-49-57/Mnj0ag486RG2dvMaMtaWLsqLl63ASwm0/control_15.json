I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 125 lbs and has an overweight friend. They were shopping, and the author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs looking big, and mentioned needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset and said it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her because the friend is trying to lose weight too and it makes her uncomfortable. The author initially agreed not to do it anymore but now feels it was an unfair request. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by speaking negatively about their own body in front of their friend.\n\nHmm, body image issues are tricky. The author is talking about their own insecurities, which they acknowledge. The friend is sensitive about her own weight and feels triggered by the author's comments. Even though the author's intention was to express personal feelings and not to belittle the friend, the friend still felt uncomfortable. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's friend is in a vulnerable place regarding her body image. The author's own negative self-talk might unintentionally reinforce the friend's insecurities. For example, if the friend is trying to lose weight, hearing the author talk about their own weight loss needs could make her feel judged or that the author is comparing them. It's about how the friend feels, not just the author's intent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they think their friend looks great, but the friend's reaction shows that the comments are still affecting her. Maybe the author should consider that even self-deprecating remarks can have a negative impact on others, especially when they share similar insecurities. The author's friend asked them to stop, so respecting that boundary is important in a friendship. So even if it wasn't malicious, it's still rude in this context because it's causing harm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
