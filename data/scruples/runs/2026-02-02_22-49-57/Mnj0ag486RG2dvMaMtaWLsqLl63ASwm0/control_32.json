I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is overweight and shops in plus-size stores. When the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend got upset. The friend explained that hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and wonders if the author is judging her. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. People can have different reactions to others talking about their bodies. The author is criticizing their own body, but the friend might interpret that as a standard or a comparison. The friend is sensitive about her own weight, so hearing someone else's body concerns, even if it's self-criticism, might trigger her insecurities. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact is there. The key here is that the author's comments about their own body, despite being self-deprecating, could still affect others, especially someone who is struggling with similar issues.\n\nIn general, when someone is trying to improve their health or body image, hearing others talk about their own weight might make them feel worse. It's about being considerate of others' feelings, even if the comments are about oneself. The author might not see their words as a problem, but the friend clearly does. So, the author's actions, while not malicious, could be considered inconsiderate. The correct choice here is likely A, the author is in the wrong. But wait, some might argue that the friend is taking it too personally. However, the main point is that the friend felt uncomfortable. Since the author's behavior caused harm, even if unintentionally, the author should respect the friend's request. So, the answer is A.\n"
