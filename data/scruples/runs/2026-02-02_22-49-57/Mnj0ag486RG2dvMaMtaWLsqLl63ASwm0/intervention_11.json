I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has body insecurities. She and her friend were shopping, and when the author tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs and needing to lose weight, her friend got upset. The friend thinks it's rude for the author to talk about her own body in front of her because she's trying to lose weight and it makes her uncomfortable. The author agreed not to talk about it anymore but now feels it was unfair.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is talking about her own body in front of her friend. But the friend is in a different situation\u2014overweight and trying to lose weight. The author is saying she's not trying to comment on her friend, but the friend feels it's triggering. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often avoid discussing weight loss in front of others who might be in a vulnerable position. Even if the author is talking about herself, the friend might perceive it as a comparison. The author isn't being negative about her friend, but the act of discussing her own weight might make the friend feel worse. \n\nBut the author isn't directly criticizing her friend. The friend's reaction is more about her own insecurities. So is the author at fault here? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is expressing her own insecurities, which is valid. On the other hand, the friend is affected by that conversation. \n\nI think the key here is about empathy and sensitivity. Even if the author's intention is to talk about herself, the friend's feelings are real. The author might not have considered how her words affect her friend. The friend asked her not to talk about it, which is a boundary. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her own feelings, but she should be aware of her friend's sensitivities. However, the friend's request to stop talking about it is reasonable because it's affecting her. So the author might be in the wrong if she continues to talk about it despite the friend's feelings. But the initial act of expressing her own insecurities isn't inherently rude. \n\nWait, but the friend is specifically upset because the author is in a different body situation. If the author is not overweight, her complaints might not be relatable to her friend, and could make her feel worse. So maybe the author's comments are inadvertently making her friend feel judged. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author isn't in the wrong, but she should respect her friend's boundaries. However, since the friend asked her not to do it, the author should follow through. But the question is whether she was in the wrong in the first place. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe it's a B. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her own issues, but she's responsible for respecting her friend's feelings. However, the act of talking about her own body isn't inherently rude. The friend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't at fault for her own insecurities. So the answer might be B. No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
