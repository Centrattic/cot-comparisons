I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for discussing their body image in front of their overweight friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 125 lbs and has insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and is trying to lose 70+ pounds. The friend gets upset when the author talks about their own weight, which makes the friend compare herself and feel uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether talking about one's own body in the presence of someone with different body image issues is considered rude or not. The author argues it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend feels it's triggering.\n\nI know that body image is a sensitive topic. Even if the author is speaking about themselves, it can inadvertently affect others. The friend might feel that the author's comments about needing to lose weight (even in a self-deprecating way) are reinforcing negative stereotypes or making her feel worse about her own body. \n\nThe author says they agreed initially but now feel the request was unfair. But from the friend's perspective, it's a valid request. People have different triggers, and if someone's comments cause another person emotional distress, even if unintentionally, it's important to respect that request. \n\nSo, the author might not have intended to hurt, but they are in a position where their words impact someone else. The friend's request is about her own well-being, not about the author's right to discuss their body. Therefore, the author should respect the friend's boundaries, even if it feels unfair. \n\nThe answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions, though self-focused, negatively affected their friend, and respecting the friend's request is necessary.\n"
