I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who then got upset. The friend feels that when the author comments on their own weight, it makes the friend uncomfortable because they also need to lose weight. The author is now questioning whether they were wrong to agree to stop talking about their weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body, which is a personal issue. But the friend is taking it as a reflection on herself. The friend might feel that the author's self-criticism is judgmental or triggers her own insecurities. The author, on the other hand, thinks they're just expressing their own feelings and that it's not about the friend.\n\nIt's important to remember that while people have the right to discuss their own bodies, they also need to be mindful of others' sensitivities. If the friend explicitly said it's uncomfortable and asked to stop, then respecting that boundary is key. However, the author might not have realized that their comments were causing distress. But since the friend brought it up and the author agreed to stop, maybe the author is now second-guessing if it was fair.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author was talking about themselves, but if it's causing harm to the friend, then maybe they should consider the impact. On the other hand, the friend's request might be overreaching because the author's comments are self-directed. But boundaries in friendships matter. If someone feels hurt, the speaker should listen. So the author might be in the wrong not because they were talking about themselves, but because they didn't consider the friend's feelings in that context. Alternatively, the friend's reaction could be an overreaction. But the fact that the friend felt upset enough to ask the author to stop suggests that it's a valid boundary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary once it was set.\n"
