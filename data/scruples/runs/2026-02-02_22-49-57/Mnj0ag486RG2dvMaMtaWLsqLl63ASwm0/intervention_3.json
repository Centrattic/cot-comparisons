I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, which made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has body insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and needs to shop in plus-size stores. The friend got upset when the author talked about their own thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend feels that when the author comments on their own weight, it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her, since she needs to lose 70+ pounds. The author tried to reassure the friend, saying it's about themselves, but the friend asked them to stop. The author now feels it was unfair and is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is expressing their own insecurities, not criticizing the friend. However, the friend is sensitive because of her own weight issues. The friend feels that the author's self-criticism triggers her or makes her uncomfortable. The author is confused because they think they're not targeting the friend, but the friend is still hurt.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is talking about their own body image, which they have the right to do. But on the other hand, they might not realize that their self-criticism could affect others, especially someone who is already dealing with body image issues. The friend's reaction is valid because she's feeling judged or compared, even if the author didn't intend that.\n\nIn terms of social interactions, it's important to be mindful of how our words might impact others, even when we're talking about ourselves. If someone else has expressed that your self-talk affects them negatively, it's considerate to adjust, unless it's a one-sided issue where the other person is being overly sensitive without cause.\n\nIn this case, the friend has explained her feelings, so the author needs to respect that. While the author isn't directly insulting the friend, their self-criticism creates an environment where the friend feels self-conscious. So, the author's actions, even if well-intentioned, are causing harm. Therefore, the author should be more mindful and possibly avoid such comments around the friend. That would mean the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings in that context, even if it wasn't intentional.\n"
