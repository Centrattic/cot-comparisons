I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, who becomes upset. The friend feels it's rude because she's trying to lose weight and it makes her uncomfortable. The author argues that it's about their own insecurities and not about the friend.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about how talking about one's own body in front of someone else can affect that person, especially if they have similar issues. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but mentions their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend is in a plus-size category and is trying to lose weight. When the author talks about their own body negatively, it makes the friend feel judged or compare herself, even if the author didn't intend that.\n\nI think this is a common issue where people don't realize how their words might impact others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend could perceive it as a reflection on her own body. The friend's reaction is valid because she's dealing with her own weight loss journey, and hearing someone else talk about their body negatively might trigger her insecurities.\n\nThe author says they agreed to stop talking about it but now think it's unfair. But I think the friend's feelings are legitimate. The author might not have intended to hurt, but they should consider the friend's perspective. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because their actions (talking about their body) caused the friend discomfort, even if it was unintentional. The friend has the right to set boundaries, even if it's about how someone else talks about themselves.\n\nSo, even though the author is talking about their own body, the impact on the friend matters. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they need to respect the friend's feelings and adjust their behavior to accommodate her comfort. It's about empathy and considering how one's words affect others, even when discussing oneself.\n"
