I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nSo the situation is: the author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has body insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized. The author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend felt upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and it made her uncomfortable, thinking the author was comparing her. The author told the friend she looks great, but the friend still asked them to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, consider the friend's perspective. People dealing with their own weight issues might be sensitive to others' comments about weight, even if it's about themselves. The friend might feel triggered or judged, even if the author isn't targeting her. The friend's feelings are valid here. However, the author is talking about their own insecurities and body image, which isn't inherently rude. But maybe the friend feels that hearing someone else's self-criticism highlights her own struggles, making her feel worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to hurt the friend and even praised her. The author is addressing their own issues, which they have a right to do. But the friend's request is about her own emotional well-being. So, is the author's self-criticism causing harm? If the friend is directly affected, maybe the author should consider that. But is that the author's responsibility? \n\nIn social dynamics, sometimes people's actions impact others in unexpected ways. The author might not have intended to make the friend uncomfortable, but the friend's reaction is legitimate. The key here is whether the author's behavior, even if self-directed, is causing harm to the friend. If the friend explicitly states it's uncomfortable, then the author might need to adjust for the friend's sake, even if they don't see the connection. \n\nThe author says they know they shouldn't talk that way, implying they agree it's not healthy. But the question is about the friend's reaction. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the self-criticism could be a trigger. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were expressing themselves, but the friend's feelings are valid. However, the author should respect the friend's boundaries. The initial request to stop is a boundary, and the author agreed. Now they're questioning if that was fair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing their own insecurities, but the friend's reaction is valid. However, the author should respect the friend's feelings and perhaps avoid such comments if it's causing distress. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author wasn't intending to harm and was talking about themselves, but the friend is hurt, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the comments were about themselves and not directed at the friend. But maybe the friend's feelings are more important here. Hmm.\n"
