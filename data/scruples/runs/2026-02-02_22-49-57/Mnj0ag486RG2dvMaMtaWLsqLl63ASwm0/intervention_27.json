I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, talks about their own body being fat, and their overweight friend gets upset. The friend feels that when the author talks about their own weight, it makes the friend feel self-conscious about her own weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 125 lbs, which they mention is not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size clothing. The author was trying on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset, explaining that it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her because she needs to lose weight, and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author said they think their friend looks great, but the friend asked them to stop talking about needing to lose weight around her. The author initially agreed but now feels it was unfair and is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know the opinion. The answer should be A or B.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image, personal insecurities, and how one person's self-talk might affect another's self-esteem. The author is talking about their own body, but it's causing distress to a friend who is struggling with her own body image. Even though the author's intention is about themselves, the impact on the friend is negative. \n\nIn terms of social norms and empathy, even if someone is talking about their own body, if it's causing a friend emotional discomfort, it's important to consider that. The author might not have realized the effect their words had, but once it's pointed out, they have a responsibility to adjust their behavior if it's harming someone else. The friend's request is valid because even if the author isn't targeting her, the conversation is making her feel worse about herself. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel it's unfair because they were just expressing their own insecurities. But the issue isn't about the author's right to talk about themselves, but about the friend's emotional well-being. The author might need to find a way to address their own insecurities without bringing up weight in a way that affects others negatively.\n\nSo, considering that the friend's feelings are legitimate and the author's actions, even if unintentional, caused harm, the author might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong because they need to be mindful of how their self-deprecating comments affect others, even if those comments are about themselves.\n"
