I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when their friend gets upset about them talking about their own body. The friend is overweight, and the author, who is not overweight, mentions their own weight and body issues, which upsets the friend.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about the impact of self-criticism in front of someone else. The author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend, but the friend feels it's rude because it makes her uncomfortable. The author's friend wants them to stop talking about needing to lose weight in her presence. \n\nI need to consider if the author was wrong. Maybe the author didn't intend to hurt anyone's feelings, but the friend's reaction shows that their comments had a negative effect. Even if the author is being self-critical, doing so in front of someone who has their own body image issues could be triggering. The friend might feel that the author's comments reinforce negative body image, or make her feel worse about her own size. \n\nThe author says they agreed to the friend's request but now feel it's unfair. But the question is if they were wrong. The answer might depend on the friend's feelings and how the author's words affect others. Even if the author is just talking about themselves, if it makes someone else uncomfortable, especially someone with their own insecurities, maybe they should consider adjusting their behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities. But perhaps the issue here is about considering others' feelings. It's a bit of a sensitive situation where personal expression meets empathy. The friend's request is about her own comfort and well-being. So even if the author didn't mean to, their self-criticism might have been hurtful to the friend. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being considerate of how their words affect others. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their friend's feelings when discussing their own body, which made the friend uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
