I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is that the author is friends with someone who's overweight. The author isn't overweight themselves, about 125 lbs, but they have insecurities. When they were shopping, the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset, saying it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her because the friend is trying to lose 70+ pounds and it makes her uncomfortable thinking the author is judging her. The author says they told the friend she looks great and it's about themselves, but the friend asked them to stop, and now the author is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own body, which might seem like a personal issue. People often do body-checking or comment on their own appearance, which can be part of dealing with insecurities. But the friend is sensitive because she's in a different situation. Maybe she feels that when the author talks about their body, especially in terms of wanting to lose weight, it could trigger her own insecurities or feelings of shame about her larger size. \n\nNow, body image issues are a big deal for a lot of people. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend might interpret the comments as a reflection on her. Like, if someone else is in a larger body and hears someone else (even if that person is thinner) talking about needing to lose weight, it could make them feel worse about themselves. It's possible the friend feels that the author's comments perpetuate negative body image ideas or that the author's self-criticism indirectly criticizes her as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their own feelings. They are allowed to express their own insecurities. But maybe the friend is asking for the author to be considerate of her feelings. The author agreed initially but now feels the request is unfair. \n\nSo, the key here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can be hurtful to others, even if not directed at them. It's a matter of how the friend is receiving the information. Even if the author's intention is to talk about themselves, the impact on the friend matters. In relationships, considering how our words affect others is important. If the friend is clearly upset, then maybe the author should take that into account. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is not overweight but still has insecurities might make the friend feel that even people who are thinner can have issues, but in this case, the friend's own struggles are more severe. The author's comments might make the friend feel like her body is being compared or that she's being judged indirectly. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people don't realize how their self-criticism can affect others. It's possible that the author isn't being rude on purpose, but they are being inconsiderate. The friend's request is about her boundaries, so respecting that might mean the author is in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings. \n\nSo putting it all together, even if the author's intention was to talk about their own body, the impact on the friend is real. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words could affect the friend, even if it wasn't their intention. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
