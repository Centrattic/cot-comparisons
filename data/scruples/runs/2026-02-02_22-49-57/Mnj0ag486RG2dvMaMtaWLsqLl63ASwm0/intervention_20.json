I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is friends with someone who is overweight. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have body insecurities. During a shopping trip, the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and found the author's comments making her uncomfortable. The author tried to reassure the friend that it wasn't about her, but the friend asked the author to stop talking about weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but now feels it was an unfair request. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. But I need to decide between A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, the author is talking about their own body image issues. But the friend is sensitive to that. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might feel that the author is indirectly criticizing her or making a comparison. The friend's reaction is valid because people can be triggered by others' comments about weight, especially if they have their own struggles. \n\nThe author acknowledges that the friend looks great and that the comments weren't about the friend. However, the friend still felt upset. Sometimes, even if someone's intention is to talk about themselves, others might still feel that their own insecurities are being highlighted. The friend's request is about her own comfort and boundaries. \n\nIn many cases, when someone expresses dissatisfaction with their body, it can inadvertently affect others' self-esteem, even if they're not directly criticizing anyone else. The author's friend is setting a boundary here, which is her right. The author might not realize how their words impact others. \n\nBut the author is also being honest about their own insecurities. It's a tricky balance between self-expression and respecting others' feelings. However, the friend's request is about her own emotional well-being, so the author might need to respect that, even if they don't see the connection. \n\nSo, from a perspective of respecting others' feelings and boundaries, the author's comments, while about themselves, could be considered inconsiderate in this context. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their self-talk affects their friend. So the answer would be A.\n"
