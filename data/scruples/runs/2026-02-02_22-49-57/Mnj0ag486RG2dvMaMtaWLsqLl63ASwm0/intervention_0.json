I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author's comments made her feel bad, thinking it was about her. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but the friend is plus-sized and needs to lose 70 pounds. \n\nFirst, the author's intention was to talk about their own insecurities, not the friend. But the friend interpreted it as a comparison or a judgment. The author tried to reassure the friend that it wasn't about her, but the friend still felt uncomfortable. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author was talking about themselves, which is their right. On the other hand, maybe they should have been more mindful of the friend's feelings. However, the friend's reaction seems to stem from her own insecurities. \n\nThe author isn't directly criticizing the friend, just expressing their own body image issues. But maybe in that context, it's hard to separate personal insecurities from comparisons. However, the author isn't saying anything negative about the friend. The friend's request was to stop talking about needing to lose weight in front of her. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's statements were actually directed at the friend or if it's the friend projecting her own insecurities. The author isn't in the wrong because they are expressing their own feelings, but they might need to be more sensitive. However, the friend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't being rude. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
