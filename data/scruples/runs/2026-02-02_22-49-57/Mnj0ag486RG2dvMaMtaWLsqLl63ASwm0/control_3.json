I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their friend got upset because they talked about their own body. The situation is that the author is not overweight, around 125 lbs, but has insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, which made their overweight friend uncomfortable. The friend felt it was rude and asked the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author is now confused if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's friend is dealing with her own body image issues, needing to lose 70+ pounds. When the author talks about their own body in a negative way, even if it's about themselves, it might trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend is asking the author to be mindful of her feelings, which is a common request in relationships where someone's comments affect another person's self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is talking about their own insecurities. They might not have intended to make their friend feel worse, but they're now questioning if the friend's request is fair. The key here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative light can negatively impact someone else, even if it's not directed at them.\n\nI remember that in some psychology, people's self-esteem and body image issues can be sensitive. If someone is already struggling with their weight, hearing others talk about their own body negatively might make them feel like there's a standard they're not meeting, even if it's about a different person. So the friend's reaction is valid because her feelings are real, even if the author didn't mean to target her.\n\nAlso, the friend has asked the author to stop, and the author agreed initially but is now doubting. The question is whether the friend's request is reasonable. In relationships, when someone says something makes them uncomfortable, it's important to respect that unless there's a very good reason not to. The author might not have realized the impact of their words, but once they've been made aware, continuing the behavior could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, even though the author is talking about themselves, the way it affects the friend matters. The author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their comments might affect their friend's self-esteem, even if indirectly. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect her request to avoid making her feel worse. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
