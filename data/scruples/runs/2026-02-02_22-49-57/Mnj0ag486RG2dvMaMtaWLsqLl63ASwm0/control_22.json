I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is underweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset because it makes her feel bad about herself. The friend asked the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body, which they might feel is an insecurity. But the friend is sensitive about her own weight and feels that the author's self-criticism highlights her own insecurities. The friend is asking the author to be mindful of her feelings, which is a common social request when someone's behavior affects another person negatively.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that when someone's actions or words make another person uncomfortable, especially in a close relationship like friendship, the person causing discomfort should be considerate and adjust their behavior. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the impact on the friend is real. The friend's sensitivity is valid, and the author's actions, while self-deprecating, have a negative effect.\n\nThe author argues that their self-talk isn't about the friend and that they think the friend looks great. However, the friend's perspective is that hearing the author criticize their own body (even if it's about being underweight) triggers her own insecurities about being overweight. The author might not intend to hurt, but the result is that the friend is upset. The key here is about empathy and adjusting behavior to respect others' feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend explicitly asked them to stop and the author agreed, then continuing to do so after the request might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author feels the request is unfair. But in social contexts, mutual respect often involves making small adjustments for each other's comfort. So, even if the author feels it's unfair, if the friend is genuinely hurt by it, the author is at least partially responsible for considering the friend's feelings.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their self-criticism inadvertently harms the friend, and they should be mindful of that. However, it's a nuanced situation where the author isn't directly targeting the friend but needs to be aware of the impact. The line between personal expression and respecting others is thin here.\n"
