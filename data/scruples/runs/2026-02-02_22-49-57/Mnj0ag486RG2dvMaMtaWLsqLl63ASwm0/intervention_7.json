I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a person who is not overweight (125 lbs) but has insecurities. They have a friend who is plus-sized and needs to shop at plus-size stores. The author and their friend were shopping, and the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset and said it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her because the friend needs to lose 70+ pounds and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her, making her uncomfortable. The author then agreed not to talk about it in front of the friend but now feels it was an unfair request and is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe author is asking if they were in the wrong. They think they aren't, but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body, which is a personal issue. However, the friend is sensitive to this because of her own weight issues. The key point is that the author's comments about their own body might be triggering the friend's insecurities. The friend is not upset because the author is talking about themselves per se, but because it makes her feel judged or compares her to the author. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone talks about their own body in a negative way, it might unintentionally affect others, especially those who have similar or related body image issues. Even if the author is being self-deprecating, the friend might internalize it as a reflection on herself. \n\nThe author argues that it's about their own insecurities and not about the friend. But the friend's perspective is that it makes her uncomfortable. So the question is: is it rude to talk about one's own body negatively in front of someone who could be affected by it?\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, people have the right to express their own insecurities. On the other hand, if someone's expression causes discomfort to another, it might be considered inconsiderate. The friend's request is a valid emotional boundary. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. However, the friend's feelings are legitimate. \n\nThe author's comment about the friend looking great might not be enough if the friend is still feeling judged. It's possible the author's self-criticism is seen as a reflection on the idea that being bigger is bad, which could subconsciously affect the friend. Even if the author's intention is purely self-critical, the impact on the friend is real. \n\nIn many relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the friend feels that the author's comments are hurting her, then the author should consider that. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action might be inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they are causing their friend discomfort, even if unintentionally. Alternatively, maybe not, because they are expressing their own feelings. \n\nI think it's more about whether the author's actions, despite good intentions, are affecting the friend. If the author respects the friend's feelings and boundaries, then they should comply with the request. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" morally, but they are being inconsiderate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer could be A (yes) or B (no), depending on the perspective. \n\nIn some AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, if someone's actions, even if unintentional, cause harm, they can be considered the asshole. But if they are expressing their own feelings and the other person is sensitive, it's a bit more nuanced. The friend is asking them to respect her feelings. The author's initial agreement but later doubt suggests they are conflicted. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's actions, while about their own body, are impacting the friend's emotional state. Therefore, the author is inconsiderate and in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
