I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, which made the friend upset. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat. Their friend is overweight (plus size, needs to shop there) and got upset because when the author talks about their own body, the friend feels it's rude and makes her uncomfortable because she needs to lose 70+ pounds. The author said they were talking about themselves, not the friend, and the friend asked them to stop.\n\nThe author is asking if they were in the wrong. They think they're not, but want another opinion. \n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about body image and how talking about one's own body can affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, maybe the friend is comparing. Like, if someone else is talking about being fat when you're already trying to lose weight, it might trigger or make you feel worse. \n\nI remember reading that how people perceive weight and body image is complex. Even if someone is saying \"I'm fat\" when they're not, it might imply that a certain size is undesirable. The friend might feel judged or that the author's comments about their own body set a standard that the friend feels they don't meet. \n\nSo even though the author is talking about themselves, it's possible that the friend is interpreting it as a subtle criticism. The friend might be sensitive because they are trying to lose weight and the author's comments could make her feel worse about herself. \n\nThe author did agree to stop, but now feels it was unfair. But maybe the friend's feelings are valid here. The question is whether the author's self-deprecating comments were hurtful in this context. \n\nIn social interactions, sometimes what we say about ourselves can affect others, especially if they have insecurities. Even if the author's intention was just to vent or be self-deprecating, it might not be considerate of the friend's feelings. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words might impact their friend, even if it was about themselves. \n\nBut then again, people should be able to talk about their own bodies without being policed by others. However, the friend did ask them to stop, and the author is now conflicted. \n\nI think the answer here depends on whether the author's comments were inherently hurtful, even if not directed at the friend. Since the friend felt upset and asked for the author to stop, maybe the author should respect that. So, the author might be in the wrong not because they were wrong to talk about their body, but because they didn't consider the friend's perspective and feelings. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the comments were about themselves, the friend's reaction shows the impact was negative, and the author should have been more mindful.\n"
