I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their own thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend feels triggered, thinking the author is judging her since she also needs to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is not overweight themselves (125 lbs) but has insecurities. They were complaining about their own body image in a situation where their friend is dealing with similar issues but more severe. The friend's reaction is about personal triggers and discomfort, even if the author wasn't directly targeting her. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are about how one's self-talk can affect others, even when not intended. People with body image issues might find others' negative self-talk triggering, even if it's not about them. The friend's request is to stop talking about weight in her presence, which the author now feels is unfair. \n\nI should consider the dynamics of personal boundaries and sensitivity. The author might not have realized the impact of their words. The friend is asking for a boundary to protect her own feelings. The author's argument is that it's about themselves, but the friend's emotional response is valid. \n\nIn these situations, it's often about respecting others' feelings even if the intention was personal. The author's actions, while self-critical, might have caused harm. The friend's request is about her comfort, so the author might need to adjust their behavior to maintain the friendship, even if they feel it's unfair. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the author's self-talk, though not directed at the friend, still caused her distress. Respecting others' feelings and boundaries is important, even if the intent was not harmful.\n"
