I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, talks about their own body in front of their overweight friend, making her uncomfortable. The friend feels that the author's self-criticism triggers her own insecurities because she needs to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author mentions that they think their friend looks great and that their comments are about themselves, not the friend. But the friend's reaction is valid because she's taking the author's self-criticism and projecting her own insecurities onto it. People often compare themselves to others, especially in body image issues. The author might not intend to hurt, but their words still affect the friend.\n\nThe key question is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way is inherently rude when it affects someone else. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the impact on the friend matters. The friend asked the author to stop, which shows that the author's words have a direct effect on her emotional state. While the author might not see the connection, being mindful of how others feel is important in maintaining a healthy friendship. So even if the author's intent was self-deprecating, the action still has a negative impact, making them at least partially responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with their own insecurities, which are common. But in a friendship, respecting each other's sensitivities is crucial. The author may not be \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but they are inconsiderate of their friend's feelings. The line between self-expression and consideration for others is thin here. Since the friend explicitly asked them to stop and the author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair, there's a conflict in their perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author's comments are about themselves, the friend's feelings are valid. The author didn't mean harm, but their actions caused discomfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't take into account how their words affected their friend, even if unintentionally.\n"
