I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs and not overweight, mentions their own insecurities about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is plus-sized, feels upset because it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her, even though the author's comments are about themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is sharing their own insecurities, which might be part of their self-expression. However, the friend is sensitive about her own weight, and hearing the author talk about their own weight issues triggers her insecurities. The author says they told their friend she looks great, but the friend still feels uncomfortable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, everyone has the right to discuss their own body image without being blamed. On the other hand, if someone else is affected by it, maybe there's a consideration for the other person's feelings. The friend made a request, and the author initially agreed but now feels it's unfair. \n\nI need to think about the impact of one's words on others. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend's reaction indicates that it's causing her distress. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the effect is there. The key here is whether the author's actions were inherently rude, regardless of intent. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that they shouldn't talk that way in general, which shows self-awareness. However, they're conflicted about the friend's request. Social dynamics sometimes require adjusting behavior if it's hurting others, even if the topic is personal. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense, the friend's feelings are valid. If the author continues to talk about their body in a way that makes the friend uncomfortable, it might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in this scenario because they didn't take into account their friend's sensitivity, even if the comments were about themselves.\n"
