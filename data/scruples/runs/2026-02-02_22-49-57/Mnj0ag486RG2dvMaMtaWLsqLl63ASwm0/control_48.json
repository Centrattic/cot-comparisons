I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author talks about their own body, especially mentioning needing to lose weight, it makes the friend feel bad about herself. The author isn't sure if they were being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is saying that they're not overweight and are talking about their insecurities, but the friend is actually the one who is overweight. The author's comments, even if they're about themselves, might inadvertently make the friend feel worse about her own body. So even though the author is talking about themselves, it's possible that their words are triggering the friend's insecurities.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important here. She felt uncomfortable and asked the author to stop. The author initially agreed but now feels it was unfair. The key point is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can affect others, especially those with similar or different body image issues.\n\nI remember reading that even self-deprecating comments can be hurtful, especially if the listener has their own insecurities. For example, someone who is already struggling with weight might internalize the author's comments as a reflection on themselves, even if they're not directed at them. The author's friend might be comparing herself to the author, thinking that if the author, who isn't overweight, feels they need to lose weight, then maybe she (who is overweight) is even worse off. That makes sense because people often compare themselves to others, even if not intended.\n\nSo even though the author is talking about their own insecurities, their words can still impact the friend negatively. The friend's request is valid because she's communicating how those comments affect her. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the effect is there. The author might need to be more mindful of their words, especially in the presence of someone who has body image issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they are just expressing their own feelings and shouldn't be blamed for the friend's reaction. But the question is about whether the author was in the wrong. If the friend's feelings are hurt because of the author's comments, even unintentionally, then the author could be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words might affect the friend.\n\nSo the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the comments were about themselves, they had a negative impact on the friend's feelings, and the friend had the right to ask them to stop. The author's intention wasn't to harm, but the act of speaking negatively about their own body in front of someone with body image issues can still be considered rude or inconsiderate.\n"
