I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their friend who is overweight. The situation is that the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's also dealing with her weight and felt uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own insecurities, which is common. But the friend is in a different situation\u2014she's overweight and might be sensitive about body-related discussions. The author might not realize how their comments affect others, even if they're not directly talking about the friend.\n\nThe key point here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can be hurtful to someone else who has body image issues. Studies show that negative self-talk about weight can inadvertently stigmatize others or reinforce negative stereotypes. The friend might feel that the author's comments are indirectly criticizing her, even if that's not the intention.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they agreed initially but now think the friend's request is unfair. That suggests some conflict in their understanding. The friend's request is about her comfort, so the author's actions, even if well-meaning, might be causing emotional distress. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to be mindful of others' sensitivities, especially in close friendships. While the author is allowed to express their own insecurities, doing so in front of someone who is vulnerable about their body might cross a boundary. So, the author might be in the wrong here because they didn't consider their friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. The answer is likely A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
