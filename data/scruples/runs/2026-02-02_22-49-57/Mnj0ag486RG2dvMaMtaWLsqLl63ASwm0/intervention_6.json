I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs, called themselves fat in front of their friend who is overweight. The friend felt it was rude because she's trying to lose weight and it made her uncomfortable, thinking the author was comparing her. The author tried to explain it's about their own insecurities, but the friend still asked them to stop.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, self-criticism is a personal issue. People often talk about their own bodies, especially if they have insecurities. But the problem arises when it affects others. The friend's reaction shows that the author's comments made her feel judged, even if unintended. \n\nThe key here is intention vs. impact. The author didn't mean to hurt, but the friend was upset. The friend's sensitivity is valid because she's dealing with her own weight issues. Even if the author isn't targeting her, the context of being with someone who is overweight might make the friend feel compared against. \n\nHowever, the author isn't in the wrong for having insecurities or expressing them. But maybe they should consider how their words might affect others. The friend's request is about her comfort, so the author might need to adjust their behavior to respect her feelings. \n\nBut is the author actually wrong? If they're not intentionally being rude, maybe the issue is more about the friend's sensitivity. However, the fact that the friend was upset and asked them to stop means the author should acknowledge her feelings even if they feel it's unfair. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes) because the author's self-criticism, while justified, had a negative impact on the friend. The author should have been more mindful of how their comments might affect others, even if it's about themselves. But the user might think it's not the author's fault. Hmm. Alternatively, since the author isn't targeting the friend, maybe B is correct. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is unintentionally hurting someone, are they in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Usually, people are allowed to express their own body image issues. But if it's causing harm, maybe they should adjust. However, the author isn't directly targeting the friend. So perhaps the friend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for talking about their own body, but they should be considerate. The friend's request is valid, but the author isn't at fault for their own insecurities. However, maybe the author could have been more aware. But according to the question, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be B.\n"
