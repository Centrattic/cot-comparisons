I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments make her uncomfortable. The author argues that it's about their own insecurities and that they think the friend looks great.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The friend might feel that hearing someone who isn't as heavy as her criticizing their own body makes her self-conscious, especially if she's dealing with her own weight issues. On the other hand, the author might feel that they're just being honest about their insecurities and that it's not about the friend.\n\nBut the key point here is that the friend explicitly told the author that the comments make her uncomfortable. Even if the author's intentions are positive, the impact on the friend is negative. The author's actions, while self-critical, affect the friend's emotional state. The friend's request to stop making those comments is valid because people have different sensitivities. The author might not be doing it maliciously, but it's still important to respect the friend's feelings and boundaries.\n\nThe author's argument that it's not about the friend might not hold because even if it's about their own insecurities, the context of their friend's own struggles matters. The author is in a position of relative privilege (not being overweight) and their comments could unintentionally add to the friend's stress. It's about empathy and considering how their words affect others, even if they're talking about themselves.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They should respect their friend's feelings and adjust their behavior to not cause unnecessary distress, even if it's about their own insecurities.\n"
