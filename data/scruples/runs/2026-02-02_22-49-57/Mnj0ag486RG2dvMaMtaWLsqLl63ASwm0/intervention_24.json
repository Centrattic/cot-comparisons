I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset. The friend feels that hearing the author talk about their body makes her uncomfortable, especially because she herself needs to lose weight. The author is confused because they were just talking about their own insecurities and thought it wasn't about the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author mentions they have a good friend who is plus-sized and that they think the friend looks great. The problem arises when the author talks about their own body in a negative way, which the friend interprets as triggering or rude. \n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The author's intention was to express their own insecurities, but the impact on the friend was negative. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt the friend, the friend's feelings are valid. People with body image issues can be triggered by others talking negatively about their own bodies, especially if they perceive it as a comparison. \n\nThe author might argue that they were just being honest about their own feelings, which is fair. However, in friendships, especially with people who have different body types, it's important to be mindful of how your words affect others. The friend's request to stop talking about weight in front of her shows that the author's actions have a direct effect on her emotional state.\n\nAnother angle is the difference in their body sizes. The author is 125 lbs and isn't overweight, while the friend is in a plus-size category. When the author talks about needing to lose weight, the friend might feel judged or that the author is implying that the friend is the standard for being overweight. This can create a sense of comparison or insecurity for the friend. \n\nThe author might not see it that way, but the friend's reaction is real. Even if the author reassures the friend that it's not about her, the act of discussing their own body in a negative light can still cause the friend to feel self-conscious. The friend's request is a boundary, and respecting boundaries in a friendship is important for maintaining trust and respect.\n\nHowever, the author also feels that the request is unfair because they were just talking about themselves. There could be a misunderstanding here. The author might not realize the depth of the friend's sensitivity or the emotional impact of such conversations. It's possible that the friend has her own struggles with body image, and hearing the author talk negatively about their body, even if the author is smaller, might make her feel worse about herself.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but their words did cause harm. In terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but they are responsible for not being mindful of how their comments affect their friend. The friend has the right to set boundaries for her own comfort, even if the author's intentions were good. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a strong case for them needing to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings.\n"
