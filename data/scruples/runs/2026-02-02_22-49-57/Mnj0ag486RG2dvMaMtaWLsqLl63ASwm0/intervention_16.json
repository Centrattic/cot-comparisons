I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, who gets upset. The friend feels uncomfortable because she is trying to lose weight and the author's comments make her feel judged, even though the author is talking about themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making self-deprecating comments about their body, which might be a common way people deal with insecurities. However, their friend is in a different situation\u2014she is significantly overweight and is trying to lose weight. When the author talks about their own body, the friend might internalize it as a reflection on her own body image issues. \n\nThe key point here is the impact of the author's words on the friend. Even if the author's intention is to talk about themselves, the friend's reaction is valid because she's struggling with her own self-image. The author might not have realized that their self-criticism could trigger the friend's insecurities. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised to avoid negative body talk, especially in the presence of others who might be sensitive to such comments. However, the author is talking about their own body, which is their right. The challenge is balancing personal expression with being considerate of others' feelings. \n\nThe author's friend directly asked them to stop, which is a clear boundary. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. The question is whether respecting that boundary is necessary, even if the intent was not to harm. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author's self-criticism, while about themselves, inadvertently affects the friend. So, even though the author isn't intending to be rude, their words have a negative impact. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their friend feels, even if the comments are about themselves. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author isn't responsible for the friend's reaction if they didn't have prior knowledge. But since the friend communicated her feelings, the author should respect that. The answer hinges on whether respecting the friend's request is necessary, regardless of intent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's boundary after being told how their comments were affecting her. Even if the comments were about themselves, the friend's valid emotional response means the author should adjust their behavior.\n"
