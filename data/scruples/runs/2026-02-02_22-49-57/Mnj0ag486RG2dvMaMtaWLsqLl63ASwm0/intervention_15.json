I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about themselves being fat in front of their overweight friend, who got upset because it made her feel self-conscious.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and shops in plus-size stores. When the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, the friend got upset. The friend feels that the author's comments make her wonder what the author thinks of her since she needs to lose 70 pounds. The author says they told their friend she looks great and it's about themselves, but the friend asked them to stop talking about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image discussions and how they affect others. The author is talking about their own insecurities, but the friend is sensitive because of her own weight issues. The question is whether the author's self-criticism is inappropriate in this context.\n\nI need to consider if talking about one's own body in a self-critical way can unintentionally hurt someone else, even if the intent is personal. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend might feel compared to or judged, especially if she's struggling with her weight. The friend's reaction is valid because she's linking the author's self-criticism to her own insecurities. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is there. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were just sharing their own feelings and that the friend overreacted. But in terms of social dynamics, it's important to be mindful of others' sensitivities. The friend made a request to stop, so the author might need to respect that even if they feel it's unfair. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily being malicious, but their actions had a negative effect. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend was hurt and made a valid request, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words affect others, even if it's self-deprecating. So the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but there's a middle ground where both parties have valid points.\n"
