I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who then got upset.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is not overweight (125 lbs) but has body insecurities. They mentioned their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight while trying on yoga pants. The friend, who is plus-sized, felt upset because she's trying to lose weight too, and the author's comments made her uncomfortable. The friend said it's rude for the author to talk about their own body that way in front of her. The author agreed but now feels it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making self-critical comments about their body. Normally, talking about one's own body image issues isn't inherently rude. However, the friend has her own struggles with weight, so maybe the author's comments triggered her insecurities. The key point is whether the author's self-talk indirectly made the friend feel judged. Even if the author's intention was purely about themselves, the friend might feel that such comments create a comparison or imply that the author is critical of bodies, which could extend to her own.\n\nIn social interactions, people often have different sensitivities. Even if the author didn't mean to, their words might have made the friend feel self-conscious. The friend's request to not hear the author talk that way is about her own emotional well-being. The author might not see the connection, but from the friend's perspective, it's about feeling judged indirectly. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's self-criticism was inappropriate in the context of the friendship. Even if the author is being honest about their insecurities, the friend's feelings matter. The author's actions, though not malicious, caused emotional distress. Therefore, respecting the friend's boundaries by not making such comments in her presence would be the right approach. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a moral sense, but perhaps they are inconsiderate, which is why the friend asked them to stop. The correct answer here would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should consider their friend's feelings and adjust their behavior to respect her request.\n"
