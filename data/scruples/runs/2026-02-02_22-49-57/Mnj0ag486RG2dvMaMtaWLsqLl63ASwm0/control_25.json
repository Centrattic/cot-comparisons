I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author talks about their own body, specifically calling themselves fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size store, needs to lose 70 pounds, and feels uncomfortable when the author talks about their own weight loss goals.\n\nSo, the main question is whether talking about one's own body negatively is rude, especially when the friend is dealing with similar issues. The author argues that it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend is upset because it makes her feel judged. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the friend. If someone is already struggling with their body image, hearing someone else (even if they're thinner) talk negatively about their body might trigger their own insecurities. The friend might feel like the author's comments are a reminder of her own issues or that she's being compared unfavorably. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they're just expressing their own feelings and that they shouldn't be restricted from doing so. However, the friend has asked them to stop because it affects her. The key here is whether the author's actions, even if well-intentioned, are causing harm. \n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because she's expressing her feelings of discomfort. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact is real. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In social contexts, sometimes how our words affect others matters more than our intent. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend's feelings are a consideration. \n\nThe author says they agreed to stop initially but now feel it was unfair. The friend's request is about her own emotional well-being. The author could argue that they have the right to talk about their body, but at the same time, respecting the friend's feelings is important. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's often considered polite to be mindful of others' sensitivities, even if the topic is about oneself. The author's comments might inadvertently make the friend feel worse about herself. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's needs, even if the comments are about themselves. \n\nBut some might argue that the author isn't at fault because they're just being honest. However, given that the friend has communicated her discomfort and asked the author to stop, the author's continued behavior (if they didn't stop) would be the issue. The initial request is a boundary, and respecting that is part of being considerate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their actions, even if unintentional, caused harm, and the friend's request should be respected. However, others might say B (not in the wrong) because the author is just expressing their own insecurities and it's not their fault the friend was affected. But the key is that the friend asked them to stop, and the author continued, which is where the fault lies. Wait, the author says they agreed to stop but now feel it's unfair. The question is whether the friend's request was fair. If the author complied but now is questioning it, the initial request was valid. The main issue is whether the author's original comments were rude. \n\nI think the answer is A because even if the author was talking about themselves, the friend's feelings were hurt, and the author should have been more considerate. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
