I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in a way that upset their friend. The author is 125 lbs, considers themselves not overweight, but has body insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and feels hurt when the author talks about wanting to lose weight.\n\nThe author's friend says it's rude because she needs to lose weight too, and hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her uncomfortable, making her worry what the author thinks of her. The author agrees to stop but feels it's unfair. \n\nHmm. The author is talking about their own body, which they have the right to do. However, their friend is sensitive because she's dealing with weight loss and might compare herself. But the author isn't directly criticizing the friend; they're just expressing their own insecurities. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't consider that their words could trigger the friend's own issues. Even if it's about themselves, the context matters. If the friend is in a sensitive situation, the author's comments could be hurtful. However, the author didn't intend to harm. \n\nSo is the author wrong? Well, they're not intentionally being rude, but they might be insensitive. The key point is intent vs. impact. The friend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions were unintentional. However, respecting the friend's boundaries is important. The author agreed to stop, so maybe they shouldn't have agreed if they felt it was unfair. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the friend felt hurt and asked them to stop, and the author agreed but later found it unfair, there's a conflict. The author's actions, while not malicious, were still hurtful. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings once they were made aware of it.\n"
