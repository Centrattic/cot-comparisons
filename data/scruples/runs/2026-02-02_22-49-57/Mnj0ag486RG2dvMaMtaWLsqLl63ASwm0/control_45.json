I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is that the author is a friend who is not overweight, but they sometimes talk about their own body in a negative way, like saying they need to lose weight. Their friend is overweight and gets upset when the author does this. The friend feels it's rude and makes her uncomfortable because she is trying to lose weight too, and she's worried about what the author thinks of her.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about how talking about one's own body image can affect others. Even though the author is talking about themselves, their friend is taking it as a reflection on her own body. Body image issues are sensitive, and people can feel judged even if that's not the intention.\n\nThe author says they think their friend looks great and that the comments are about themselves. But the friend is still hurt and feels that the author's self-criticism makes her uncomfortable. The author then agrees not to talk that way in front of her, but later feels it was unfair. The main issue is whether commenting on one's own body in a negative way in front of someone else, especially someone with similar concerns, is considered rude or harmful.\n\nI think it's about empathy here. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, their friend is in a vulnerable place regarding her own body image. The author's self-criticism might trigger the friend's insecurities. So even though the author isn't intentionally being mean, the impact is negative. The friend has the right to ask for boundaries to protect her own feelings. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words affect their friend, even if it's about themselves.\n"
