I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They mentioned their friend is in a plus-size category. The author was talking about their own body, specifically their thighs and needing to lose weight and go to the gym. The friend felt that these comments were triggering for her, as she needs to lose 70 pounds. The author tried to explain it was about themselves, but the friend asked them to stop. The author now thinks the friend was unfair.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's wrong to talk about one's own body in a way that might negatively affect someone else's feelings. Even if the author isn't the one being criticized, their self-deprecating comments might trigger the friend's own insecurities. Body image issues are sensitive, and even when someone is talking about themselves, others might internalize those comments. \n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because she's struggling with her weight and the author's comments could make her feel worse about herself. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact is what matters here. It's about empathy. If the friend is affected by the author's words, then the author has a responsibility to consider that, even if the comments are about themselves.\n\nThe author might argue that they were just expressing their own insecurities, but the friend's feelings are still valid. The key point is whether the author's actions were considerate. Since the friend asked them to stop, the author should respect that request. It's not just about the words themselves but the context and the relationship. Respecting boundaries is important here. The author could find other ways to express their feelings without making the friend uncomfortable. \n\nIn conclusion, even though the author was talking about their own body, the impact on the friend is significant. The author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words might affect their friend's sensitive situation. So the answer is A (Yes).\n"
