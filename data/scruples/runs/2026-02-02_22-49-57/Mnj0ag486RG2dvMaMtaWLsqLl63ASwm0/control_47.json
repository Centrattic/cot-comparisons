I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author talking about their own body image issues in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and shops in plus size stores. The author mentions their own thighs looking large and needing to lose weight, which makes the friend uncomfortable. The friend feels it's rude because she needs to lose weight too and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is being rude by discussing their own body image issues in front of someone who also has body image concerns. The friend is upset because she might internalize the author's comments as a judgment of her own body. The author argues that it's about themselves, but the friend's reaction shows that it's affecting her.\n\nBody image issues are sensitive, and even when someone is talking about themselves, others might take it personally, especially if they have similar insecurities. The friend's request is about her comfort, so even if the author's intention was self-focused, the impact on the friend matters. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered empathetic to be mindful of how our words affect others. Even self-criticism can be hurtful if it's in front of someone who is vulnerable on that topic. The author agreed initially but now thinks it was unfair. However, the friend's valid reaction suggests that the author might have been inconsiderate without realizing it. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because the friend's feelings are valid, and the author should have been more considerate.\n"
