I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a friend of someone who is overweight. The author, who is 125 lbs and not overweight, has insecurities. They were shopping with their friend, tried on yoga pants, and complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and felt uncomfortable hearing the author talk about their own body, thinking the author might be comparing them or being negative in front of her. The author then agreed not to talk about it, but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong by talking about their own body in a way that made their friend uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I should consider the perspective of the friend. She might be sensitive because of her own weight issues. Hearing someone else talk about their body, even if it's just the author's own insecurities, could trigger her own feelings of insecurity. The friend feels that the author's comments make her wonder what the author thinks of her, which is uncomfortable. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might feel that it's a comparison or that the author is being negative about bodies in general, which affects her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they're just sharing their own feelings and that they shouldn't be restricted from talking about their own insecurities. The author is not overweight, so their comments are about their own body image issues, not the friend's. But the friend's reaction is valid because people can have different sensitivities.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone talks about their own body negatively, it can sometimes make others uncomfortable, especially if they have similar issues. The friend is asking the author to respect her feelings by not talking about that in her presence. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. However, the key here is whether the author's actions were rude or not.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, if someone is making another person uncomfortable, it's usually considered polite to adjust one's behavior. The friend is asking the author to stop a specific behavior because it affects her. Even if the author thinks it's about themselves, the impact on the friend is real. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings in this context. The author isn't necessarily wrong for having insecurities, but how they express them affects others.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because their comments, while about themselves, caused discomfort to the friend who has her own issues. It's about respecting the friend's boundaries.\n"
