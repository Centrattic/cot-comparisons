I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 125 lbs and has a friend who is overweight. The friend shops in plus-size stores. The author mentions their own insecurities and sometimes talks about their body, like when trying on yoga pants in a store. The friend got upset because she feels that when the author talks about their own weight, it makes her uncomfortable and makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author tried to reassure the friend that it's about themselves, but the friend still asked them to stop. The author now feels like that request was unfair but is questioning if they were being rude.\n\nHmm. The author is talking about their own body in front of their plus-size friend. The friend is sensitive to such comments because she herself is overweight and might feel judged or compared. Even if the author's intention is to talk about themselves, the friend is taking it as a reflection on her own body. \n\nI think this is a common issue with body image and how comments about one person's body can affect others. The author might not be intending to be rude, but the friend is hurt. The key here is whether the author's self-criticism is causing harm to the friend. The author is aware they are not overweight, but their friend is. So when the author talks about their thighs being large and needing to lose weight, the friend might feel that the author is implying that being bigger is bad, which could trigger her own insecurities. \n\nThe author's friend is asking them not to talk about their weight in front of her. The author initially agreed but now feels it was an unfair request. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, if your comments about yourself are making someone else feel uncomfortable, even if it's about yourself, it's important to consider their feelings. The author's friend's sensitivity is valid; people's reactions to body-related topics can be personal and emotional. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is still there. \n\nSo, even though the author is talking about themselves, the act of self-criticism in front of someone who is sensitive to weight issues could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's boundary is that she doesn't want to hear that, so the author's continued comments, even if well-intentioned, might be crossing a line. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because their actions (talking about their own weight) are causing their friend distress, even if unintentionally. Respecting others' feelings and boundaries is important, even when it's about your own body. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
