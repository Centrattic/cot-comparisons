I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their friend got upset when they talked about their own body. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they mentioned their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend is overweight and felt uncomfortable because she needs to lose 70 pounds. She told the author it's rude to talk about their body in front of her.\n\nHmm. The author is trying to explain that their comments were about themselves, not the friend. But the friend took it as a comparison. So the question is whether the author was wrong to talk about their own body in a way that made the friend uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, everyone has the right to express their own body image issues. But the problem here is that the friend was affected by those comments. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the friend felt judged. The key here is that the friend's sensitivity is valid. People with different body types might feel self-conscious when others, even if they're not the same size, talk about their weight. The author's friend might be comparing herself, even if the author wasn't intending that.\n\nAlso, the friend asked the author not to talk about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but later felt it was unfair. But if someone tells you a request, even if you think it's unfair, not respecting their boundaries could be seen as rude. However, the author is questioning if they were wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be A because the author's actions caused discomfort, even if unintentionally. The friend's feelings matter here. Even if the author was talking about themselves, the impact on the friend is what's important. So, the author is in the wrong for not considering how their words affected their friend.\n"
