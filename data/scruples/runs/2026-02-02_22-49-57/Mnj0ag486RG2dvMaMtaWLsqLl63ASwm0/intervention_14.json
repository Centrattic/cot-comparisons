I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complaining about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset because it made her feel self-conscious.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs, which they acknowledge is not overweight. They have a friend who is plus-sized and needs to shop in plus-size stores. The author has insecurities but isn't overweight. The problem happened when the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight and go to the gym. The friend felt upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds, and the author's comments made her wonder what the author thought of her. The author tried to reassure the friend that it wasn't about her, but the friend still asked them to stop talking about needing to lose weight around her. The author now thinks maybe the friend was unfair.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author is criticizing their own body, which is a personal issue. However, the friend is sensitive about her own weight and the author's comments triggered her insecurities. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the effect was there. \n\nIn situations like this, it's often about how the other person feels, even if the intention was good. The author's friend might feel that anyone talking negatively about their body, even if it's someone who isn't overweight, can reinforce negative body image for someone who is already struggling. The author's friend felt uncomfortable, so even though the author was talking about themselves, the impact was negative on the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they have the right to discuss their own insecurities. But maybe they should consider their friend's feelings. The key point here is whether the author's actions, despite being about their own body, were inconsiderate in the context of their friend's situation.\n\nI think the answer hinges on empathy and consideration. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a strict sense, but they could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the friend is clearly upset and asked them to stop, then the author should respect that. The fact that the author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair might indicate that they're struggling with their own feelings versus their friend's comfort.\n\nSo, the answer here is tricky. The author isn't malicious, but their actions had a negative impact. Depending on the perspective, the author could be considered in the wrong because they didn't consider how their friend might feel. Even if the intention was to talk about themselves, the context of their friend's own weight issues means that it's a sensitive topic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being considerate of the friend's feelings in that situation.\n"
