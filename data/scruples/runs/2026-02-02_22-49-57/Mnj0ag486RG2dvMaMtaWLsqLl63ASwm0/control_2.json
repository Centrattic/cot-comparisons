I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat. Their friend is overweight and shops at plus-size stores. When the author talks about their own weight (like in yoga pants), the friend gets upset because she feels it makes her uncomfortable, given that she needs to lose more weight. The author tried to reassure the friend that it's about themselves, but the friend still feels targeted.\n\nHmm. The key here is about how talking about one's own body image can affect others. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, their self-criticism might still trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend might feel that the author's comments are reinforcing negative body image standards, which could make her feel worse about her own body. \n\nBut the author says they are not overweight and have their own insecurities. They might not see the problem because they're talking about themselves. However, the friend's reaction suggests that the author's words are causing emotional distress. The question is whether the author should have considered how their self-talk might impact the friend's feelings.\n\nSome people might argue that it's okay to talk about your own body, but others might say that it's important to be mindful of others' sensitivities, especially if the friend has a history of body image issues. The author did agree not to talk about it in front of her, but now feels it was unfair. But the friend's comfort and emotional well-being might take precedence here.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to vent about themselves, the impact on the friend is valid. The friend's request to stop could be reasonable. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but they might be in the wrong in terms of not respecting the friend's feelings. The answer might lean towards A (Yes), because the author's actions, even if self-directed, caused harm to the friend's emotional state. However, there's a nuance here where the author might not have realized the impact. But the friend clearly communicated her feelings, so the author should respect that.\n"
