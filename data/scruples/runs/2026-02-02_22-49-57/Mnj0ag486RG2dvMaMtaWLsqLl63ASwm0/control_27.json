I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, which made the friend upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and feels insecure, so they mention their own weight issues. Their friend is plus-sized and feels that hearing the author talk about losing weight makes her uncomfortable because it reminds her of her own weight she wants to lose. The friend asked the author to stop, but the author now thinks it was unfair.\n\nHmm, the key point is whether talking about one's own body negatively is rude, especially when another person has body image concerns. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend's reaction is valid because it triggers her insecurities. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact matters here. \n\nThe author agreed to stop initially but now feels it's unfair. That's a conflict. On one hand, people have the right to discuss their own bodies; on the other, friends have boundaries. The friend's request is about her comfort, so the author might need to respect that even if they feel it's unfair. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author respects the friend's feelings and boundaries, then continuing to talk about their weight despite the request would be rude. But if the friend's request is based on her own insecurities and the author isn't being malicious, maybe it's a misunderstanding. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect her request to avoid causing discomfort. The author's intention doesn't negate the impact on the friend.\n"
