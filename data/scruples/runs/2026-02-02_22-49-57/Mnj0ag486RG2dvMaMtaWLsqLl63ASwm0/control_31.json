I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe author is a 125 lbs person who is friends with someone who is overweight. They were shopping, tried on yoga pants, and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset, explaining that because she herself needs to lose 70+ pounds, hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her uncomfortable and wonder what the author thinks of her. The author tried to reassure them but now feels the friend's request was unfair. The question is whether the author was being rude by speaking negatively about their own body in front of an overweight friend.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author is talking about their own body, not the friend's. But the friend has body image issues as well. The problem here is that even though the author is referring to themselves, the friend might be comparing and feeling judged. The author says they think the friend looks great, but maybe the friend isn't convinced or is sensitive. \n\nIn general, people can have different sensitivities. If someone is struggling with their weight, hearing a thinner person talk negatively about their own body might trigger their insecurities. The friend might feel that the author is indirectly criticizing her, even if it's not intended. So the author's actions, while self-directed, could be affecting the friend.\n\nThe author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair. But the friend made a specific request out of their own comfort. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author might not have meant to hurt, but the friend's feelings were affected. In such cases, respecting the friend's boundaries is important. Even if the topic is about oneself, if it's causing discomfort, maybe the author should avoid it around the friend. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they \"shouldn't talk like that anyways,\" which implies they're aware of the general unhealthiness of body criticism. However, the issue here is the impact on the friend. It's possible that while the author is being self-critical, it's also modeling negative behavior, which the friend might not want to hear. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though they were talking about themselves, they were causing their friend discomfort. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect that request.\n"
