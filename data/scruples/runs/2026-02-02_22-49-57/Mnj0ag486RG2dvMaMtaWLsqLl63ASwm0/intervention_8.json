I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and isn't overweight, but they have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and mentioned their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is plus-sized, felt uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too. She told the author it's rude to talk about their body around her.\n\nThe key points here: The author was talking about their own body, not the friend's. The friend is sensitive because of her own weight concerns. The author tried to reassure the friend that it wasn't about her, but she still felt hurt. The author is now questioning if they were unfair.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they were talking about their own insecurities, which isn't inherently rude. However, the friend's feelings are valid. Even if the author's comments were self-critical, the friend might have perceived it as a reflection on her own body. The author didn't intend to hurt, but the impact matters. The friend has the right to express her discomfort, and the author should respect that, even if they feel it's unfair. So while the author might not have malicious intent, they should consider the friend's feelings and avoid topics that cause her distress. Hence, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they need to adjust their behavior even if unintentional.\n"
