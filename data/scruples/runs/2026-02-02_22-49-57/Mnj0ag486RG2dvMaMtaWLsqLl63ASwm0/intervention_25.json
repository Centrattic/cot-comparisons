I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat, which upsets their overweight friend. The friend feels it's rude because she's trying to lose weight, and she's uncomfortable when the author talks about her own body in that way.\n\nHmm. So the author is talking negatively about their own body, but their friend is taking it as a reflection on herself. The author argues that it's about their own insecurities and not directed at the friend. But the friend is clearly hurt. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being rude. The author is talking about their own body, which is their right. But maybe the context matters. They're with their friend, and the friend is sensitive to such comments. The author might not realize how their words affect others, even if they're about themselves. \n\nThe friend's request is reasonable because she's uncomfortable. The author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. Is it unfair? Well, the friend is asking the author to respect her feelings. If the author's self-criticism makes the friend feel judged, then maybe the author should adjust their behavior, even if it's not intended. \n\nBut the author isn't targeting the friend, just expressing their own insecurities. However, sometimes people's self-talk can trigger others. It's a balance between personal freedom and considering others' feelings. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, empathy is key. The author might not be in the wrong, but perhaps they should consider their friend's perspective. The friend's feelings are valid, so the author might need to be more mindful. But was the author actually wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but they should be more considerate. However, the friend's feelings are valid too. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author isn't necessarily wrong for talking about their own body. The issue is the impact on the friend, which the author might need to address, but not that they are at fault for the comments themselves.\n"
