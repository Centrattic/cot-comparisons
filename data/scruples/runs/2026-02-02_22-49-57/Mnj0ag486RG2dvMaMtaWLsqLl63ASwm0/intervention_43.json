I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a friend of someone who is overweight. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They were shopping, tried on yoga pants, and complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose weight too and it made her uncomfortable. The author says they told their friend she looks great and that it wasn't about her, but the friend still asked them to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author agreed at first but now feels it was unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is already dealing with her own weight issues. When the author talks about their own body in a negative way, even if it's about their own insecurities, the friend might feel it's a mirror of her own struggles. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend might feel that the author's self-criticism is judgmental or triggering for her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own insecurities, which are common. People often talk about their own body image issues. The key point is whether the author's actions were inappropriate in the context of their friendship. The friend made it clear that this behavior makes her uncomfortable, so the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have been inconsiderate. \n\nThe author says they don't think they should talk about it, implying they realize it's not the best approach. But the question is whether they were in the wrong. If the friend expressed discomfort and asked them to stop, then the author's continued behavior (even if it's about themselves) could be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings. \n\nHowever, the author might not have intended to hurt the friend. It's possible that the friend's sensitivity is more about her own issues rather than the author's actions. But in a friendship, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. If the friend has communicated that the author's self-criticism affects her negatively, then the author might need to adjust their behavior, even if it's about themselves. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having insecurities or expressing them, but in the context of the friend's feelings, perhaps they were inconsiderate. The friend's request to stop is a boundary, and not respecting that could be seen as wrong. However, the author might not have intended harm, so it's a gray area. \n\nIn terms of answer A or B, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's comments were about themselves and they are allowed to express their insecurities. However, the friend's reaction is valid, and the author should be more mindful. But strictly speaking, the author isn't in the wrong for their own self-criticism; it's more about the friend's sensitivity. So the answer would be B.\n"
