I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about the author talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which makes their friend uncomfortable because the friend is trying to lose weight and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author says they think the friend looks great, but the friend still feels it's rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not targeting the friend directly; they're expressing their own body insecurities. But when someone else is struggling with their own body image, hearing someone else talk about their own weight loss goals might trigger them. Even if the author isn't aiming to hurt the friend, the impact is there. \n\nIn terms of communication, sometimes people might not realize how their words affect others, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like body image. The friend's reaction is valid because she's dealing with her own issues, and the author's comments might make her feel judged or compare herself more. However, the author might not have intended that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were talking about themselves, but maybe they could have been more considerate of how their friend might feel. However, the friend's request is also valid because she's uncomfortable. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. \n\nBut the main point is: was the author in the wrong for talking about their own body in a way that made the friend feel bad? Since the author was not directly criticizing the friend but was talking about themselves, maybe the fault isn't entirely on them. However, in social interactions, sometimes we need to be mindful of others' feelings even when discussing our own issues. So maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but they should adjust their communication to be more considerate. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they should consider the friend's feelings. \n\nAlternatively, since the friend feels hurt and the author's behavior caused that, even unintentionally, maybe the author is partially at fault. It's a bit tricky. In some perspectives, talking negatively about oneself can still affect others, especially those with similar insecurities. So the author might not be in the wrong in intent, but in impact, they might have done something wrong. But the options are only A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author wasn't targeting the friend, but maybe the answer could be A if the impact is considered. But since the author was talking about their own body and the friend's sensitivity is valid, maybe the author should have been more careful. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. In social norms, sometimes we expect people not to talk negatively about their bodies in front of others who might be sensitive. But is that a rule? Not sure. So maybe the answer is B, but it's a close call.\n"
