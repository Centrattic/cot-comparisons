I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their friend got upset when they complained about their own body. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is overweight, shops in plus sizes, and needs to lose 70+ pounds. During a shopping trip, the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend felt upset, thinking the author's comments made her wonder what the author thought of her and made her uncomfortable. The author tried to reassure the friend, but now feels the friend's request was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key point here is whether talking about one's own body insecurities in front of someone who is struggling with their weight is rude or insensitive. The author is not the one who is overweight, but their friend is. The author's comments about their own body might inadvertently trigger the friend's insecurities. Even if the author's intention was to talk about themselves, the friend could interpret it as a comparison or judgment. \n\nThe author did agree initially to stop talking about their weight in front of the friend but now feels it was unfair. But the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The friend's emotional response is valid because people's feelings about their bodies can be sensitive. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the impact is what matters here. So, the author might be in the wrong because their words affected the friend negatively, even if unintentionally. The fact that the author is not overweight and the friend is, could make the friend feel worse when hearing about body image issues, even if from someone else. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
