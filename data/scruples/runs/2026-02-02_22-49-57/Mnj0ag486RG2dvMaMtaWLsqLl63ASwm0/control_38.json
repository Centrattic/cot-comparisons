I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the friend gets upset when the author calls themselves fat.\n\nHmm, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores, so she's definitely overweight. The author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend felt it was rude and that it made her uncomfortable because she has her own weight issues. The author says they weren't talking about the friend, but the friend is still upset. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. From what I know, body image issues can be sensitive, especially when people with different body types are involved. Even if the author is talking about their own insecurities, someone else might take it as a comparison. The friend's reaction is valid because she's struggling with her own weight and hearing someone else talk about their own body negatively might trigger her. \n\nEven though the author isn't the one who's overweight, their comments could still unintentionally hurt their friend. The key here is that the friend's feelings are important, and if the author's behavior is making her uncomfortable, then maybe the author should respect her request. It's about empathy and respecting others' sensitivities, even if the comments are self-deprecating. \n\nThe answer is probably A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if they meant no harm, their actions affected their friend's feelings. It's about how the friend perceives it, not just the author's intention.\n"
