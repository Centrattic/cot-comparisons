I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author's comments made her feel self-conscious, even though the author was talking about their own insecurities.\n\nFirst, people often have body image issues, and it's common to express them. But the key here is the friend's reaction. The friend explained that hearing the author talk about losing weight made her uncomfortable because she has her own weight goals. Even if the author wasn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend felt it was rude because it made her self-conscious.\n\nThe author is 125 lbs and not overweight, while the friend is in a plus-size category. The author's comments about their own body might inadvertently trigger the friend's insecurities. Even if the author's intention was to focus on themselves, the impact on the friend is still valid. The friend asked them to stop, which is a boundary they should respect.\n\nHowever, the author might not have realized the effect of their words. It's possible they didn't mean to hurt the friend. But the friend made it clear that the comments affected her, so it's important to acknowledge that. The author should consider how their self-talk affects others, even if it's about themselves. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't intentionally being rude. But they are in the wrong in a way because they didn't consider the friend's feelings when discussing their own body image. Respecting the friend's boundaries is important for maintaining a healthy relationship. So even if the author didn't mean to, the act of continuing to talk that way after the friend expressed discomfort would be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't take into account the friend's feelings and boundaries after being made aware.\n"
