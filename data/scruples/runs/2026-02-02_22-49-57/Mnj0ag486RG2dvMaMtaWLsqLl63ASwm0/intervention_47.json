I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they talk about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, even though the author is 125 lbs and not overweight. The friend mentioned she needs to lose 70+ pounds and that the author's comments make her uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was rude by discussing their own insecurities. The author says they told their friend she looks great and that it wasn't about her. The friend asked them to stop, but the author now feels it was an unfair request.\n\nHmm. From a perspective of empathy, even if the author is talking about themselves, it can still affect others. The friend might feel that the author's negative comments about their body (even if they're not overweight) could trigger the friend's own body image issues. It's possible that the author's self-criticism inadvertently makes the friend feel worse about themselves, even if the author didn't mean to.\n\nBut the author is also being honest about their own feelings, which is a valid thing to do. The key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. The friend made it clear that the comments make her uncomfortable, so if the author continues despite knowing that, it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the author is just expressing their own insecurities and the friend is sensitive to that, maybe it's more about the friend's sensitivity than the author being wrong.\n\nBut the author was told to stop and then agreed but later felt it was unfair. The question is whether the friend's request was reasonable. In social contexts, people often have to be mindful of how their own comments might affect others, especially when there's a sensitive topic involved like body image. So even if the author is talking about themselves, if it's causing someone else distress, maybe they should be more careful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't directly criticizing the friend; they're talking about themselves. But the friend might still feel that the author's self-criticism indirectly criticizes her, given her own weight issues. So in that case, the author might be inconsiderate without being intentionally rude. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're being honest about their own feelings, but it's also important to be aware of how others might react. The friend's request to not talk about weight loss in front of her is a valid one, so if the author continues, they might be inconsiderate. However, the initial act of talking about their own body isn't inherently wrong. So maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they could be more considerate.\n"
