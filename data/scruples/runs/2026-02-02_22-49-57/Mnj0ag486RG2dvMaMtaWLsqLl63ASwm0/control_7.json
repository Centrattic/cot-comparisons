I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body weight in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which is probably not true based on weight alone. They have a friend who is overweight. When they tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, the friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70 pounds and it made her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair.\n\nThe core issue here is about how self-criticism affects others. The author isn't directly criticizing the friend, but their own negative comments might trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues. So, even though the author is talking about themselves, it's possible their words are hurtful because they can make the friend feel judged or compare herself to the author.\n\nI remember reading about how body image issues can affect social interactions. People with weight concerns might internalize societal standards, so hearing someone else talk negatively about their body, even if they're not overweight, could make them feel worse about themselves. The friend might perceive the author's comments as reinforcing negative body image standards that affect her as well.\n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt their friend, but the friend's reaction is valid. The key here is that the friend's feelings are important, and even if the author's comments are about themselves, they can still impact others negatively. The author agreed to stop, which shows they respected the friend's feelings at the time, but now they're questioning if it was unfair.\n\nSo, considering that the friend's request was to stop talking about weight in front of her because it makes her uncomfortable, the author's actions, while well-intentioned, did affect the friend. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-criticism could impact their friend's emotional state. It's not about right or wrong intentions, but about the actual effect on the friend. In relationships, respecting others' boundaries is important, even if those boundaries are about self-talk. The author's self-criticism, while personal, crossed into affecting someone else's comfort, making it a consideration of their wrong.\n"
