I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and acknowledges they're not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size store and needs to lose 70+ pounds. The author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, which upset the friend. The friend said it's rude for the author to talk about her body in front of her because it makes her uncomfortable. The author agreed initially but now thinks it was unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my take. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is talking about their own body. They're not directly commenting on the friend's weight, but their own. However, the friend is sensitive because she's working on her own body image issue. When someone talks negatively about their body, especially in front of someone who is also dealing with body image issues, it can inadvertently trigger the other person. The friend feels that the author's comments make her uncomfortable because she's comparing herself or feels judged, even if the author's intent is to talk about themselves.\n\nBut the author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend. The key here is intention vs. impact. The author's intention was self-criticism, but the impact on the friend was negative. In these types of situations, even if the words are about oneself, others can interpret it as a reflection on them, especially if they're dealing with similar issues.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might not have considered the friend's feelings in the moment. While the author might not have meant to hurt the friend, the act of self-criticism in front of someone who is also self-conscious can be harmful. The friend asked the author to stop, which is a valid request. The author complied initially but later questioned if it was unfair. However, the friend's request is about her emotional well-being, so the author might need to respect that even if the author doesn't fully understand why it's upsetting.\n\nOn the other hand, people often have the right to express their own insecurities. But in a friendship, especially with someone who is sensitive about their own body, the author might need to adjust their behavior to support the friend. The author's actions, even if unintentional, caused distress. The friend's reaction is valid because she's in a vulnerable position, and the author's self-criticism could make her feel worse about herself.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions had a negative impact, even if not intended. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings and boundaries. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
