I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own weight in front of their friend, who is also overweight.\n\nFirst, the friend is upset because when the author talks about their own body, it makes her feel self-conscious. The author is at 125 lbs and not overweight, while the friend is in a plus-size category and needs to lose weight. The author argues that their comments are about themselves and not about the friend, but the friend feels it's rude. \n\nSo, the key points here are about how one person's self-talk affects another. Even though the author is talking about their own body, the friend interprets it as a comparison or judgment. The author might not intend to hurt the friend, but the friend is hurt. \n\nIn social situations, it's important to consider how our words might impact others, even if we're referring to ourselves. If the friend is already struggling with her own body image, hearing someone else talk negatively about their body\u2014even if it's not the same issue\u2014might trigger her insecurities. \n\nThe author did agree to the friend's request initially but now feels it's unfair. However, the friend's feelings are valid. The question is whether the author is wrong for making those comments. \n\nI think the author's intention isn't malicious, but the effect on the friend is real. So, even if it's not a direct attack, the author might still be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings. The best approach is to respect the friend's boundaries and find other ways to discuss personal insecurities without making the friend uncomfortable.\n"
