I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation first. The author is an overweight friend of someone who is larger, and when the author talks about their own body in a negative way, like saying they're fat and need to lose weight, their friend gets upset. The friend is sensitive because she's also dealing with body image issues, needing to lose 70+ pounds, and the author's self-talk makes her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nThe author says they think their friend looks great and that this wasn't about her, but the friend still feels it's rude. The question is whether the author was wrong to talk about their own body in front of her. \n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is talking about their own insecurities, which they have a right to express. But on the other hand, the friend is clearly affected by it. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, their comments might trigger the friend's own issues. The key here is about being considerate. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's reaction shows that it's causing her distress. \n\nIn situations where someone's self-talk affects another person's feelings, it's often about the impact rather than the intent. So, even if the author is just venting their own insecurities, if it's making their friend feel bad, then maybe they should adjust their behavior. The friend asked them to stop, and the author agreed but now feels it was unfair. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for having insecurities or expressing them, but they might not have considered how their words affect their friend. However, the friend's sensitivity is also valid. The author could be blamed for not being considerate, but it's a mutual situation. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" Since the friend's feelings are important and the author's comments are causing her distress, even if unintentionally, the author might be in the wrong for not stopping when they saw the friend's discomfort. \n\nBut wait, the author did apologize and agreed to stop. Now they're questioning if that was unfair. The friend's request is reasonable because she's uncomfortable. So the author might not be in the wrong for the initial comment, but once the friend expressed her feelings, continuing would be the wrong. Since the author did agree to stop, maybe they are not in the wrong. But the act of talking about their body in front of someone sensitive could still be considered rude, even if it's about themselves. \n\nI need to decide between A and B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I have to consider if the author's own self-talk is inappropriate in front of a friend who has body image issues. It's a bit of a grey area. Some people might say it's not the author's fault for expressing their own insecurities, while others might say they should be more mindful. The friend's feelings are valid, so the author's actions, even if self-focused, still had a negative impact. Therefore, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their self-talk inadvertently hurt their friend, even if unintentional.\n"
