I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their friend got upset when they called themselves fat. The friend is overweight and asked the author not to talk about their own weight in front of her. The author feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and is working on losing weight. The author was talking about their own body image in front of the friend, which made the friend uncomfortable. \n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable. People who are working on losing weight might be sensitive to discussions about body image, even if the comments are about oneself. It's possible that the author's self-criticism triggered the friend's own insecurities or made her feel judged, even unintentionally. \n\nHowever, the author didn't mean to criticize the friend. They mentioned that their friend looks great and that the comments were about themselves. But sometimes, when someone in a lower weight category talks about their own body in a negative light, it can inadvertently affect others, especially those who are struggling with their weight. \n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author didn't intend to hurt their friend, but the impact was negative. The friend felt that the author's self-talk made her question how she's perceived. Even if the author's self-talk is about their own insecurities, it's possible that the friend internalized it as a comparison. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The friend asked the author not to talk about losing weight in her presence anymore. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. The question is whether the author is wrong for not respecting that boundary after agreeing to it. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel it's their right to discuss their own body image. On the other, the friend has a right to set boundaries for her comfort. The author's self-talk, while about themselves, might not be the best in this context. \n\nSo, the author's intent was not to harm, but the impact was real. The friend's request is valid because she's dealing with her own weight issues. The author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings, even if it's about their own insecurities. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider how their self-talk affected their friend, even if unintentionally.\n"
