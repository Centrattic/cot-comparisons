I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when their friend gets upset because they talk about their own weight. The situation is that the author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which makes their overweight friend uncomfortable. The friend feels it's rude and makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own body, which is their right. But the friend is feeling upset because she has her own weight issues. The friend might feel that the author's comments are judgmental or could be comparing herself to the author. Even if the author isn't intending to be mean, the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nThe key here is about how one's self-talk can affect others, especially friends with similar insecurities. The author might not be aware that their comments are triggering the friend's insecurities. The friend is asking them to stop, which is a reasonable request if it's causing her discomfort. The author agreed initially but later feels it was unfair. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered polite to be mindful of how your comments affect others, even if they're about yourself. So even if the author isn't being intentionally mean, they might still be in the wrong because their words hurt their friend. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because they should consider their friend's feelings and adjust their behavior if it's causing harm.\n"
