I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about their own body negatively in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset because she's struggling with her weight too.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are 125 lbs, so not overweight, while their friend is in a plus-size category. The author was trying on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend was upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and felt the author's comments made her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thought of her.\n\nThe author argues that they were just talking about themselves and didn't mean to hurt the friend. They agreed not to do it anymore but now think it was unfair. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an opinion.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. When someone talks negatively about their own body, especially in front of someone else who is also dealing with body image issues, it's possible to unintentionally hurt them. Even if the comments are self-directed, the friend might internalize them, comparing herself to the author. The author's friend has a valid reason to feel uncomfortable because the author's self-criticism could trigger her own insecurities.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was self-criticism, not to target the friend. The question is whether the author should have been more mindful of the friend's feelings. Since the friend explicitly asked them to stop, respecting that boundary is important. The author's own insecurities don't negate the friend's hurt feelings, but the author might not have realized the impact of their words.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while it's not malicious, the author could have considered the friend's perspective. The friend's request to stop is valid, so the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. However, the situation is nuanced because both parties have insecurities. The key point is whether the author should have anticipated the friend's reaction. Since they now agree not to do it but feel it's unfair, maybe the answer is not a clear A or B. But since the friend asked them to stop and the author initially agreed, it's more about respecting the friend's feelings. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because even if unintentional, the comments hurt the friend and she asked them to stop for a valid reason.\n"
