I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she needs to lose weight and the author's comments made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has body insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and is trying to lose weight. When the author talks about their own body negatively, the friend feels it's rude and makes her self-conscious. The author is confused because they were just talking about themselves, not the friend.\n\nSo, the key here is about how personal comments about one's body can affect others, especially friends with similar issues. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the friend's reaction is valid. People often compare themselves to others, so when someone thinner talks about their insecurities, it can make a heavier person feel worse about themselves.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The friend's feelings are important. Even if the author was talking about themselves, the impact on the friend matters. The friend asked them to stop, and the author is now unsure if that was fair. \n\nIn some cases, people might think talking about their own body isn't the other person's problem. But in close friendships, being considerate of each other's feelings is important. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could be in the wrong for not considering how their words affect their friend. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes) because the friend's feelings were hurt, and the author should have been more mindful. However, it's also possible that the friend's reaction is a bit unfair, making it a B. But the key point here is that the friend felt uncomfortable and asked the author to stop. The author agreed initially but then doubted. The friend's request is valid, and the author's actions did cause distress. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not respecting the friend's feelings, even if unintended. So the answer is A.\n"
