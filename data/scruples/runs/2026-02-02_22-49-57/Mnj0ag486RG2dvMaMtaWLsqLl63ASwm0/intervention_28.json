I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author's comments made her feel self-conscious. The author says they were just talking about their own insecurities and not targeting the friend, but the friend feels it's rude.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about how the author's actions affected the friend. Even if the author was talking about themselves, the friend is in a situation where she's already dealing with her own body image issues. When someone else, even a friend, comments negatively about their body in front of her, it can trigger her insecurities. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact is real. \n\nThe author mentions they agreed to stop doing that initially but now feel it was unfair. But the friend's request was about her comfort and mental well-being. Respecting someone's feelings, even if the action wasn't malicious, is important in a friendship. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because they didn't consider the effect of their words on the friend. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should have been more mindful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were just being honest about their own insecurities. But the context is that the friend is in a similar but more severe situation, so the author's comments, while self-deprecating, could be triggering. So even if it's about themselves, it's still affecting the friend negatively. Therefore, the answer might be yes, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's boundaries and feelings.\n"
