I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when they call themselves fat. \n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and acknowledges they're not overweight but have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores and needs to lose 70+ pounds. The friend feels uncomfortable when the author talks about their own body in that context, thinking the author is comparing or making them feel worse.\n\nThe author tried to explain that it's about their own insecurities, but the friend still asked them to stop. Now the author is questioning if this was an unfair request.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel they're just being honest about their own body image. However, the friend's sensitivity makes sense because when someone who isn't overweight talks about their weight, it can inadvertently make the friend's struggles feel minimized or criticized. \n\nEven if the author's intention is to address their own insecurities, the impact on the friend is real. The friend might feel that the author's comments create a negative environment, making them self-conscious or feel judged. \n\nThe author did agree to stop initially but now feels it was unfair. But the key here is the friend's emotional response. The author's actions, even if self-directed, caused discomfort. In such cases, respecting the friend's feelings and boundaries is important, even if the author didn't intend to hurt anyone. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong entirely, but their actions did have a negative impact. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The friend's valid feelings and the request to stop talking about weight in front of them suggest that the author should have been more mindful. \n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because their self-talk inadvertently affected the friend's emotions, and agreeing to the friend's request shows that the author's actions were indeed problematic.\n"
