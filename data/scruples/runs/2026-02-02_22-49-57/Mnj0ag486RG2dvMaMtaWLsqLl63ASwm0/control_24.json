I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the friend got upset when the author mentioned their own weight and need to lose weight, even though the author isn't overweight. The author tries to reassure the friend, but the friend feels uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have their own insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and feels that the author's comments about their own body make her question how the author perceives her. The friend asked the author not to talk about needing to lose weight anymore, which the author agreed to but now feels it was unfair.\n\nThe key points are about body image and how self-criticism can affect others, especially friends with similar or different body issues. The author is criticizing their own body, but the friend is sensitive because she has her own struggles. The question is whether the author was rude by talking about their own body in front of the friend.\n\nI think the issue here is about empathy and awareness of others' feelings. Even if the author is talking about their own insecurities, if it causes discomfort to the friend, then it's something to consider. The author's friend might be comparing herself to the author or feeling that negative body talk is judgmental. The author's friend's sensitivity is valid because people with body image issues can be triggered by others' negative comments, even if they're about themselves.\n\nHowever, the author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's feelings are real. The author's own insecurities don't negate the impact on the friend. So, even though the author wasn't directly criticizing the friend, the act of talking about their own body in a negative way in front of someone who is struggling with their weight can be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the author is talking about themselves, it's affecting the friend's comfort and self-esteem. The author should be considerate of the friend's feelings and avoid such conversations if they cause distress. The friend's request was to stop talking about needing to lose weight, so the author's continued complaints are not respecting that boundary, making them at fault.\n"
