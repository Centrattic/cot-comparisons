I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, and the friend gets upset because it makes her uncomfortable. The friend needs to lose a significant amount of weight, and the author's comments make her wonder what the author thinks of her. \n\nFirst, the author's intention is important. The author says they're talking about themselves, not the friend, and they even tell the friend she looks great. But the friend is still hurt by it. The question is whether talking about one's own body image issues is rude when it affects someone else negatively.\n\nI need to consider the friend's perspective. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend might feel self-conscious or compare herself to the author. The author's insecurity might be triggering the friend's own insecurities. The friend's request to stop is about her emotional well-being.\n\nThe author argues that it's about themselves, but actions that hurt others can still be problematic, even if unintended. The key here is the impact on the friend. Even if the author didn't mean to, the friend is upset. The author might need to respect the friend's feelings and adjust their behavior to maintain a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since the friend is clearly affected and asked to stop, the author's continued behavior despite knowing the impact could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards A, but some might argue B if they think the author isn't at fault. However, in such situations, considering the feelings of others is important. So, likely A.\n"
