I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their plus-sized friend, and the friend gets upset. The friend says it makes her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nHmm. The author says they're just talking about their own insecurities and that they think the friend looks great. But the friend feels that when the author talks about their own body negatively, it's triggering for the friend because of her own weight issues. The author initially agreed to stop doing that but now feels it's an unfair request.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key here is whether the author's words, even if they're about themselves, are causing harm to their friend. People can have different sensitivities. Even if the author isn't directly targeting the friend, the friend is affected by the author's self-criticism. \n\nI remember that in relationships, especially close ones, people's feelings are important. If someone's actions (even if it's just talking about themselves) are hurting another person, then there's a responsibility to consider that. The friend is being honest about her feelings, so the author should probably respect that. \n\nThe author might feel that it's their right to talk about their own body, but in this case, it's affecting their friend. So the author needs to adjust, even if it's not a direct insult. It's about empathy and understanding the other person's perspective. \n\nI think the answer here is A, meaning the author is in the wrong because their friend's feelings matter, and they should make an effort not to bring up their own insecurities in a way that makes the friend uncomfortable. Even though the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the impact is there, and being considerate is important in maintaining a good friendship.\n"
