I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is not overweight at 125 lbs, is friends with someone who is significantly overweight. The friend gets upset when the author talks about their own body negatively, like complaining about their thighs and wanting to lose weight. The friend says it's rude and makes her uncomfortable because she's also trying to lose weight and it triggers her insecurities.\n\nThe author admits that maybe they shouldn't talk like that in general, but they feel the friend's request was unfair. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship and how self-talk can affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, their comments might inadvertently make the friend feel judged or worse about herself. The friend is already struggling with her own body image, so hearing someone else, even a friend, talk negatively about their body might make her feel that her own issues are being highlighted. \n\nIt's possible that the author didn't intend to hurt their friend's feelings, but the friend's reaction is valid. People can have different sensitivities, especially when it comes to body image. Even if the author is not the one being criticized, the act of self-criticism can still be triggering. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were respectful towards their friend's feelings. The friend asked them not to do it, so even if the author thinks it's about themselves, the impact on the friend is real. The author might need to consider that their words, even if self-deprecating, can have unintended consequences on others. \n\nHowever, the author might also feel that they have the right to express their own insecurities. But in a close friendship, there's an expectation to be mindful of each other's sensitivities. So the author might be in the wrong if they continue to do it despite the friend's request, but the initial act of self-criticism isn't inherently wrong. \n\nBut the friend's reaction is about how the author's self-talk affects her. So it's a matter of considering the friend's feelings. The author agreed initially but then felt it was unfair. The question is whether the friend's request is reasonable. \n\nIn such cases, it's often about perspective. The author might not see the connection between their own self-talk and the friend's feelings, but the friend does. So the author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings, making the author in the wrong if they persist. However, if the author is not intentionally targeting the friend, maybe it's not entirely their fault, but they should still be considerate.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their self-criticism, while not directed at the friend, still causes the friend distress, and the friend has a valid reason to ask them to stop. The author should be more mindful of how their words affect others, even when they're talking about themselves.\n"
