It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves a wedding where the author was invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The soon-to-be bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick people up, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset, and the author is confused because they felt they didn't break the promise since the invitation came from the other person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone, which the author agreed to. However, the author didn't initiate the interaction; a bridesmaid approached them. But the key point here is that the author didn't refuse the invitation. Even if the bridesmaid initiated, accepting could still be seen as crossing a line, especially since the author was at a wedding where they had been explicitly asked not to flirt. \n\nThe bride's anger might stem from the perception that the author was still engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. The author argues they didn't break the promise because they didn't approach anyone. However, the act of accepting the invitation might still be problematic, as it could be seen as going against the spirit of the bride's request. \n\nAlso, the social norms around weddings are such that guests, especially those of the ex's partner, might expect a certain level of decorum. Even if the author wasn't actively hitting on anyone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful to the bride. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly promise to avoid all social interactions, just not to hit on women. The line between social mingling and hitting on someone can be blurry. The author claims they were just having a good time. However, the specific incident with the hotel room might be the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. If the author didn't mean to hit on the bridesmaid but accepted an invitation that could be perceived as such, they might be in the wrong. The bride's feelings are valid, even if the author's actions were not explicitly against the promise. The key is whether the author respected the bride's boundaries beyond the explicit promise. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because accepting the invitation, even if initiated by someone else, still goes against the bride's expectations and could be seen as disregarding her wishes, especially in a sensitive setting.\n"
