It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is at their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The soon-to-be bride told the author not to hit on any women there. The author thought that was weird but agreed. At the wedding, they're just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Then a bridesmaid invites them to her hotel room, and they accept. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo the author's defense is that they didn't go looking for someone to hit on; it was the other way around. The question is whether they're an asshole for not turning her down.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement with the bride not to hit on anyone. The author didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid approached them. But does that matter? If the bride made a direct request, even if it's a bit odd, the author was supposed to avoid any behavior that could be seen as hitting on someone. By going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid, even if it was her idea, it might still be perceived as participating in something the bride wanted to avoid. \n\nAlso, the situation is at a wedding, which is a sensitive place. Even if the author didn't make the first move, accepting the invitation could be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The bride might feel that the author is still engaging in behavior she asked him not to do, which could cause her distress. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author claims they weren't trying to hit on anyone, just enjoying the wedding. The fact that someone else initiated might matter. However, in such situations, people might not distinguish between the two. The bride might feel betrayed regardless of who made the first move. \n\nSo, considering social norms and the context of a wedding, even if the author didn't actively pursue someone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't make the first move.\n"
