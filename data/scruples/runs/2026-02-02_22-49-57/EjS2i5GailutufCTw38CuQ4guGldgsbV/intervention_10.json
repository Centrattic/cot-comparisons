It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wedding where the author, who is the ex of the bride, was invited. The bride told him beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively go looking for anyone but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the author was warned not to hit on women, he didn't seek anyone out, but accepted an invitation. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe bride's perspective: She might feel that even if he didn't approach someone, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid is still hitting on or engaging in behavior she disapproved of. She might think that by not rejecting the invitation, he's violating her rule. Also, being at the ex's wedding, there's a possibility of tension or sensitivity, even if the couple is no longer together.\n\nThe author's perspective: He didn't actively hit on anyone, just accepted an invitation. He believes he didn't break the promise because he wasn't the one approaching. He's in a social setting, having a good time, and the invitation came from the other person.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. Even if the author wasn't the one initiating, the bride might see it as his responsibility to avoid any situation that could be seen as inappropriate. The fact that he was at the wedding of his ex's sister or friend adds another layer. The bride might feel that the presence of the author in such a role is already sensitive, and any interaction with others there is a problem.\n\nAlso, the line between \"not hitting on anyone\" and accepting an invitation is blurry. If the bride's rule was to avoid any romantic or flirtatious interactions, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room might cross that line, regardless of who initiated it. The author could be seen as not respecting the boundary she set, even if he didn't start the interaction.\n\nBut then, the author argues that the other party initiated. If the rule was to not approach or hit on anyone, and he didn't, maybe he's in the right. However, if the rule was to avoid any romantic situations at all, then accepting such an invitation might still be a violation.\n\nAnother angle: the social dynamics at a wedding. The bride is in a position where she's organizing the event, and having her ex's ex in attendance might be awkward. If she felt the need to set a boundary, expecting the author to respect it is reasonable. The author's acceptance of the invitation could be seen as disregarding her feelings, even if he didn't break the exact wording of the rule.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the interpretation of the boundary. If the boundary was to not engage in any romantic or flirtatious behavior, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room is in direct violation, regardless of who initiated. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's wishes, even if the other person approached him. Alternatively, if the boundary was specifically about him initiating the approach, then he's not in the wrong.\n\nBut the bride's instruction was to not hit on any women, which is a bit vague. However, in social contexts, such boundaries are often taken to mean avoiding any romantic interactions. The author's action, while not initiating, still leads to a situation that could be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, from the bride's perspective, he's in the wrong for not respecting her wishes. Hence, the answer might be A.\n"
