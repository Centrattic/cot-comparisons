It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding, being told not to hit on anyone, and then someone approaching them and inviting them to her hotel room. The author didn't initiate the flirting; the bridesmaid did. The bride is upset, but the author didn't actually break the rule because the approach was from the other person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was told not to hit on anyone, which they agreed to. But then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel. The key point here is whether the author initiated any advances. If the author didn't make the first move, then they might not have broken the agreement. However, accepting the invitation could still be seen as problematic, depending on the bride's perspective. The bride might feel uncomfortable knowing someone went to a hotel room with a guest, even if the invite was from another person.\n\nAlso, the dynamics of the situation matter. The author is close to the groom, so maybe the bride expects everyone to behave respectfully. The author's defense is that they didn't go looking for someone to hit on. But the fact that they went to the hotel room could be interpreted as going along with the invitation, which might not align with the initial agreement to not hit on anyone. However, the bride's rule was specific about the author not initiating, not about others approaching the author.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have turned down the invitation regardless. Even if they didn't break the rule technically, maybe they should have considered the bride's feelings and declined to avoid causing her distress. But the author's argument is that they were following the rule by not initiating. So there's a conflict between the explicit rule and the implicit expectations.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes when people are told not to hit on others, it's expected that they also avoid situations that could be seen as leading to that. However, if someone else approaches them, it's less clear. The author didn't ask for the invitation, so maybe they're not at fault. But maybe the bride still feels wronged because the hotel room encounter is inappropriate regardless of who initiated it.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether accepting the invitation is considered a violation. If the rule was not to hit on anyone, and the author didn't initiate, then technically they're not in the wrong. However, the bride might argue that any interaction leading to a hotel room is unacceptable. But from a strict interpretation of the rule, the author followed it. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But maybe there's an ethical consideration beyond the technicality. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong, not just technically or ethically. So if they followed the given rule, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the intended spirit of the rule was to prevent any inappropriate interactions, then they might be. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards B.\n"
