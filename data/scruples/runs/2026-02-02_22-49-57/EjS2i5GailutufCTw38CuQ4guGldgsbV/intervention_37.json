It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person described in the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves a wedding where the ex got married, and the person in question was invited because they're close with the groom. The bride had explicitly told the person not to hit on any women, which the person thought was odd but agreed to. However, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted, leading the bride to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person was at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive event. The bride had made a direct request not to hit on anyone, which the person thought was strange but didn't refuse. Then, a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room. The person went there, and the bride is now upset. The person argues that they didn't initiate the approach, so they didn't break the promise they made to the bride.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and expectations. At a wedding, especially one involving an ex, there's an expectation of maintaining boundaries. The bride's request, while perhaps heavy-handed, was a direct instruction. The person in question might feel that since they didn't approach the bridesmaid, they followed the agreement. However, the action of accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nThe bride might feel that the presence of the person at the wedding, combined with the interaction with the bridesmaid, could be seen as inappropriate. Even if the person didn't start it, they chose to follow through, which might be viewed as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The person might argue that they weren't hitting on anyone, just accepting an invitation, but the perception here matters. The bride is upset, so the person's actions, whether intentional or not, caused her distress.\n\nAnother angle is the fact that the person is close to the groom's family but was still an ex. The bride might feel that the person's presence and subsequent actions undermined the event's significance. The fact that the person didn't reject the invitation could be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes, even if the invitation came from a third party. \n\nConsidering both sides, the person might not have broken the explicit promise they made, but the implicit social contract at a wedding is to act with respect and avoid any behavior that could be considered inappropriate, especially when there's a prior relationship with the ex. The key issue is whether accepting the invitation, despite the bride's request, was a breach of that implicit respect. \n\nIn conclusion, while the person might not have technically broken the promise by initiating contact, their actions could still be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful to the bride's wishes, leading to the conclusion that they might be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the person didn't do anything wrong since they didn't start the interaction. It's a bit of a gray area, but the bride's feelings and the context of the event make the person's actions questionable.\n"
