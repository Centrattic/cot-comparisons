It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding, being told not to hit on women, and then going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author was invited to the ex's wedding. The bride told him not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. But then, later, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel, and he went. The bride is upset now. The author is defending himself by saying he didn't initiate the approach and that the bridesmaid came to him.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key points are: the author was told not to hit on women, but the bridesmaid approached him. So, is he in the wrong for not rejecting her?\n\nWell, the author agreed not to hit on anyone, which implies he should avoid any actions that could be seen as trying to pick up women. If the bridesmaid approached him, maybe it's not the same as him approaching her. However, going to her hotel room could still be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who made the initial request. Even if she invited him, being in a private setting at a wedding might be crossing a line, especially since there's a prior agreement not to flirt or hit on anyone.\n\nAlso, the bride is upset because he went to another woman's hotel room. Even if he didn't initiate the contact, accepting the invitation might still be considered violating the spirit of the promise he made. The bride's request was likely to prevent him from making her uncomfortable or causing any issues at the wedding. By going with the bridesmaid, he might have made the bride feel disrespected or caused unnecessary tension.\n\nAnother angle: the author was at a wedding of his ex. Being close to the groom might mean he's part of the inner circle, so his actions could affect the event's atmosphere. Even if he's single, engaging in romantic or sexual activities at the wedding, especially in a private setting, isn't typical and could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't initiate the contact, his actions led to a situation that the bride found objectionable. The fact that he didn't explicitly violate the rule by hitting on someone doesn't necessarily mean he's in the right. The bride's discomfort is valid, and his choice to go with the bridesmaid, regardless of who approached whom, could be seen as disregarding her feelings and the prior agreement.\n\nTherefore, considering the context and the bride's perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries he agreed to, even if he didn't make the first move. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
