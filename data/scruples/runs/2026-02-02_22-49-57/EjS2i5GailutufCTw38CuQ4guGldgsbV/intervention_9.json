It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, where they were close to the groom and his family. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which the author found odd but agreed to. At the wedding, the author was socializing, and a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, which they accepted. Now the bride is upset, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an ex of the groom, but they were invited to the wedding due to being close to the groom and family. The bride's request not to hit on women is a boundary she set. The author didn't try to approach anyone but was approached by a bridesmaid. The key points are whether the author violated the bride's request and if their actions were inappropriate given the circumstances.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't break their promise because the woman approached them. However, the situation is at a wedding where the ex's spouse (the bride) could be sensitive. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior could be considered unprofessional or disrespectful towards the bride's wishes.\n\nThe bride's anger might stem from feeling that the author is disrespecting the event or her marriage, even if the author is not the groom's current partner. The author's prior relationship with the groom might make their behavior more awkward. The question is whether the author's actions, even if not initiating, were inconsiderate. The answer depends on whether the author should have respected the bride's request regardless of who approached them.\n\nConsidering social norms and the sensitivity of the situation, the author might be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the context of the event. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the boundary set by the bride, even if they were approached. However, if the author didn't intend to hit on anyone but accepted a mutual invitation, some might argue they're not at fault. But the bride's explicit request should be a key factor.\n"
