It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women, which the author found odd but agreed to. At the wedding, the author was having a good time, not actively hitting on anyone. Then a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid did. But the author didn't refuse. The bride is mad, but why? Maybe because the author is an ex of the groom, so maybe there's some tension. The author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because it was the woman who approached him.\n\nBut wait, the initial agreement was not to hit on women. Even if the woman approached him, maybe the author should have respected that boundary. The question is whether accepting the invitation constitutes hitting on someone or violating the agreement. If the bride's rule was to not hit on others, then engaging in a romantic/sexual encounter could be seen as violating that, regardless of who initiated it. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the agreement, even if it was someone else who approached them. Alternatively, if the author didn't pursue it, maybe they're not at fault. But the act of going to the hotel room could imply consent to the activity, which the bride found offensive. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's request, even if it was the woman who invited them. Answer B would mean not in the wrong, but maybe A is correct. Hmm. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't adhere to the bride's request, regardless of who initiated the contact.\n"
