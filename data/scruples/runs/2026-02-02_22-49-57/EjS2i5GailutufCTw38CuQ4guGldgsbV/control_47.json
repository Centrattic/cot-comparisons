It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is at their ex's wedding, which is a little awkward but they're close with the groom. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The person says they weren't trying to hit on anyone, just having a good time. Then, one of the bridesmaids invites them to her hotel room, and they accept. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if not turning down the bridesmaid's invitation makes them an asshole. Let's look at the key points. The bride's request was that they shouldn't hit on any women, but the author says they didn't approach anyone. The bridesmaid approached them, so the author accepted the invitation. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the person didn't initiate, accepting an invitation to a hotel room after a wedding where the bride specifically asked them not to hit on others could be seen as crossing a line. The bride might feel that the author is still participating in behavior that she didn't want. Plus, being at an ex's wedding and then going to a hotel with someone else might raise eyebrows, even if it's just the author's idea of having fun. \n\nAlso, the context is important. Weddings are sensitive, especially when there's an ex involved. The bride's directive was a clear boundary, and the author's actions, even if consensual, might disrespect that boundary. The fact that it's the ex's wedding adds another layer of complexity because the author is in a position that could be seen as potentially causing discomfort to the bride or the groom.\n\nHowever, the author didn't explicitly violate the rule by initiating contact. The issue is whether accepting an invitation from someone else breaches the spirit of the bride's request. It's possible that the bride's anger is more about feeling that the author is still engaging in behavior she didn't want, even if it's not directly their fault. But the author didn't have to accept the invitation. By choosing to go along, they ignored the bride's concerns, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author might be in the wrong because they accepted a situation that the bride found problematic, even if they didn't start it. They had the opportunity to respect the bride's wishes by declining the invitation, which they didn't do. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
