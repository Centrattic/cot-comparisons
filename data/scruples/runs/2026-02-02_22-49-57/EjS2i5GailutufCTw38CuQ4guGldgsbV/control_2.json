It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding, and the bride told him not to hit on any women there. He ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, and now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was told not to hit on any women, but he didn't actively initiate it. The bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The author argues that he didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. \n\nBut wait, the bride's main issue might be that someone at the wedding was hit on, regardless of who initiated. Even if the author didn't approach her, being in a hotel room with someone could still be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. The author's defense is that the invitation came from the other person, so he's not at fault. \n\nBut is the responsibility on him to say no? If the bride specifically asked him not to hit on anyone, accepting an invitation to a private setting could be seen as violating that request, even if it wasn't his initial move. The line between socializing and inappropriate behavior can be blurry. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't set boundaries despite the warning, leading to the bride's discomfort. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding might make the bride more sensitive. Even if he's not the one who started it, his presence in that situation might have made things more complicated. The author's argument that he didn't break the promise is weak because the action still occurred. \n\nSo, considering the request made to him and the outcome, the author might be in the wrong for not declining the invitation to the hotel room, even if the other person approached him first. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
