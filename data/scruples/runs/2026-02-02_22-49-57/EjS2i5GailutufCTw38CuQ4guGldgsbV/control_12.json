It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a wedding where the author's ex got married, and the author was invited. The bride told him not to hit on women at her wedding. The author was at the wedding, not actively trying to pick up anyone, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points are: the bride's direct request not to hit on women, the author's actions, and whether he violated that request. The author claims he didn't approach anyone but accepted an invitation from the bridesmaid. The bride is upset, but the author is confused because he didn't initiate the contact.\n\nThe bride's request might be about maintaining the wedding's appropriateness, especially since he's the ex of the groom. Even if the author didn't approach anyone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior might be frowned upon. The fact that the author was drinking might imply he wasn't in full control, but that's not an excuse for poor judgment.\n\nThe author's argument is that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him, not the other way around. However, the bride's request was likely to prevent any advances, regardless of who initiated them. By accepting the invitation, the author may have disregarded the bride's wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author was just having a good time, the situation is sensitive because of the ex connection. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't honor the bride's request, and his actions could be perceived as inappropriate in that social context, even if he wasn't the one to initiate contact. The key is respecting boundaries set by the bride, especially in a potentially delicate situation involving an ex.\n"
