It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they attended their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the author didn't directly approach someone; the bridesmaid invited them. But wait, the author was told not to hit on anyone. They say they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having fun. But maybe the bride's request was to avoid any flirting or advances. Even if someone approached them, accepting the invitation might still be seen as violating that rule, even if they didn't initiate it.\n\nAlso, the author is their ex's wedding. Maybe there's some lingering sensitivity there. The bride might feel that the author, being close to the groom, should have been more careful to avoid any situations that could make others uncomfortable, especially since they're exes. \n\nBut the author argues they didn't initiate the contact. However, the line between being hospitable and being flirtatious can be blurry. Even if the bridesmaid made the move, accepting might still be seen as crossing the line the bride set. The author might not have broken a specific promise, but they might have violated the spirit of the bride's request. \n\nOn the other hand, the bride's demand that they not hit on anyone seems a bit over the top. But in the context of a wedding, where the host (the bride) is setting the tone, guests might be expected to follow certain social norms. The author's actions could be seen as disregarding those norms, even if they didn't directly approach someone. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't explicitly hit on someone, but they did accept an invitation that led to a private setting. Depending on perspective, that could be seen as violating the bride's wishes. The answer might be A (yes) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if indirectly. Alternatively, B (no) if the action wasn't their initiation. Hmm.\n"
