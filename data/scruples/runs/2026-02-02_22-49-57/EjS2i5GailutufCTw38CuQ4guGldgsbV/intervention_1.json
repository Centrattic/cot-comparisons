It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author went as a guest, and a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they didn't actively hit on anyone but was just having fun. The bridesmaid approached them, so the author accepted the invitation. The author is unsure if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the arguments for both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the bride made a direct request to not hit on women. Even if the author didn't actively hit on anyone, the bridesmaid approached them. The bride might feel that the author, as a guest, should have been more careful to avoid any situation that could be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where boundaries are expected. Also, being at an ex's wedding might make some people uncomfortable, and the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they weren't trying to hit on anyone. The invitation was from the bridesmaid, not the author. The author didn't approach her. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. If the author was just being sociable and the bridesmaid took the initiative, maybe the author isn't at fault. The bride's reaction is based on the situation, but if the author didn't break an explicit rule (since the bridesmaid approached), maybe they are not in the wrong.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. Even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could still be problematic in the context of a wedding. Weddings are events where such behavior can be sensitive. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on anyone, and by accepting the invitation, the author might be seen as enabling that behavior, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might be particularly sensitive about exes interacting with others at the event. The author might not have intended to cause any issue, but the situation could be perceived as disrespectful or inconsiderate towards the bride's wishes, even if the author didn't act directly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, guests are expected to respect the host's and bride's wishes. The bride's request to avoid hitting on women was a direct instruction, so even if the author didn't approach someone, accepting an invitation that could be seen as a setup might be considered a breach of that instruction. The author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the approach was from the bridesmaid, but the promise was to not hit on anyone, not necessarily to avoid all interactions that could be seen as leading to that.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the author didn't directly approach someone, their acceptance of the invitation could be seen as ignoring the bride's wishes, leading to the conclusion that they might be in the wrong. The key is whether the action violates the explicit request, and the context of the wedding where such behavior is sensitive. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
