It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on any women, and the person claims they didn't go out of their way to pick someone up. The bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was clear they were having a good time but not actively hitting on anyone. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, which the author thought was strange but agreed to. However, in this case, the woman approached the author, not the other way around. The author didn't initiate the interaction but accepted the invitation. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's request was to not initiate hitting on others, but the author's actions were in response to someone else's approach. The author didn't violate the promise because they didn't go after any women. The bride's anger might stem from the situation being at her wedding and the fact that it involved a bridesmaid, which could be seen as a breach of trust or etiquette. However, since the author didn't break their promise, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But some might argue that even accepting the invitation could be seen as crossing the line, especially since it was her wedding and the bride was sensitive about it. \n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong based on these factors. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). If the author didn't violate their promise and the invitation came from the woman, then B (not in the wrong) makes sense. But if the context of the wedding and the bride's specific request implies that any interaction beyond mingling was inappropriate, then maybe A. But the author claims they didn't break the promise, so it's a bit of a gray area. However, the key is that the author didn't initiate the contact, so maybe they aren't at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
