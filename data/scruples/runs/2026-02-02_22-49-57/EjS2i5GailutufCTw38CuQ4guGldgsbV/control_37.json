It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, was told not to hit on any women, and then ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is defending themselves by saying the woman approached him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at their ex's wedding, which they're close with the groom and family. The bride told them not to hit on women before the wedding. At the reception, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is angry. The author argues that he didn't initiate the approach, so he didn't break his promise.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's defense is that since the woman approached him, he didn't violate the agreement. However, the bride's perspective is that he should not have accepted the invitation. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a wedding where the ex is married can be tricky. The author was given a direct instruction by the bride to avoid hitting on women, which he agreed to. If he accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid, even if she approached him, it could be seen as going against that instruction. The author might have thought the instruction only applied to him initiating contact, but the bride might see it as avoiding any situation where he's being hit on, regardless of who started it. \n\nAlso, cultural norms often dictate that in such events, especially involving someone's ex, maintaining decorum is important. Accepting a hotel room invite could be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. The bride's anger might come from feeling that her request wasn't respected, even if the author didn't directly approach someone. \n\nHowever, the author's point is valid in that he didn't take the first step. But intentions vs. actions can be subjective. The bride might feel that by accepting, he contributed to the situation. The author might be in the wrong because he went along with it, knowing the bride's request. Even if he didn't start it, participating could still be seen as violating the spirit of her request.\n\nSo, considering the social norms and the bride's perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not declining the invitation, even if he wasn't the one to approach. The answer here might lean towards A (yes), but I need to check for any nuances. Maybe the key is whether the author had a responsibility to decline to avoid causing offense. Since he was told not to hit on women, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as part of hitting on or engaging in behavior that could be problematic. So the answer is A.\n"
