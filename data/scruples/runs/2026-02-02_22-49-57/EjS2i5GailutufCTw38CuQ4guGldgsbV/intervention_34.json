Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. \n\nFirst, they went to their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom. The bride told them before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The person went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nThe bride made a direct request that the author not hit on women. The author says they didn't go looking for someone to hit on, but the bridesmaid approached them. The key point here is whether the author's actions violated the bride's wishes. If the bride wanted to prevent any advances, even if initiated by someone else, maybe the author should have refused the invitation. But the author argues that the bridesmaid invited them, not the other way around. \n\nBut wait, the bride's rule was to not hit on any women. If the author is in a situation where someone approaches them, is that still against the rule? It might depend on the interpretation. If \"hitting on\" means making the first move, then maybe the author didn't break the rule. However, the bride might feel that being in a hotel room with someone else, even if invited, is inappropriate at the wedding. \n\nAlso, considering the social context: being at an ex's wedding and then going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as awkward or insensitive. The bride might feel it's a betrayal of trust, even if there's no romantic history. The author's defense is that they didn't initiate it, but the outcome is still something the bride is upset about. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the rule wasn't explicitly broken, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. The bride's request was to not hit on women, and the author might have thought that if someone else initiates, it's okay. But in reality, the bride might not care who initiated it, just that it happened. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the rule was about not making advances, then maybe not. But if the rule was a broader \"no inappropriate behavior,\" then maybe yes. The author didn't actively seek it out, but they participated. Depending on cultural norms, going to a hotel room with someone at a wedding is often considered a pickup scenario, which the bride might have wanted to prevent. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they didn't break the specific rule the bride set (didn't initiate), but there's a case for them being inconsiderate. However, the question is about being an asshole, which is more about intent and consideration. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I can see that. The bride's anger might be about the situation rather than the specific action. \n\nSo final answer: B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
