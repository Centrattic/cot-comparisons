It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the guy went to his ex's wedding. The ex-bride told him beforehand that he couldn't hit on any women there. He didn't break that promise because a bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around. The author argues he didn't initiate anything, so he's not at fault. \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. At a wedding, especially an ex's, people might have different boundaries. The bride felt upset because he accepted the invitation to the hotel room, even if he didn't approach her. But the author says he wasn't hitting on anyone and the bridesmaid invited him. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation that men shouldn't accept such invitations at ex's weddings? Maybe the bride felt uncomfortable regardless of the initiation. Also, even if he didn't start it, accepting the invite might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut the author claims he wasn't trying to flirt with anyone, just having fun. The bride's reaction might be over the top, but maybe she still feels violated. The key points are the direct instruction from the bride, the fact that the bridesmaid approached him, and whether accepting the invitation was respectful. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he followed the initial instruction by not initiating, and the situation was mutual between him and the bridesmaid. However, some might argue that he should have avoided it entirely regardless of who initiated to respect the bride's feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. But given the details, maybe he's not the asshole here.\n"
