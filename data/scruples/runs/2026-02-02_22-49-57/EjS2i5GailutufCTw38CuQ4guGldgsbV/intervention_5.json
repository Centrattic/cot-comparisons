It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author was told not to hit on any women, but they ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. They argue they didn't approach her; she invited them.\n\nFirst, the bride's direct request stands out. She told him not to hit on women, which he agreed to. Then, even though he claims he wasn't actively trying to pick people up, he ended up accepting an invitation from someone else. The key point here is whether accepting an invitation from someone else violates the initial agreement. If he was approached and accepted, does that still count as \"hitting on\" someone? The author says the girl picked him up, so maybe he didn't initiate, but the bride might still see it as him being available or engaging in behavior that led to that situation. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the wedding\u2014being at an ex's wedding can be awkward. The bride might feel that even if he wasn't the one approaching, his presence and accepting the invitation could be seen as disrespectful or crossing a boundary. The author might not have broken the promise literally, but perhaps the intent was to avoid any such situations. \n\nAnother angle is social norms. Even if the author didn't approach, going to a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. The bride's anger might stem from feeling that he's making a point of not adhering to boundaries, which could be hurtful. \n\nSo, while the author might argue he didn't break the rule by initiating contact, the outcome still upset the bride. The question is whether the promise was about not initiating or about not being involved in any such encounters. If the bride's rule was to avoid all such situations, then accepting an invitation might be a violation. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the author didn't start the interaction, the fact that he accepted the invitation and went to the hotel room could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes, making him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
