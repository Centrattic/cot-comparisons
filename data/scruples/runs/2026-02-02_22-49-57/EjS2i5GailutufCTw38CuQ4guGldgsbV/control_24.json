It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author's ex got married, and the bride had told him not to hit on anyone. The author didn't actively try to pick up women but ended up being invited by a bridesmaid to her hotel room and accepted. Now the bride is angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride made a direct request to the author not to hit on anyone at her wedding. The author claims he didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid initiated the invitation. But he did go to her hotel room, which could be seen as accepting the advances. \n\nEven though the bride didn't tell the author not to accept invitations, her request was likely to prevent any unwanted attention towards other guests. The author's action, even if not initiated by him, might still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. The bride's anger could stem from feeling that the author didn't respect her boundaries, even if he didn't start the interaction. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is at his ex's wedding adds a layer of sensitivity. The bride might be particularly protective of the event's atmosphere. The author's decision to go to the hotel room with a bridesmaid, even if invited, might be perceived as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author argues he wasn't hitting on anyone and didn't initiate. But the key point is whether he upheld the bride's request by not engaging in any behavior that could be seen as hitting on others. Accepting such an invitation could be seen as contradicting that promise. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether the person respected others' boundaries. Even if the author didn't start it, he still participated in an action that could be considered hitting on someone. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's request, even if he felt it wasn't his fault.\n"
