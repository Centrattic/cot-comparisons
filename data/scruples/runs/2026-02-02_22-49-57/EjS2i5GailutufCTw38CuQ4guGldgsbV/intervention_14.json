It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider all angles.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and family. The bride told the author not to hit on women at the wedding. He didn't actively hit on anyone but was just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe author argues that the bride's anger is strange and that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him first. The user thinks he's not wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author promise not to hit on women, and did he break that? The bride said he wasn't allowed to hit on any women, and he didn't do that. However, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might be seen as leading her on or at least not being cautious enough. The bride could feel that the author was being disrespectful to her by allowing that situation, even if he wasn't the one initiating.\n\nBut was the author's action a direct violation of the promise? If the bride's rule was not to hit on women, and he didn't, but accepted an invitation, maybe the line is blurry. Some might say that by going to her room, he's engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, even if he wasn't the one starting it. Others might say he was just responding to a friend's invitation and not at fault.\n\nAlso, the context is an ex's wedding. The author's relationship with the groom could influence the bride's perspective. Maybe she's being overly sensitive, but from her side, allowing someone from the ex to be in that situation might feel like a breach of trust or boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't promise to avoid all interactions, just not to hit on women, then maybe not. But if the bride perceived his actions as crossing a line, even if not explicitly prohibited, he might have been insensitive. It's a judgment call. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because technically he didn't break the promise, but there's a gray area where his actions might have been careless. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just technically correct. If the bride is upset, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings. But he did say he was just having a good time and not trying to pick up anyone. The key is that the woman invited him, so maybe he's not at fault. So I might lean towards B.\n"
