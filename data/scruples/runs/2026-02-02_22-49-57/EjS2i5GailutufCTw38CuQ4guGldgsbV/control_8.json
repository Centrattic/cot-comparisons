It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person going to their ex's wedding, where the bride told them not to hit on any women. The author then ends up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, and the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is at their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and family. The bride specifically told them not to hit on women, so there's an expectation set. The author claims they didn't actively approach the bridesmaid; instead, the bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author agreed. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bride is upset, but the author argues that since the bridesmaid initiated the invitation, they didn't break the promise. \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. At a wedding, especially one where the guest is an ex of the groom, there are unspoken rules about behavior. The bride's request is to not hit on any women, which the author says they didn't do. However, the fact that a bridesmaid approached the author and the author accepted might still be seen as inappropriate, even if the author didn't initially approach. \n\nThe problem might be that the author is in a situation where the bride is sensitive because they are the ex. Even if the author didn't initiate, the act of going to the hotel room could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might not have broken the specific rule given (not to hit on women), but the action could still be perceived as disrespectful to the bride's feelings. \n\nAlso, the author was drinking and mingling, which might have led to a situation where they didn't fully consider the implications of accepting the invitation. The key point is whether the author's actions, even if not directly hitting on someone, contributed to a situation that the bride found offensive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author was aware of the bride's request, they might be expected to avoid any situation that could be seen as hitting on women, even if it's not direct. The fact that they accepted an invitation to a hotel room, regardless of who initiated, might be seen as not respecting the bride's boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take the bride's request seriously enough. Even if the bridesmaid initiated the invite, the author's acceptance could be seen as part of the action that the bride found problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
