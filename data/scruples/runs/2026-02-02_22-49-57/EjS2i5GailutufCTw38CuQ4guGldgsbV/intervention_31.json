It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The situation involves the writer's ex getting married, and the writer being close to the groom's family. \n\nFirst, the bride told the writer not to hit on any women at the wedding. The writer didn't intend to hit on anyone but ended up being invited to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The key points here are: the bride's direct request, the writer's actions, and whether the writer violated that request.\n\nThe writer claims they didn't break the promise because the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not the other way around. The bride is upset, but the writer is confused why. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the writer's actions breached the agreement. The bride asked not to hit on anyone. The writer went to the hotel with a bridesmaid. Even if the invitation was initiated by the bridesmaid, the writer's acceptance could still be seen as hitting on someone, especially since it's a wedding. Also, the context of being at an ex's wedding might add social sensitivity. \n\nHowever, the writer didn't actively approach someone; they accepted an invitation. The bride's anger might stem from the situation itself rather than the writer's direct actions. But the writer did agree to go to the hotel, which could be perceived as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the writer accepted the invitation knowing it could be seen as hitting on someone, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if they truly didn't have the intent, perhaps not. However, social norms might consider accepting such an invitation as inappropriate, especially at a wedding. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes), but there's also a case for B (no). But given the direct request from the bride, the writer's actions might still be seen as violating the agreement, making them in the wrong.\n"
