It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding, was told by the bride not to hit on anyone, but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid and accepted. Now the bride is upset, and he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The groom and the author are close, so the invitation makes sense. The bride told him not to hit on anyone, which he thought was strange but agreed to. At the wedding, he was just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up women. The bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. The bride is now angry, and he's confused because he didn't approach her; she approached him. The main question is whether he's at fault.\n\nHmm. The bride made a direct request, and the author didn't follow through. Even if the bridesmaid initiated the invitation, the author's acceptance could still be seen as going against the bride's wishes. The bride might feel that by accepting, he's disrespecting her boundaries. The argument is that he didn't break a direct promise, but maybe there's an implied understanding when someone is told not to hit on anyone at the event. If he agreed to that, then accepting a romantic invitation from someone else might still be considered part of that. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the wedding, the bride might be particularly sensitive because it's her big day. The fact that the author is the ex of the groom adds another layer. Even if the author wasn't the one who initiated the interaction, by accepting the invitation, he's potentially creating tension, especially with the groom's family and his ex. \n\nThe author might not see it as hitting on, but in the context of a wedding, any romantic or sexual activity could be seen as inappropriate or against the bride's request. The key here is whether the author respected the bride's boundaries. Even if the invitation was from someone else, the author's participation in that situation could be seen as violating the spirit of the request to not hit on anyone. \n\nSo, even if he didn't approach the bridesmaid, by accepting her invitation, he's still engaging in behavior the bride wanted to avoid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's request, leading to her being upset. The answer would be A.\n"
