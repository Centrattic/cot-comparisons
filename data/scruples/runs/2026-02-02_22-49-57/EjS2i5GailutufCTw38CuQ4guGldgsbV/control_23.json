It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author was invited. They had an ex who got married, and the author is close to the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author didn't plan to, but then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The author didn't actively approach someone but accepted an invitation. The key points are: Did the author violate the bride's request? And is the author responsible for the bride's reaction?\n\nThe author didn't go up to women to hit on them, so technically, they didn't initiate. But the fact that they accepted the invitation from the bridesmaid could be seen as going against the bride's wishes. Even if the woman approached the author, the author's decision to go to her hotel room might still be problematic, especially in a wedding setting. Weddings can be sensitive, and people might have different expectations about appropriate behavior.\n\nAlso, the author is at their ex's wedding, which adds another layer. While they might not be in a relationship now, the bride's request could stem from a desire to avoid any potential tension or jealousy. The author's actions, even if passive, might not be in line with that. Accepting such an invitation could be perceived as disrespectful to the bride's feelings, regardless of the circumstances. The bride might feel that the author is undermining her or the wedding's atmosphere.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the wedding. The bride is the one hosting the event, and her guests, including the author, are expected to adhere to certain norms. If the bride specifically asked the author not to hit on women, it's a sign of her discomfort or boundaries. Even if the author didn't approach someone, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might still cross that boundary. The author's defense is that the invitation was from the other person, but the responsibility is still on the author to respect the bride's request.\n\nMoreover, the author's statement that they're not in the wrong because they didn't break the promise points to the technicality. However, the spirit of the request is about the author's behavior at the wedding. If the author is in a position where someone might invite them to a hotel room, even if not initiated by the author, it could still be seen as inappropriate, especially in a wedding context. The author might not have intended to disrespect, but the action could be interpreted that way.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author didn't actively approach someone, accepting the invitation might still be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is a response to her own boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even if the interaction was initiated by the bridesmaid. The answer would be A.\n"
