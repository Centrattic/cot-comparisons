It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where the bride told him not to hit on any women beforehand. He went to the reception, had a good time, and when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he accepted. Now the bride is angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's ex got married, and he was invited because he's close with the groom and his family. The bride directly told him not to hit on women at her wedding. The author claims he didn't actively try to pick anyone up, but when a bridesmaid invited him, he went along. The main arguments from the author are that the bride is overreacting and he didn't break his promise since the woman approached him.\n\nNow, considering common social norms and expectations at weddings. Weddings can be sensitive for exes, even if they're friends. The bride making a direct request to not hit on any women suggests she's concerned about her own comfort and the integrity of her new marriage. The author's defense is that he wasn't approaching others, but when someone approached him, he accepted. However, even if the invitation was initiated by the bridesmaid, accepting could still be seen as crossing a line, especially if it was after the bride's request.\n\nAnother angle: the author was an ex. Even if they were friends, there might be lingering sensitivity. The bride's request was likely to prevent any potential discomfort or jealousy during her wedding. The author's action might not be a direct violation of a rule, but it could be perceived as disregarding the bride's feelings and the context of the event. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author was at the wedding as a guest of the groom and his family might mean he should have been more considerate of the bride's perspective. While the author didn't approach others, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could still be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. The bride might feel that any interaction between the author and another woman in that setting is a breach of her expectations.\n\nThe concept of \"hit on\" is a bit broad. The author argues that he wasn't trying to pick people up, but going to a hotel room with someone could still be interpreted as flirtation or something more. The bride might not be okay with any such interactions, especially given the ex relationship. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the social context and how others might feel are often important. Even if the author didn't break his promise literally, the intention and the sensitivity of the situation matter. The bride's reaction is about feeling disrespected, so the author's action, though perhaps not a direct violation, could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author prioritized the bride's request. The bride asked him not to hit on anyone, and even though the woman approached him, the author's acceptance could still be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary, even if he didn't initiate the contact. The key issue here is respecting the bride's wishes to avoid causing her distress, especially in a setting where such actions could be viewed as undermining her marriage.\n"
