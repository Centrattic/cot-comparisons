It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they didn't actively hit on anyone but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was told not to hit on women, but they didn't do that. However, they accepted an invitation to a hotel room. The question is whether this was wrong. The bride might feel that even if the author didn't initiate, being in a hotel room with someone else could be offensive, especially at their wedding. The author's argument is that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not them, so they didn't break the rule.\n\nBut social norms often consider accepting such an invitation as problematic, regardless of who initiated it. The fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer. Even if the author isn't in a relationship now, the context of the event might make such actions seem inappropriate. The bride might feel that the author's presence there is already a sensitive topic, and engaging with another guest could be seen as disrespectful or causing discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned they were drinking and mingling, which might imply they were more relaxed or open to socializing. The key issue here is whether accepting the invitation, even if not initiated by the author, violates the spirit of the bride's request. The bride might have wanted to avoid any potential for the author to engage in behavior that could be seen as flirtatious or inappropriate, given their past relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't actively hit on anyone, which was the specific instruction. But the invitation to a hotel room is a different scenario. Socially, being in a private setting with someone else at a wedding, especially an ex's wedding, could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if it wasn't initiated by the author. The bride's anger might stem from feeling that the author didn't respect the sensitivity of the situation and the implicit request to not engage in any behavior that could cause discomfort.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong because they disregarded the bride's request by entering a potentially compromising situation, even if they didn't actively solicit it. The bride's feelings are valid in this context, and the author's actions could be seen as insensitively disregarding her boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n"
