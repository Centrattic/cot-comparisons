It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The person attended their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom. The bride had told them not to hit on anyone, but the author claims they weren't trying to. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nSo, the main points here are the agreement the author had with the bride and the actions they took. The bride explicitly told them not to hit on any women, and the author went to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. Even if the author didn't initiate the approach, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the agreement, especially since the bride didn't know about it. The author's defense is that the woman approached them, but the key here is that the author agreed to go to the hotel room. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, and while the author might argue they didn't initiate, the action of going to the hotel room with someone could be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior is generally frowned upon. The author's ex is now upset, and the author might have breached trust or respect, even if they didn't break the exact wording of the agreement. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the bride's wishes and the social expectations of the event.\n"
