It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The situation involves attending their ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women there. The person claims they weren't trying to actively hit on anyone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was invited to the ex's wedding because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author insists they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were just having fun. The bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider different angles. The bride made a direct request that the author not hit on any women. While the author claims they weren't hitting on anyone, the fact that they went to the hotel room with a bridesmaid might still be seen as violating that request. The bride's perspective is important here\u2014she might feel that the author was engaging in behavior they were told not to, even if it was an invitation from someone else. \n\nAlso, the context of an ex's wedding could add sensitivity. Even if the author wasn't in a relationship at the time, attending a wedding where there's a history with the bride might set up expectations of being respectful. The author's argument is that the other person initiated the contact, but the initial instruction from the bride was a clear boundary. \n\nAnother point: the author says they weren't trying to pick up someone, but the action of going to a hotel room with someone else could be seen as crossing a line regardless of intent. The bride's anger might stem from the perception that the author is disregarding her boundaries, even if they didn't directly hit on someone. \n\nHowever, if the author didn't initiate the contact and was just accepting an invitation, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. But the initial request from the bride was about not hitting on any women, which the author might have interpreted as not initiating. However, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as violating the spirit of that request. \n\nSo, considering the bride's specific instruction and the resulting upset, the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to that boundary, even if they didn't actively seek someone out. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
