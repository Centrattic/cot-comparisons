Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author went to their ex's wedding where they're close with the groom and the family. The bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively try to pick people up but was having a good time. Then, one of the bridesmaids invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset. The author argues that they didn't initiate the attention, so they didn't break their promise. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The author didn't go out of their way to pick up women but was socializing. However, when approached by a bridesmaid, they accepted the invitation. The author's defense is that the other person initiated the interaction. \n\nNow, thinking about social norms and expectations at weddings. Weddings are usually events where people are celebrating, and even if the author is not in a relationship with the bride, the request not to hit on people is a boundary set by the bride. The author agreed to the wedding, so they should respect the bride's wishes. Even if the author didn't initiate the attention, by accepting the invitation, they might have contributed to the bride's discomfort. \n\nThe author's argument is that they didn't break the promise because they were approached, not the other way around. But does that matter? If the bride's request was about not engaging in any attempts to hit on people, even if they are approached, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that request. The idea is that the author was supposed to avoid any behavior that could be interpreted as trying to pick up someone else, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, considering the context of an ex's wedding, there might be lingering sensitivities. The author is close with the groom, so their actions might be seen as disrespectful to the bride, even if they weren't in a relationship with her. The key here is whether the author respected the boundaries set by the bride. \n\nAnother angle is the alcohol and socializing. Being in a social setting and engaging in activities like dancing and mingling is normal, but the line is crossed when it leads to more personal interactions like going to a hotel room. The author might have overstepped by following through on the invitation, even if it was mutual. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is accountable for their actions, even if they were approached. The bride's request was a clear boundary, and the author's decision to accept the invitation could be seen as disregarding that. The author's defense about not initiating it might not absolve them of responsibility because the outcome still affected the bride negatively. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundary, even if they were approached. The key is whether the author understood the request to include both initiating and accepting advances. If the bride's request was about not engaging in any behavior that could be seen as hitting on people, then the author's acceptance of the invitation would be a violation. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
