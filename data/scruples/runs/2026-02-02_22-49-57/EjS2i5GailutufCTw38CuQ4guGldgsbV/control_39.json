It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author received a direct warning from the bride not to hit on any women, but then ended up in a situation where a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author was told not to hit on any women, which they thought was strange but agreed to. At the wedding, they were just having a good time, not actively trying to pick people up. However, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel, and the author went there. The bride is angry, and the author is confused about why this matters since they didn't approach the bridesmaid; she approached them.\n\nNow, I need to consider the context. The author was at their ex's wedding, so there's a potential for awkwardness. The bride made a direct request, which the author thought was weird but acknowledged. The author didn't initiate the interaction with the bridesmaid, but by accepting the invitation to her hotel room, they might be seen as violating the implied boundaries of the wedding. Even if they didn't approach her, being in a private setting with another woman at the wedding could be perceived as inappropriate, especially given the bride's request. The fact that the author was close to the groom and his family might add to the bride's discomfort, as it could be seen as a breach of trust or respect for the wedding atmosphere. So, the answer likely leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because they went to the hotel room despite the warning, even if they didn't actively hit on others.\n"
