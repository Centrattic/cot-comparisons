It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where they were told not to hit on any women. At the wedding, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was told by the bride not to hit on anyone, which they agreed to. Then, when approached by the bridesmaid, they accepted the invitation. The author argues that they didn't initiate the interaction, so they didn't break the promise.\n\nFrom a social etiquette standpoint, the bride might feel that the author's presence at the wedding, especially with the ex, could be awkward or uncomfortable. The bride's request to not hit on anyone might be to prevent any potential drama or discomfort for her and other guests. The author didn't explicitly break the rule by not approaching others, but accepting an invitation could be seen as crossing a line, even if they weren't the one who approached. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the interaction, so it's a bit of a gray area. The bride's anger might stem from the perception that the author is still engaging in behavior that could be inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. On the other hand, the author might not have known the invitation would come and couldn't foresee the issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong if they should have anticipated the bride's concerns and avoided the situation regardless of who approached them. Alternatively, if the author followed the given instruction (not initiating) and the problem arose from an unexpected approach, they might not be at fault. \n\nConsidering social norms and the perspective of the bride, who might feel that even accepting an invitation could be seen as inappropriate at her wedding, especially involving someone connected to the ex, it's possible that the author is in the wrong. The key is whether the author should have respected the bride's wishes more broadly, even if the invitation came from someone else. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the bride explicitly set a boundary, and even though the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that boundary. The author might be expected to honor the spirit of the request, not just the letter.\n"
