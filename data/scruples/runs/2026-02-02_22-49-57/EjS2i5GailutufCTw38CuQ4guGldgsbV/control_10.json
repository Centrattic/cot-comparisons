It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was invited to the ex's wedding, and the bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author claims they didn't actively hit on anyone but was just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. Even though they're friends with the groom, the bride has made a direct request not to hit on women. The author didn't explicitly promise not to, but the bride told them, so maybe there was an unspoken agreement. However, the author argues that the bridesmaid invited them, so they didn't initiate.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, the fact that they accepted the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line. Weddings are about the couple, and the bride might feel that even being invited to a room by someone else is inappropriate, especially if that person is an ex's friend. The author's presence and actions might be making the bride uncomfortable, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n\nAlso, the author was drinking and mingling. While socializing is normal, the specific context of a wedding and the prior warning from the bride complicates things. The author might not have intended to break the promise, but accepting an invitation to a hotel room, even if not initiated by them, could be seen as inconsiderate. The key issue here is respecting the bride's boundaries. Even if there's no explicit rule against it, the bride's comfort and the sanctity of the event should be considered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't approach anyone; they were invited. They might not feel they did anything wrong. But the bride's feelings matter here. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and that depends on whether they respected the boundaries set. Even if they didn't break a direct promise, the action could still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the bride's feelings and the sensitivity of the situation.\n"
