It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves attending an ex's wedding, being told not to hit on any women, and then ending up in a hotel room with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author was told by the bride not to hit on women at her wedding. He thought it was a weird demand but agreed. At the wedding, he's just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. The bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author was warned not to hit on women, so he made a promise. If the bridesmaid approached him and invited him, does that mean he's not at fault? Or does accepting the invitation count as initiating contact? The author argues that the girl approached him, so he didn't break his promise. But maybe the mere act of accepting could be seen as violating the agreed-upon boundary, even if it wasn't initiated by him. \n\nAlso, the bride's reaction is about the situation being inappropriate given it's her wedding and the author's ex's event. Social norms might dictate that even if the invitation is from another guest, being in a hotel room with someone else at a wedding could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the bride felt it was disrespectful or could cause issues. \n\nAnother angle: the author was at a wedding where he's close with the groom and family. The bride might feel it's inappropriate for an ex to be there and for there to be any romantic interactions, even if not initiated by him. The author didn't explicitly promise not to accept invitations, just not to hit on women. If the bridesmaid approached him, maybe he's not at fault, but the action still upset the bride, so maybe he should have considered her feelings more.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether accepting the invitation is considered \"hitting on\" women. If the author didn't initiate, but accepted, does that count as breaking the promise? Also, the context of the wedding and the bride's feelings matter. The author might not be in the wrong technically, but socially, he might have been inconsiderate. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" so if he kept his promise by not initiating, then technically he's not wrong. But the bride's perspective is valid too. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but with some nuance.\n"
