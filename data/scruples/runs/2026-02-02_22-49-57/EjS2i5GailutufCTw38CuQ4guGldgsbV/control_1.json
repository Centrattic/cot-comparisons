It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on women at her wedding, and he claims he didn't initiate the contact. The key points here are the context of the wedding, the ex relationship, and the specific actions taken.\n\nFirst, the ex's wedding is a sensitive situation. The author is friends with the groom and his family, so attending was appropriate. However, the bride made a direct request not to hit on women, which he agreed to. But when the bridesmaid approached him, he didn't reject her. \n\nNow, even though the author claims he wasn't trying to hit on anyone, the fact that he accepted the invitation to her hotel room could be seen as crossing a line. The bride might feel that regardless of who initiated the contact, the presence of the ex's partner at the wedding could taint the event's atmosphere. Also, the author's ex is not in the situation here; the issue is with the bride's feelings. \n\nHe argues that he didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. But maybe the promise was to not engage in such behavior at all, regardless of who initiated. The bride might feel that by accepting, he violated that unspoken rule. Socially, being at a wedding and engaging in romantic advances, even if not initiated by him, could be seen as inconsiderate. Plus, the fact that he was at his ex's wedding might make the situation even more awkward. \n\nSo, while he didn't directly break a promise, the social norms and the bride's expectations might place the blame on him. The answer likely leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's request to avoid such interactions, even if the other party approached him. The context of the wedding and the bride's feelings are important here.\n"
