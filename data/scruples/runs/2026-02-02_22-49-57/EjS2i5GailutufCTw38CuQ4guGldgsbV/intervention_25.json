It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a wedding where the author is attending as a guest of the groom's family, even though it's his ex's wedding. The bride told him beforehand not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. However, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is close to the groom and his family, so attending the wedding makes sense. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone, which the author might have taken seriously. But he claims he wasn't actively hitting on anyone; he was just having a good time. The key point is that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not him initiating it. \n\nThe author argues that since the woman approached him, he didn't break the promise. However, the bride might feel that by accepting the invitation, he was still violating her request. The question is whether the author is at fault here. \n\nOn one hand, he did agree not to hit on anyone, and even if the other person initiated, being in a hotel room with an attractive person could be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, if he wasn't actively pursuing others and just accepted a social invitation, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nBut the bride's perspective is important. She might feel that the author's presence or actions made the event uncomfortable for her. The author might not see it as his intention, but the impact on the bride is significant. Also, the fact that it's an ex's wedding could lead to awkwardness, and the author might be seen as not respecting boundaries even if the actions weren't malicious. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the agreement was to avoid any potential situations that could be seen as hitting on others, regardless of who initiated. If the bride's request was to not engage in any flirting or suggestive behavior, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be crossing that line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's wishes, even if he didn't initiate the contact. The answer could lean towards A.\n"
