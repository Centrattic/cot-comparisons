It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, and the bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at their ex's wedding, which might be a sensitive situation. The bride had warned them beforehand not to hit on other women, so there's an expectation there. But the author argues that the bridesmaid initiated the interaction and that they didn't actively pursue it. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: 1) the bride's explicit request not to hit on women, 2) the author's actions in accepting the invitation, and 3) whether the author's behavior was inappropriate given the circumstances.\n\nThe author didn't directly \"hit on\" someone in the traditional sense; instead, they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. However, the context of being at a wedding, especially an ex's wedding, adds complexity. Even if the author wasn't initiating advances, accepting a hotel room invitation could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the bride had warned them. The situation might be sensitive for the bride, and the author's presence and actions could be perceived as disrespectful or causing her embarrassment. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break their word because the other person initiated it. But the problem might be that the author was in a setting where their ex's family is close, and their actions could be seen as causing discomfort. Even if the author is not at fault in a direct sense, social norms might dictate that they should have been more cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially given the bride's prior request. \n\nSo, considering the social context and the bride's explicit warning, even if the author didn't actively pursue someone, accepting the invitation might still be seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but there's a nuance here. However, the common expectation in such scenarios often leans towards avoiding any actions that could upset the bride, regardless of intent. Hence, the answer is likely A.\n"
