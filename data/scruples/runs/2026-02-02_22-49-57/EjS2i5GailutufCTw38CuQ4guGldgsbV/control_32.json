It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author didn't turn down a girl's invitation to her hotel room. \n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and he was invited because he's close with the groom and family. The bride told him not to hit on any women at her wedding. He agreed not to, but when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and the nature of the interaction. The author claims he didn't break his promise because the girl approached him, not the other way around. But the bride's issue is that he didn't reject the advances. The question is whether the author is at fault for accepting the invitation when he was told not to hit on anyone.\n\nEven if the author didn't initiate the flirting, accepting an invitation to a hotel room after being explicitly told not to hit on people could be seen as crossing a line. The setting is a wedding, which is a sensitive event. The author might not have intended to break the agreement, but by going to the hotel room, he could be perceived as not respecting the bride's boundaries. The fact that he was drinking and mingling might add to the context, but it's not an excuse. The bride's perspective matters here; even if it's not a direct violation, her disappointment is valid. So, depending on the interpretation of \"hit on,\" the author might be in the wrong. But the answer is probably A (yes) because he didn't reject the advance, even if he didn't initiate it.\n"
