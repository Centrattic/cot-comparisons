It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told by the bride not to hit on any women at the wedding. However, the author didn't actively hit on anyone but was just having a good time. The bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial request from the bride. She told the author not to hit on women. The author thought it was weird but agreed. So, there was a mutual understanding, even if the author found the demand strange. The key point here is whether the author violated that agreement. The author claims he didn't hit on anyone and that the bridesmaid approached him. But accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, even if initiated by the other person. \n\nThe bride's perspective is important. She might feel that allowing such interactions undermines her authority as the host or could cause discomfort for her guests. The author argues that he didn't go out of his way to approach someone, but by accepting the invitation, he might still be seen as contributing to the situation. \n\nAnother angle is social norms. Even if the author didn't solicit attention, going to a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid at a wedding could be viewed as inappropriate, especially given the presence of the ex and other family members. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, and this action might be seen as a breach of that agreement, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nHowever, the author didn't make the first move. The bridesmaid invited him. If the author didn't push for the invitation and just accepted, it's debatable whether he's at fault. But the fact that the bride made a specific request and the author chose not to adhere to it, even if he felt it was unwarranted, might place some responsibility on him. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, respecting boundaries set by the bride, especially in a sensitive situation like an ex's wedding, is typically expected. Even if the author felt the request was odd, honoring it would prevent misunderstandings. The fact that the author went to the hotel room could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes, which might justify her anger. \n\nThe author's defense that the bridesmaid picked him up rather than the other way around is a valid point, but it's possible that the bride still sees it as the author not upholding his part of the agreement. Social situations often require individuals to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, especially in settings where emotions might be high. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether the author violated the agreed-upon boundaries. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the author's acceptance could be seen as a breach. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong because he didn't fully respect the bride's wishes, leading to the current conflict.\n"
