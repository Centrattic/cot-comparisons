It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, and they went to a bridesmaid's hotel room. \n\nFirst, the user was at their ex's wedding. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on women there. Even if they weren't actively trying to pick up people, the fact that a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room and they accepted could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nEven though the user says they didn't approach the bridesmaid, the situation still happened. The bride might feel violated because her wedding was a place where she expected respect, especially from someone who was in a past relationship with the groom. The user's argument that they didn't break the promise because the girl invited them might not hold weight because the action itself could be seen as disregarding the bride's boundaries.\n\nAlso, considering the close relationship with the groom and his family, their actions might have caused unnecessary tension or hurt feelings. The bride's anger is justified because the user didn't respect her wishes, even if it wasn't a direct approach. So, the user might be in the wrong here.\n"
