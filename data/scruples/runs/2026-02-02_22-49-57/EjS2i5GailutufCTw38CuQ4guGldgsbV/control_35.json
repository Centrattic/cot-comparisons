Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. So the situation is: they went to a wedding where they were close to the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which they found weird but agreed to. At the wedding, while having fun, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the user didn't explicitly hit on anyone, but they were approached by someone else. The key points here are the prior agreement with the bride and the subsequent action. The user argues that they didn't initiate the interaction\u2014they were invited. However, the bride made a direct request not to hit on others, which the user didn't break by being approached. But maybe the issue is that the user didn't avoid the situation entirely. Even if they weren't hitting on people, going to the hotel room with someone else could still be seen as a breach of the social contract the bride set. \n\nThe main question is whether the user is in the wrong. The bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that the user didn't respect her boundaries, even if they weren't the one approaching others. The user might think they followed the rule, but the outcome still upset the bride. So, while the user didn't break the explicit agreement, the implicit expectation might be that they should avoid any situations that could lead to such encounters. Therefore, the answer hinges on whether respecting the spirit of the agreement is necessary, not just the letter. If the user should have known that accepting the invite would upset the bride, even if they didn't break the specific rule, they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the rule was only about initiating contact, then the user wasn't in the wrong. But since the bride is upset, maybe the user should have been more considerate regardless. So, probably answer A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
