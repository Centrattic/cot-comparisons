It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told not to hit on anyone, but then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial conditions. The author was told by the soon-to-be bride not to hit on any women. But the author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up; they were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room. The author accepted, and the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here: did the author violate the bride's request? The bride asked the author not to hit on anyone. The author says they didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid did. So, the author's action was in response to someone else's invitation. The author didn't actively seek to hit on someone, but they accepted an invitation from another person.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bride's issue is that the author went to the hotel room with the bridesmaid. The author might argue that they didn't break the promise because it was the other person who approached them. However, the author could have chosen to decline the invitation, even if it was initiated by the bridesmaid. But was there an explicit instruction not to accept any advances? The bride only told the author not to hit on anyone, not to accept invitations from others.\n\nAnother angle: the author was at the wedding of their ex's spouse. The relationship between the author and the ex might affect the situation. However, the main issue here is the interaction with the bridesmaid. The author's actions might be seen as crossing a line set by the bride, even if the author didn't initiate the contact. The bride might feel that the author's presence in the hotel room with another woman is inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nBut the author didn't promise to avoid all interactions with other women, just not to hit on them. The bridesmaid's invitation could be considered a separate situation. If the author was approached and accepted, it's a bit of a gray area. The bride's request was to not hit on others, which the author didn't do. However, going to a hotel room with someone might be seen as going beyond just being sociable.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, attending a wedding of an ex's spouse and engaging in such behavior could be seen as insensitive or inappropriate, even if the author didn't initiate the contact. The bride might feel that the author's presence in the hotel room with the bridesmaid is a violation of the spirit of her request, even if the letter of the request wasn't broken.\n\nSo, the author didn't explicitly break the promise because they didn't hit on anyone. The action was invited by another person. However, the outcome is that the bride is upset. The author's decision to accept the invitation might be seen as inconsiderate or as not respecting the bride's feelings, even if the action wasn't a direct violation of the given instruction.\n\nTherefore, while the author might not have technically broken their promise, their action could be considered inconsiderate or crossing a line set by the bride. The answer might depend on whether one prioritizes the explicit promise or the implicit expectations of the situation. If the answer is based strictly on the promise not to hit on anyone, the author isn't at fault. However, considering the broader context and potential for causing offense, there's a case to be made they are in the wrong.\n"
