It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex's wedding where the author was told not to hit on any women. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, but the author argues that he didn't initiate the invitation and thus didn't break the promise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, and the author agreed. However, the author claims he didn't actively try to pick up anyone; he was just having a good time. The bridesmaid invited him, not the other way around. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the line between mutual consent and hitting on someone might be a factor here. If the author didn't approach or flirt with the bridesmaid, but she invited him, maybe he isn't violating the initial agreement. But some might argue that accepting such an invitation could still be seen as hitting on someone, especially in the context of a wedding where boundaries are expected. \n\nAnother angle: the bride's perspective. She might feel that the author's presence with another woman in a hotel room was inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. The author didn't intend to break the promise, but the outcome still upset the bride. Maybe the author should have been more cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety, even if he didn't actively pursue someone.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was genuinely just socializing and the invitation came from the bridesmaid, then it's not his fault. The responsibility might lie with the bridesmaid for making the approach. The key is whether the author's actions exceeded the agreed-upon boundaries. Since the bride's rule was to not hit on women, but the author didn't initiate, perhaps he isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut some people might take a stricter view, thinking that being in a hotel room with someone else's friend is inherently crossing a line, especially at an ex's wedding. The context of the event and the sensitivity around exes might play a role here. The author's defense is that it was mutual, but the bride's reaction suggests she didn't see it that way. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might hinge on whether accepting an invitation from someone else counts as breaking the promise. If the author didn't initiate any flirtation or approach, he might not be at fault. However, others might argue that the situation is inherently problematic regardless of who initiated it. The answer could be a bit of both, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since he followed the initial instruction to not actively hit on anyone.\n"
