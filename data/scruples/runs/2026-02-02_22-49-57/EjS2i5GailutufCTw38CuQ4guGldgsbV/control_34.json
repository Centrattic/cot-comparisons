It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on any women beforehand. The user went to the wedding, had a good time, and then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. They went, and now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the user didn't explicitly promise not to talk to anyone, just that they wouldn't \"hit on\" women. They argue they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the key issue here is whether the user's actions went against the bride's wishes, even if not technically breaking a promise. The bride is upset because of the context\u2014her wedding, her ex's family, etc. The user might have crossed a line by accepting the invitation to the hotel room, even if initiated by someone else. The bride's concern isn't just about the user hitting on others but about the appropriateness of the situation in a sensitive setting. So, while the user might not have broken a direct promise, they might be in the wrong for disregarding the bride's boundaries and causing her distress. The answer could be A, but maybe there's nuance.\n"
