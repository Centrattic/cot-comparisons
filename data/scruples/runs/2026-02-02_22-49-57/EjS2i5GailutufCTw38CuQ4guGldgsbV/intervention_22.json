      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that someone (the author) attended their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women. At the wedding, the author was just having a good time, not actively trying to pick anyone up. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't break their promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around. They think they're not in the wrong. The question is whether the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at their ex's wedding, which can be an awkward situation. The bride made a direct request not to hit on any women. Even though the author wasn't actively trying to flirt, they were mingling and having fun. The key point here is the specific instruction from the bride. If the author agreed to that request, then accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might be seen as violating that agreement, even if they didn't initiate the flirting. \n\nHowever, the author argues that since the woman approached them, they didn't break the promise. But maybe the bride's request was more about the author not initiating any attempts to flirt. If the author accepted the invitation, even if it was the woman who initiated, they might still be seen as complicit. The problem is that being in a social setting like a wedding, where people are drinking and mingling, can lead to situations that others might find uncomfortable, especially when there's a prior agreement to avoid it.\n\nAlso, from a social perspective, showing up to an ex's wedding and engaging in romantic advances, even if not initiated by the author, could be considered insensitive. The bride might feel that the author is disrespecting the marriage or causing discomfort to the ex. Even if the author didn't break their word in a technical sense, the perception is important here. The bride is upset, so the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her request and the potential awkwardness it caused.\n\nBut I should also consider if the author actually broke any rules. They didn't hit on any women themselves; they just accepted an invitation. If the bride's rule was explicitly not to engage in any flirtatious behavior, then maybe the author did. However, the exact phrasing of the rule might matter. If it was a mutual agreement to not hit on anyone, then accepting the invitation might be a gray area. But if the bride was particularly sensitive and the author's presence and actions caused her distress, the author might still be wrong, even if they followed the rules technically.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the consensus often hinges on intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to have a good time, not to hurt the bride. But the consequence is that the bride is upset. The bride's request was to prevent such situations, so by accepting the invitation, the author might have ignored her feelings. Even if the woman approached them, the author could have declined the invitation to respect the bride's wishes. \n\nSo, while the author might not be the \"bad guy\" in a strict sense, they might be at fault for not considering the bride's perspective and the impact of their actions on her. The answer could lean towards A because the author didn't respect the bride's request, even if it wasn't direct. However, if the author's actions were in line with their agreement, maybe B. But I think the key here is that the author should have been more mindful of the bride's feelings and the situation's sensitivity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
