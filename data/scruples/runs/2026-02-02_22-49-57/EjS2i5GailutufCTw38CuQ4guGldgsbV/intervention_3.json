It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. But the author didn't actively hit on anyone; they were just mingling. Then, one of the bridesmaids invited the author to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The bride asked the author not to hit on any women. The author didn't agree to that, but the bride made a direct demand. If the author didn't verbally agree, then maybe they aren't breaking a promise. The key here is whether the author had an explicit agreement to avoid hitting on people. The author claims they didn't, as the bride made the demand, but he didn't commit to it. So, if there was no agreement, the author isn't in the wrong for not adhering to it.\n\nNext, the situation where the bridesmaid invited the author. The author didn't approach her; she approached him. The author accepted the invitation. The bride is upset because of this. The main issue is whether the author's actions were inappropriate. The author was at a wedding where they were invited, and they didn't initiate the interaction. However, the context is a wedding of their ex, and they are close to the groom. The bride might feel uncomfortable if someone from the groom's side of the family is in a hotel room with a bridesmaid. Even if the author didn't hit on her, being in a private setting could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the sensitive nature of the event.\n\nBut the author argues they didn't break any promise because the bride's demand wasn't accepted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not rejecting the invitation. Legally, maybe not, but socially? It depends on cultural norms. In some circles, it's expected to avoid any romantic interactions at ex's weddings, especially if requested. However, if the author didn't agree to the request, maybe they aren't obligated. But the fact that the bride is upset and the author is now facing backlash might mean that even without an explicit agreement, the social context matters. The author might be seen as insensitive if the bride felt uncomfortable. However, the author didn't initiate the interaction. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because there was no agreement made, and the author didn't initiate the interaction. The bride's request wasn't a binding agreement. However, the sensitivity of the situation could be a factor. But based on the information given, the author didn't break any explicit rules. So the answer is B.\n"
