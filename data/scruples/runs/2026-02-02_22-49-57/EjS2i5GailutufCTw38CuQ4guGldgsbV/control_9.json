It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author went to their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and family. The bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author says they didn't actively hit on anyone but were just having fun. However, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's request, the author's actions, and whether they violated that request. The author claims they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the bride's instruction was to not hit on any women. Even if the woman made the first move, accepting the invitation could still be seen as not honoring the request. The author might think they didn't initiate, but the bride might feel that they took advantage of the situation regardless. \n\nThe ethical side is about respecting boundaries. Even if the request seems odd, the person made it, so not honoring it could be considered inconsiderate. Plus, being at an ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior might add to the bride's discomfort. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's wishes, even if the woman approached them. The answer might be A (yes), but I need to check if the author's actions technically broke the promise. If the bride said \"don't hit on anyone,\" and the man initiated contact, but here the woman did, maybe the author didn't break it. However, accepting the invitation could still be seen as not following the spirit of the request. So depending on interpretation, maybe the answer is A or B. But the bride's upset, so perhaps the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
