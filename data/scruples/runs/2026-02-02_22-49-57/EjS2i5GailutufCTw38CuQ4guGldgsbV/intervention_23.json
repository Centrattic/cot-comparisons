It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves the author attending a wedding where they were explicitly told not to hit on any women. The bride is now upset because the author ended up in someone's hotel room.\n\nFirst, the key points: the bride told the author not to hit on women. But the author didn't approach anyone; instead, the bridesmaid invited them. So the author didn't actively seek out someone. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, the bride made a clear request, and even though the author didn't approach anyone, they might still be seen as violating that request by accepting the invitation. However, the author argues that the invitation was initiated by the bride's friend, not them. That could matter because the author didn't take the first step. \n\nBut does that absolve them? The bride might still feel hurt because someone from her inner circle (the bridesmaid) was involved. The author's presence at the wedding with their ex's family adds another layer. Even if they didn't approach anyone, being in a close relationship with the groom might make the situation more sensitive. \n\nAlso, the bride's reasoning for being upset isn't clear. Maybe she feels the author is disrespecting her wedding by being with someone else, even if it's not a romantic pursuit. Or perhaps she's uncomfortable with the idea of the author interacting with her friends. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the invitation wasn't their initiative. That's a valid point, but maybe the bride's rule was to avoid any romantic interactions, regardless of who initiated it. If the author knew the rule, accepting the invitation could still be a breach, even if not their fault. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong since they didn't take the first step. But they also didn't avoid the situation entirely. It's a bit of a gray area. The bride's feelings are valid, but the author's actions weren't necessarily malicious. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't actively seek out someone, but there's room for argument either way.\n"
