It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Redditt-style post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author was invited to the wedding because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told him not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. But then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was told not to hit on women, but he claims he didn't initiate; the bridesmaid came to him. The main question is whether accepting the invitation was wrong even if he didn't make the first move.\n\nThe bride's perspective is important. She made a specific request, probably to set boundaries to avoid awkwardness, especially since it's an ex's wedding. Even if the author didn't approach, by accepting the invitation, he might have crossed a line. The bride might feel that the request was to prevent any potential advances, not just from the author to others, but also to prevent others from approaching him. Maybe she wanted to avoid any situations that could make her feel uncomfortable or create tension.\n\nAlso, the author is at an ex's wedding. Even though they're no longer together, there's a history. The bride might be sensitive about how the ex is interacting with others, especially since it's a big day. The fact that the author is close to the groom and his family complicates things. The bride might feel that the author's presence and actions could affect the event's atmosphere or the family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly promise to turn down others, just not to hit on women. If the bridesmaid approached him, maybe he felt it was consensual and not a violation. But the key is the bride's request. If he agreed to that, then by accepting the invitation, he might have gone against her wishes, even if he didn't start it. The intention of the request was likely to avoid any such situations, so the author's actions, even if passive, could be seen as disregarding her boundaries.\n\nSo, while the author might not have acted maliciously, he might still be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's specific request, which was meant to keep the wedding respectful and avoid awkwardness. The bride's feelings are valid here, and the author could have considered her perspective and refused the invitation to honor his word.\n"
