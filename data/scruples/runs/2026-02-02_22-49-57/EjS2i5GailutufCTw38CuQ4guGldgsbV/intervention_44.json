It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding, where the bride told him not to hit on other women. The author went to the wedding, had a good time but didn't actively hit on anyone. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The bride's request was to not hit on any women. The author argues he didn't approach anyone; someone approached him. But the key here is the social context of a wedding. Even if he didn't initiate, being at an ex's wedding and then going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line. The bride's demand might have been to prevent any flirtation to protect her wedding's atmosphere. The author might not have intended to disrespect the bride, but others could perceive his actions as insensitivity. Also, the line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. The fact that he was at his ex's wedding adds another layer of potential awkwardness. The author's reasoning that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him is a bit weak because the initial instruction was to not hit on anyone, which might include accepting advances. So, while the author didn't have ill intentions, his actions might still make the bride uncomfortable, making him the asshole. Answer A.\n"
