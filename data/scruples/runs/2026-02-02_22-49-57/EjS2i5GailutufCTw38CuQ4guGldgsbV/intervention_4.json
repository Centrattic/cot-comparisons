It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at his ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The author attended his ex's wedding, which he was invited to because he's close to the groom and his family. The bride had previously told him not to hit on any women there. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if he's an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations set by the bride and the actions of the author. The bride asked him not to hit on anyone, so there's an unspoken agreement. Even if the author wasn't the one initiating contact, the fact that he went along with the invitation might still be a problem. He might be seen as violating the bride's request, even if he didn't take the first step. \n\nAlso, attending an ex's wedding can be a sensitive situation. There's a social expectation to be respectful and avoid any behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate, especially when the ex is still emotional about the relationship. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of his intentions. \n\nThe author argues he didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. But the promise was to not hit on anyone, not necessarily to reject advances. However, the bride's anger might stem from the fact that he was in a situation that could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding and then going to a hotel room with someone else, even if it's a mutual decision, might be considered disrespectful to the newlyweds. The bride might feel that his presence in that scenario could lead to gossip or that he's not respecting the sanctity of the event.\n\nSo, considering the bride's prior request and the context of the wedding, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring her wishes, even if he wasn't the one who initiated the hotel room invitation. The act of accepting such an invitation could still be seen as violating the unspoken agreement and being disrespectful to the bride and groom.\n"
