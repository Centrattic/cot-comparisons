It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user went to their ex's wedding. The ex's new wife told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The user says they didn't go out of their way to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then one of the bridesmaids invited the user to her hotel room, and the user accepted. Now the bride is angry, and the user is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial request from the bride. She directly told the user not to hit on anyone. Even though the user found it weird, they agreed. So the user is bound by that promise. The user argues that the bridesmaid approached them, so they didn't initiate the contact. But the key point here is whether the user's actions violated the bride's request. The user didn't actively hit on someone, but by accepting the invitation to the hotel room, they might be contributing to a situation that could be seen as inappropriate, especially in the context of an ex's wedding.\n\nThe bride's anger is based on the fact that any interaction that could be perceived as romantic or flirtatious is a problem. Even if the user didn't initiate it, accepting the invitation could still be seen as going against the bride's wishes. The user might think they didn't break the promise because they didn't make the first move, but the bride might still see it as a violation because they engaged in a private, possibly romantic setting with another woman.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around ex-partners attending weddings. Even if the user is close to the groom, there's an expectation of discretion. The user's presence might make the bride uncomfortable, and the situation with the bridesmaid could exacerbate that discomfort. The user might not have intended to cause harm, but their actions did upset the bride, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the user claims they were just having fun and that the girls approached them. There's a difference between making advances and being invited by someone else. If the user didn't ask the bridesmaid to invite them, then technically they didn't initiate the contact. But the question is whether accepting such an invitation is against the spirit of the bride's request. It's possible that the bride wanted to avoid any potential for the user to flirt or be in a compromising position, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user did agree to the bride's request. Even if the user didn't make the first move, by agreeing to go to the hotel room, they might be seen as violating that agreement. The bride could feel that the user didn't respect her boundaries, which is a key element in determining if the user is in the wrong.\n\nAnother point is that the user was at an ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride might have felt that the user's presence alone could lead to awkwardness, and any interaction with others might be seen as undermining her as the new spouse. The user's actions, even if not directly hitting on someone, could be interpreted as disrespectful to the bride's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might not have intended to cause harm and was just following social norms of mingling. But given the specific request from the bride, the user's actions could still be seen as a breach of trust. The key here is whether the user took into account the bride's feelings and respected the boundaries set, even if they didn't act in a way they consider to be hitting on someone.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like the user did cross a line by not adhering to the bride's request. Even if the user didn't initiate the contact, the act of accepting the invitation to a private setting might be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's wishes, leading to her distress.\n"
