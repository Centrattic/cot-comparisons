It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, was told by the bride not to hit on any women there. The author didn't actively try to pick up women, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The key points are: the bride gave a direct warning, the author didn't initiate but accepted an invitation, and the bride is angry. The author argues they didn't break the promise because it was the woman who approached them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the bride's request was to not hit on any women. The term \"hit on\" usually means to make advances or flirt. If the author was just mingling and dancing, that's different. But when someone invites them over, even if it's not initiated by the author, maybe they should have declined to avoid making the bride uncomfortable. \n\nBut then, the author didn't actually go further than that. They just went to the hotel room. The story doesn't say if anything happened beyond that. However, the bride's perspective is that the author is disrespecting her wedding by being in that situation. Even if the author wasn't the one to initiate, the fact that they accepted the invitation could be seen as going against the bride's wishes. \n\nThe author might argue they weren't breaking the promise because they didn't \"hit on\" anyone. But maybe the bride's instruction was to not engage in any romantic or flirtatious behavior, which includes accepting such an invitation. The author's presence at the wedding with their ex's family might make the situation more sensitive. \n\nIt's a gray area. On one hand, the author followed the spirit of not being overtly flirtatious, but the specific action of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid might have crossed a line, especially since the bride made a direct request. The author might not be in the wrong from a strict promise-keeping standpoint, but socially, they could be seen as insensitive to the bride's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's action violated the bride's expectations. The author might not be technically in the wrong, but there's a social expectation to respect the bride's request in such a context. Therefore, the author could be considered an asshole for not declining the invitation, even if they didn't initiate it. But if the invitation was mutual and there's no evidence of misconduct, maybe not. However, the bride's upset reaction suggests the action was inappropriate in her eyes. The answer could be A or B, but leaning towards A because the author didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't initiate.\n"
