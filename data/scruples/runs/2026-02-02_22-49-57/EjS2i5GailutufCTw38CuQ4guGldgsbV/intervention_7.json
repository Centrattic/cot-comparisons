It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author explains that the bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. But the author didn't go to the girl's hotel room on their own; instead, the bridesmaid invited them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is friends with the groom and his family, so attending the wedding is justified. The bride made a direct request not to hit on others, but the author argues that they didn't initiate the interaction. The key points here are whether the author violated an explicit rule and if the action was inappropriate regardless of who invited whom.\n\nThe bride's rule might be about preventing any form of flirting or approaching other attendees. If the author was in a public setting and not being proactive in hitting on anyone, maybe it's less of an issue. However, going to someone's hotel room, even if invited, can be seen as crossing a boundary. It's a private space, and such an action might be perceived as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where people are more emotionally charged and social norms are strict.\n\nEven if the author didn't approach the girl, accepting the invitation to her hotel room could imply consent to a more private and possibly intimate situation. The bride's concern might stem from wanting to maintain her wedding atmosphere and prevent any potential awkwardness. The fact that the author is not in a relationship with the bride anymore doesn't necessarily mean they should ignore her wishes for the event. The author might have failed to respect the bride's boundaries, which could be seen as asshole behavior.\n\nBut the author's defense is that they didn't actively pursue the girl. So it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, following the bride's request is a matter of respect. On the other, if the invitation was unsolicited and the author didn't push for it, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the hotel room part is a significant red flag. It's unlikely that such an invitation is just casual, so the author's decision to go might have made the bride uncomfortable, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nSo maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because entering a hotel room with someone not in their wedding party could be seen as violating the bride's request and the social norms of the event. The author didn't make an effort to avoid the situation even though they were aware of the bride's specific instruction.\n"
