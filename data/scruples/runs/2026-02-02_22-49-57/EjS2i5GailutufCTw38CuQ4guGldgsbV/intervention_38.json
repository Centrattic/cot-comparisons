It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick people up, just having fun. Later, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the main points here are the prior agreement and the actions taken. The bride told the author not to hit on anyone, which the author agreed to. But then, even though they didn't initiate, they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The key question is whether the author broke their promise by not rejecting the invitation.\n\nThe author argues that the girl approached them, not the other way around. However, the promise was not to hit on anyone, not necessarily to avoid all interaction. If the author accepted the invitation, even if it wasn't initiated by them, they might still be violating the bride's expectations. The bride's anger could stem from the perception that the author was engaging in behavior they had promised to avoid, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't explicitly start the interaction. They were in a social setting where dancing and mingling with others is normal. The line between social interaction and hitting on someone can be blurry. However, the bride's specific instruction was to not hit on any women, so the author's acceptance of an invitation to a hotel room might cross that line, even if they didn't approach first.\n\nThe author's responsibility here might be in adhering to the prior agreement. Even if the invitation was unexpected, the author chose to accept it, which could be seen as disregarding the bride's request. The bride's discomfort is valid because she wanted to avoid any such situations for her wedding day. The author might not have intended to break the promise, but their action still led to the bride being upset.\n\nConsidering all this, there's a case to be made that the author was in the wrong for accepting the invitation despite the prior understanding. They might have overstepped, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A, but there are nuances. However, the key point is the prior agreement and the action taken that led to the bride's upset. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
