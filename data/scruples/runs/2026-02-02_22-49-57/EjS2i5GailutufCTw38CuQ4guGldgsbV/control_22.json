It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person attended their ex's wedding, which they were close to the groom and his family. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The person claims they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they agreed. Now the bride is upset, and the person is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations set by the bride and the actions taken by the person. The bride explicitly told them not to hit on any women. The person argues that they didn't approach anyone, but the bridesmaid approached them. However, just because someone approached them doesn't necessarily mean it's okay. The person had been given a direct instruction to avoid hitting on anyone, which they interpreted as a warning. \n\nBut the question is whether the person is in the wrong. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on any women. The person didn't take the initiative but accepted an invitation. However, attending the wedding of an ex's partner, even if they're close to the groom, can be a sensitive situation. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room, even from a bridesmaid, might be seen as crossing a line, especially considering the context of the event and the prior agreement.\n\nEven if the person didn't actively solicit attention, accepting such an invitation could be perceived as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The bride's anger might stem from the fact that it's a wedding, a time when such behavior is frowned upon, and the person is in a position where they might be close to the groom's family. The person might not have intended to break the promise, but the situation could be seen as insensitivity to the bride's feelings and the event's appropriateness.\n\nSo, the person's actions, while not aggressive, might still be considered inconsiderate or a breach of the agreed-upon boundaries. Therefore, the answer would likely be that they are in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
