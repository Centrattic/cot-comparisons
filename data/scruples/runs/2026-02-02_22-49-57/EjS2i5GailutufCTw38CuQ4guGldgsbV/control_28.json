It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding. They were close to the groom and family, so it's understandable they were invited. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which they found weird but agreed to. At the wedding, they were just having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't approach the bridesmaid; she approached them. So they didn't break their promise. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement with the bride and the actions taken. The bride specifically asked the author not to hit on anyone. If the author agreed to that, then they have a responsibility to honor that, even if someone else approaches them. The fact that the bridesmaid invited them might not matter if the author's presence at the wedding was under the condition of not pursuing romantic/dating interactions. \n\nBut wait, the author says they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having fun. The issue is whether accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding violates the initial agreement. Maybe the bride felt that by accepting the invitation, the author was engaging in behavior she prohibited. Even if the author didn't initiate, the result was that they ended up in a situation that could be seen as hitting on someone. \n\nAlso, the context is an ex's wedding. The author might have a history with the bride, and their presence there could be sensitive. The bride's request to avoid hitting on women might stem from wanting to avoid any drama or discomfort, especially since the author is an ex. The author's decision to accept the bridesmaid's invitation could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes, even if unintentionally. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't actively seek out the bridesmaid. It was the other way around. But the initial agreement might have been more about the author's behavior, and accepting an invitation could still be seen as violating that. The line between socializing and \"hitting on\" someone can be blurry. If the author was in a hotel room with someone else, even if it was consensual, it might have caused the bride embarrassment or discomfort, which is why she's upset. \n\nSo considering the agreement made beforehand, the author's responsibility to honor that, and the potential impact on the bride despite their intentions, it's possible the author is in the wrong. They might have breached trust or respect by not upholding the bride's request, even if the action wasn't their initiation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
