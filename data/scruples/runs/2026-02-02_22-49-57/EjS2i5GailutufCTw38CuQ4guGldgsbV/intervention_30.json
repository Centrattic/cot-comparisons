It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario involves the author being told by the bride not to hit on any women, but then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, which he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the promises made. The bride told the author not to hit on any women, and he agreed. But the key point here is whether inviting himself over counts as hitting on her. The author says he didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid asked him. So maybe the author didn't break the agreement since he didn't go out of his way to hit on her. However, accepting an invitation from someone else might still be seen as crossing a line, especially since it's the ex's wedding, which could make the bride uncomfortable regardless of the author's intentions.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms. Even if the author didn't make the first move, being in a position where he accepted an invitation to a hotel room after the reception might be considered inappropriate. The bride might feel that he's taking advantage of the situation, especially since he was her ex and the context is a wedding. Even if he didn't promise not to accept invitations, the initial agreement to not hit on anyone could be interpreted broadly. The bride might see any romantic or sexual interaction as breaking that promise, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he was having a good time drinking and mingling, but the bride's discomfort is valid. Sometimes in social settings, even if you don't see something as crossing a line, others might. The fact that the author was at his ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might be trying to set boundaries to avoid any awkwardness or jealousy, especially given the ex relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly agree to not accept invitations, only to not hit on anyone. If the bridesmaid approached him, maybe he didn't violate the exact terms of the agreement. But in social contexts, people often expect more restraint, especially in such a sensitive event. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. If he went to the hotel room, it's possible the bride could see that as the author being in a compromising situation regardless of who initiated it.\n\nSo, considering all that, there's a mix of perspectives. The author might not have technically broken his promise, but his actions could still be seen as insensitive or crossing a boundary the bride set. Therefore, it's possible he is in the wrong from the bride's point of view, even if he didn't mean to.\n"
