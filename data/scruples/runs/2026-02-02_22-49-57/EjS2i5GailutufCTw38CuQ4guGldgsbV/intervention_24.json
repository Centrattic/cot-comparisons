It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding, was told not to hit on any women, but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and he's defending himself by saying he didn't initiate the approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The bride had explicitly told him not to hit on anyone, which he agreed to. However, he argues that a bridesmaid approached him, so he didn't break the promise. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the bridesmaid approached him, the fact that he accepted the invitation could still be problematic. The bride's request was a boundary, and by going along with the invitation, he might be seen as violating that boundary, regardless of who initiated it. People might argue that he should have refused to respect her wishes, especially considering the setting of a wedding where such actions could cause tension or disrespect towards the bride.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't initiate the contact, some might say he's not entirely at fault. However, context is important. Being at an ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior could be seen as crossing a line, especially since he was close to the groom. The bride's perspective is that he's involved with her partner's family, so his actions might be perceived as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around weddings. Weddings are not typically the place for romantic overtures, even if there's no relationship. The bride's reaction is understandable if she felt her wedding was a sacred or inappropriate setting for such behavior. Even if he didn't start it, participating in the invitation might still be seen as violating the unspoken rules of the event.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was drinking and mingling might contribute to the perception that he was looking to pick someone up, which could explain the bride's anger. She might feel that his presence and behavior were disrespectful to her and the event.\n\nBut the author's defense is that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. This is a classic \"I didn't ask her out\" argument. However, in social contexts, accepting invitations from others when you've been told not to engage in certain behavior can still be seen as complicity. It's about respecting boundaries, even if they were set by someone else.\n\nSo considering all these points, there's a chance that the author is at fault. The bride's request was clear, and even if he didn't initiate, his acceptance could be seen as a breach of that agreement. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong). But I need to be careful not to overcomplicate it. The user's own opinion was that the author isn't wrong, but I need to assess based on typical moral standards here.\n"
