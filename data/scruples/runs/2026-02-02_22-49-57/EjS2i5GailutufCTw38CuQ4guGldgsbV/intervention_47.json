It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author was told by the bride not to hit on any women, but he ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. He argues he didn't initiate it and that the request was odd.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex got married, and the author is close with the groom. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, which he found weird but agreed to. However, he didn't actively seek to hit on anyone. The key point is the hotel room situation with the bridesmaid. The author says he didn't approach her; she invited him. \n\nBut the problem is that even if the invitation was from the bridesmaid, being in a hotel room alone with someone at a wedding, especially an ex's wedding, can be seen as inappropriate. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, which the author took as a promise not to initiate, but the situation with the hotel room might be a violation regardless of who invited whom. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he agreed to go to the hotel room, which could be seen as acting on the invitation, thus hitting on her. Even if he didn't initiate, accepting the invite could still be considered hitting on her. The bride's request was likely to prevent any such interactions, so the author might have broken his promise by being in that situation.\n\nAlso, social norms often expect guests to avoid any behavior that could be perceived as trying to flirt with others at a wedding, especially an ex's. The fact that he was an ex's guest adds another layer of sensitivity. The bride's anger is reasonable because it could cause tension between families or the ex. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't start the interaction, accepting the hotel room invite might still be seen as inconsiderate or violating the bride's request. Therefore, the answer is that he is in the wrong.\n"
