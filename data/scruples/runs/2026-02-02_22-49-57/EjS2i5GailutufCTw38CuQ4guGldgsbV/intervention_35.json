It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the author is at a wedding of their ex. Even though they are close with the groom and his family, the presence there could be a sensitive situation. The bride directly told them not to hit on women, so there's an expectation set. The author says they didn't initiate the approach; instead, the bridesmaid approached them. So technically, they didn't go against the bride's specific request. But maybe there's an unspoken rule or social norm about attending ex's weddings and avoiding certain interactions.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author violate the bride's request? The author claims they didn't go up to anyone, so they didn't hit on anyone. The bridesmaid approached them. However, accepting an invitation to her hotel room might still be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who made the initial move. The bride is upset because of the context\u2014her wedding, her ex's ex's presence. Even if the author didn't actively pursue someone, the situation could be seen as awkward or disrespectful to the bride.\n\nBut the author didn't go against the direct instruction of hitting on others. The bride's anger might be more about the situation than the actual action. It's possible that being at the wedding at all might be a sensitive spot, and interactions like this can cause tension. However, if the author adhered to the rule (not initiating any approaches), then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of social expectations. Even if not explicitly stated, attending a wedding where you have a history with someone might require more discretion.\n\nAnother angle: the author is the ex of the groom, not the bride. The bride's demand was made to prevent the author from hitting on others. By accepting the bridesmaid's invitation, the author might be seen as participating in a situation that could be awkward for the bride, regardless of who approached whom. The author might not be in the wrong technically, but the situation's sensitivity could mean that there's an expectation to avoid certain interactions to not cause discomfort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author didn't violate the specific instruction (didn't hit on anyone themselves), but the outcome caused the bride distress, maybe the author is not the asshole. On the other hand, even if they didn't go against the rule, the action could be seen as crossing a social boundary. The answer might hinge on whether the author's action was within the boundaries set by the bride. Since the author claims they didn't initiate the interaction, the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a possibility that even accepting such an invitation is problematic in this context, making the answer A. Hmm.\n"
