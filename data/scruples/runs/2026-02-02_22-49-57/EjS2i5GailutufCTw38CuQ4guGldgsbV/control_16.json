It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding. The ex is the groom, and they're close with him and his family. The soon-to-be bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't go up to anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The author argues that the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. But the key point is whether the author's actions violated the spirit of the request. If the bride specified that the author shouldn't hit on anyone, even if someone else initiated, the author might still be at fault by accepting the invitation. It's a social situation where respecting the bride's wishes is important, especially in a sensitive context like an ex's wedding. The fact that the author was invited by a bridesmaid doesn't necessarily absolve them of the responsibility to follow the bride's instructions. People might see it as the author seeking attention or engaging in behavior that could be awkward or disrespectful at the wedding. Also, considering the ex relationship, there could be added tension. So, even if the author didn't actively pursue someone, accepting the invitation might still be inappropriate. The bride's anger is valid because the author's presence in the hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as hitting on her, regardless of who initiated it. The answer might be A, but I need to check if the author's action was indeed against the promise they made.\n"
