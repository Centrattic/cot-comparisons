It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where the author's ex got married, and the author attended. The bride told him not to hit on other women at the wedding, but when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel, he accepted, and now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author attended his ex's wedding, which is understandable since he's close with the groom. The bride warned him not to hit on women there. The key point is whether he broke that promise. The author claims he didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid invited him, and he accepted. The bride is upset, but he's confused why since he didn't approach her.\n\nNow, considering social norms and boundaries. Even if the bridesmaid initiated the invitation, accepting it at a wedding where the bride made a specific request could be seen as crossing a line. The bride's discomfort might come from feeling that the author is disrespecting the wedding setting or the relationship dynamics. The author might argue he didn't break the rule, but the perception is important here. \n\nThe author's ex is married now, so maybe the bride wanted to maintain a respectful environment for the wedding. The author's presence there could be sensitive, and his actions might have made the bride uncomfortable. Even if he didn't approach the bridesmaid, going to her hotel room could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially in a context where others might find it inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was drinking and mingling might contribute to the perception of him being there to \"hit on\" women. The bride's rule was to prevent him from hitting on others, and even if he didn't start the interaction, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that spirit. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the author followed the letter of the rule (not initiating), but the action still upset the bride, maybe he's being insensitive. The bride's feelings are valid, and even if he didn't break his word, he might have disregarded her wishes in practice. The answer would lean towards \"Yes,\" he is in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if indirectly."
