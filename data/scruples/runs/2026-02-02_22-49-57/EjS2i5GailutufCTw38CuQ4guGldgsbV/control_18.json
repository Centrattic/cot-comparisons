It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The person attended their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The writer didn't actively try to pick people up, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they agreed. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe main points to consider are the social expectations and the promises made. The bride asked them not to hit on anyone, which they agreed to. But the situation is a bit ambiguous. The writer says they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid invited them. However, by accepting the invitation, they might be seen as engaging in behavior that the bride found unacceptable.\n\nEven if the writer didn't start it, by going to the hotel room with the bridesmaid, they may have violated the spirit of the bride's request. The bride might feel that allowing someone to go to a private setting with another guest is inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. Social norms often expect attendees to be respectful and avoid situations that could be seen as flirtatious or inappropriate, especially in the context of a wedding where emotions can be heightened.\n\nThe writer might argue that they didn't break their promise since the invitation came from the bridesmaid, but the key here is the perception. The bride could still feel that the writer was complicit in the situation. Also, even if they were just having a good time, the context of an ex's wedding adds sensitivity. The writer's close relationship with the groom and family might not excuse actions that upset the bride, especially if it affects the event's atmosphere.\n\nAnother angle is the initial demand from the bride. It's unusual for a bride to make such a request, but if the writer agreed to it, then they have a responsibility to uphold that agreement. The writer's explanation that they weren't trying to pick people up might not matter if their actions still caused discomfort. The fact that they went along with the hotel room invitation could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes, even if they felt it was consensual and not initiated by them.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, attending a wedding with an ex's new spouse and being in a position where your actions could be misinterpreted or cause upset is tricky. The writer might not have intended harm, but the outcome is that the bride is upset. Whether that makes the writer an asshole depends on whether they should have foreseen the bride's possible reaction and avoided the situation altogether, even if the invitation was from someone else.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it seems like the writer is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if indirectly. They could have chosen to decline the invitation to avoid any conflict, especially after being explicitly told not to hit on anyone. The fact that they went along undermines the bride's request and could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
