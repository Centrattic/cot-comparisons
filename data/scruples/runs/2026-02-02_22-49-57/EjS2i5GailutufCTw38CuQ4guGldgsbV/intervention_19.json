It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario involves the author attending a wedding where they were told not to hit on any women beforehand. The key points here are the initial warning from the bride, the author's actions during the wedding, and the subsequent fallout.\n\nFirst, the bride specifically told the author not to hit on any women. The author thought it was weird but agreed. However, when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, the author accepted. The author argues that they didn't initiate the approach, so they didn't break the promise. The bride is upset, but the author is confused because they thought they followed the rules.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author was given a clear boundary and then crossed it by accepting the invitation. Even though the bridesmaid initiated the interaction, the author's decision to go along with it might still be seen as violating the promise. The bride's expectation was that the author would avoid hitting on anyone, which could include not engaging in potentially romantic or intimate situations, regardless of who approached whom. The author's defense that they didn't initiate it might not hold water if the promise was to not hit on anyone, including accepting invitations from others. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to violate the agreement since the bridesmaid approached them. But the issue is about respecting the bride's boundaries. The author's presence at the wedding could already be sensitive due to the ex relationship, so even if it was a mutual friend's wedding, maintaining clear boundaries is important to avoid causing offense. The author's actions, regardless of initiation, might still be seen as disregarding the bride's explicit request, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong.\n"
