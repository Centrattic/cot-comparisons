It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding, where the bride told him not to hit on any women. He ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The main question is whether he's the asshole for not turning her down.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at his ex's wedding. The bride specifically told him not to hit on women. He claims he wasn't actively trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset, and he's confused why since he didn't approach her.\n\nI should consider the context. The bride made a direct request, so the author should have respected that. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the fact that he went along with it could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes. The author argues it wasn't his initiative, but maybe the issue is that he didn't set boundaries. Was he aware that the bride might be upset if he engaged in such behavior, regardless of who initiated it?\n\nAlso, the setting is a wedding, which is a sensitive event. The author is close to the groom and the family, so he might be expected to behave in a way that doesn't cause offense. Even if he didn't break a specific promise (since the bride asked him not to initiate, but he didn't), his actions might still be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAnother angle: the author might not have intended to cause harm, but the bride's perspective is important. She could feel that even if he didn't approach her, being in a hotel room with a bridesmaid could lead to gossip or make her feel uncomfortable. The author's decision to go along with the invitation might not have considered her feelings, even if he didn't directly approach someone.\n\nSo, the key here is respecting boundaries. The bride set a boundary, and even though the author didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation could be seen as violating that boundary. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not respecting her wishes, even if he didn't directly approach someone.\n"
