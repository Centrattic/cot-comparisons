Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the ex got married, and the person was invited because they're close with the groom and family. That makes sense. The bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person agreed to that, but then later, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went along with it. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the initial request from the bride not to hit on anyone. The author argues that the girl approached them, not the other way around. But did they actually break the promise? The bride said not to hit on women, which would involve the author initiating contact. If the bridesmaid initiated the invitation, maybe the author didn't technically break their promise. However, the situation is a wedding, and even if the girl invited them, the author went along. That could be seen as leading her on, especially since the bride had made it clear that such behavior was off-limits to the author.\n\nBut then again, the author says they weren't trying to pick up women, just having a good time. The bride's reaction might be about the perception of the author's presence at the wedding and any potential for misinterpretation. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could still be problematic. The bride might feel that allowing the author to be in that situation was a breach of trust, regardless of who made the move. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's relationship with the ex. Being at the ex's wedding as a guest, even if close with the groom, could be sensitive. The bride's request might be about setting boundaries to avoid any awkwardness or jealousy. The author's actions, even if not directly violating the promise, could still be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes, leading to her being upset. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bride specifically said not to hit on anyone, and the author went to the hotel with a bridesmaid, even if she approached them, it might still be considered a violation of the agreement. The author's defense is that they didn't initiate, but the action itself could be seen as participating in something the bride explicitly asked them not to do. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundary by accepting the invitation, regardless of who made it. On the other hand, if the author didn't actively seek the interaction, maybe it's not their fault. But the intent versus the action is tricky here. The bride's perspective is also important; if she felt it was a problem, there's a reason for her reaction. So, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't honor the boundary set by the bride, even if the invitation was from the bridesmaid.\n"
