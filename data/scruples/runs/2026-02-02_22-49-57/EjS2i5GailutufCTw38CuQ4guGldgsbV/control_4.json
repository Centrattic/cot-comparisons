It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women there. The author claims they didn't go looking for attention but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid, and they accepted.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) The bride's explicit request, 2) The author's actions despite that request, and 3) Whether the author is at fault. \n\nThe bride's request is important because it's a direct boundary. Even if the author didn't initiate the interaction, being in that environment after a breakup could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that they accepted the invitation might be viewed as disregarding the bride's feelings, especially in a setting where tensions could be high. \n\nAnother angle is the social norms around ex-partners attending each other's events. While it's not uncommon, the key here is respecting the current partner's boundaries. The author might argue they didn't \"hit on\" anyone, but being in a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid could still be seen as inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the author's attitude\u2014thinking it was a strange demand and not breaking their promise because the woman approached them\u2014might come off as dismissive. Even if the action wasn't a direct violation (since the woman initiated), the context of the situation and the bride's feelings matter. \n\nSo, considering the respect owed to the bride's wishes and the potential for causing hurt, the author might be in the wrong. The answer could lean towards A, yes, they are in the wrong. But there's a nuance because the author didn't explicitly seek to flirt. However, the social context and the bride's explicit request make it a sensitive situation where boundaries were set. Violating those, even indirectly, could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
