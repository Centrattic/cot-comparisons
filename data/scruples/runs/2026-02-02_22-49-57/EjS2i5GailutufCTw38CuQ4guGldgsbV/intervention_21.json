It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to the wedding, which their ex got married at. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on anyone, but the author didn't actively initiate; a bridesmaid approached them instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was attending a wedding where they were close with the groom and his family, which is a common scenario where someone might be invited despite a past relationship. The bride had made a direct request not to hit on others, but the author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone. The key point here is whether the author violated the bride's request by being in a situation where they were invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The bride is upset, but the author argues that the invitation came from the other person, not them. This is a common debate in social situations\u2014whether accepting an invitation counts as being in the wrong if the person didn't approach the other first. \n\nLooking at social norms, even if someone doesn't initiate contact, being in a private setting with someone else's partner (in this case, the bride's close friend) can be seen as inappropriate, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior might be more sensitive. The author did agree to go to the hotel room, which could be interpreted as crossing a boundary set by the bride. However, the author didn't actively seek this out. \n\nThe bride's request was a clear boundary, and while the author didn't directly hit on others, the situation they ended up in might still be seen as violating that boundary indirectly. The author's argument is that they didn't break the promise because the other person initiated, but the bride might feel the author was complicit by agreeing to go along with it.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, even if not actively initiating, the author's decision to accept the invitation could be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have been more cautious to avoid situations that could be misinterpreted, regardless of who initiated. \n\nHowever, there's also the perspective that the author wasn't at fault for being approached and accepting an invitation, especially if they were not the one to make the first move. The bride's reaction might be considered over the top if the author wasn't actively trying to flirt or hit on anyone. \n\nConsidering these factors, the answer might be B (No), because the author didn't actively break the rule, but some might argue A (Yes) because they still went into a private situation that the bride found offensive. The key is whether the author's actions, even if not initiated by them, still breached the agreed-upon boundaries.\n"
