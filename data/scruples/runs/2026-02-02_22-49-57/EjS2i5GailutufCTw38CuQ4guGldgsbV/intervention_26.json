It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. They provided a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The person attended their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride had warned them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. Later, a bridesmaid asked them to her hotel room, and they agreed. Now the bride is upset, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. They want to know if the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to evaluate the situation. The bride made a direct request, but the author didn't initiate the interaction. The bridesmaid approached them. The author didn't go looking for someone to hit on; they were invited by someone else. However, attending an ex's wedding and then going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be sensitive. Even if the author didn't break the specific promise (since the bride asked to not hit on others), the action might still be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding. The bride's reaction is based on the fact that it happened at her wedding, which might be a sensitive time for her. \n\nBut according to the story, the author wasn't hitting on others and was just having a good time. The bridesmaid's invitation was mutual. However, the author's presence at the wedding could be awkward regardless. The question is about whether not refusing the invitation was wrong. The bride's anger might stem from the perception that the author was taking advantage of the situation. \n\nIn some perspectives, even if the author didn't initiate, being in a position where they might cause discomfort for the ex or the bride could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the author didn't have ill intentions and the action wasn't explicitly against the bride's rules, maybe they aren't at fault. \n\nSo, considering that the author didn't break the specific rule (the bride asked not to hit on others, but the author was approached), and the situation was a wedding where social interactions are expected, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. However, the sensitivity of the situation might mean that the author should have been more cautious. But the story says the author didn't go out of their way to pick up others, so maybe B is the answer.\n"
