It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding. They were close with the groom and the family, so it's understandable why they were invited. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but the author claims they weren't trying to pick up women and were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nNow, the key points here. The bride made a direct request not to hit on any women. The author didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid invited them. The author didn't go out of their way to flirt or approach someone. They were just mingling. The question is whether accepting the invitation was wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel they didn't break any promises because they didn't approach anyone. The bridesmaid came to them. So, the author might argue it's not their fault. However, the bride is upset because someone from her wedding invited the ex of the groom. There's a potential for awkwardness or discomfort, especially at a wedding where the ex was present. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The bride's request was to not hit on anyone. If the author didn't do that, maybe they're not at fault. But maybe the act of accepting an invitation to a hotel room, regardless of who initiated it, could be seen as inappropriate because it's a wedding and the ex is there. The author might have caused the bride discomfort by being in that situation. \n\nAlso, the author was at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. Even if they didn't mean to, the presence of the author could be a problem. But the specific issue here is the interaction with the bridesmaid. If the bridesmaid initiated the invitation, does the author have a responsibility to decline? \n\nThe author claims they were just having fun, not trying to pick up women. But maybe the fact that they accepted the invitation, regardless of who asked, is what's causing the problem. From the bride's point of view, she asked the author not to hit on anyone, and the author did something that led to an inappropriate setting. \n\nSo, there's a bit of ambiguity. If the author didn't initiate it, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they knew about the bride's request and still went to a hotel room with someone else, maybe they are. The line between \"mingle and have a good time\" and \"being inappropriate\" is blurry here. \n\nI think it depends on the context. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't go out of their way to hit on someone, but the fact that they accepted the invitation despite the bride's request could be seen as crossing a line. However, if the invitation was mutual and not forced by the author, perhaps they aren't at fault. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they didn't break the promise, but the situation is delicate. On the other hand, maybe A (in the wrong) because of the potential for causing discomfort, even if unintended.\n"
