It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context and the specific actions taken.\n\nFirst, the author was invited to the wedding, which is understandable since they're close to the groom and his family. The bride had warned the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The bride is upset now, and the author is confused because they felt the invitation came from the bridesmaid, so they didn't actively \"hit on\" her.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether accepting the hotel room invitation constitutes breaking the bride's request. The bride asked the author not to hit on any women, so the author's action here could be seen as violating that agreement, even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid. The author might argue that they didn't initiate the flirting, but the bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that the author was still engaging in behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate, especially in the context of her wedding and the fact that they were an ex. \n\nAdditionally, attending an ex's wedding while being close to the groom and family might be a delicate situation. Even if the author was just having fun, their actions could be misinterpreted or hurt the bride's feelings, especially if there's lingering sensitivity from the past relationship. The author's presence and behavior might be causing discomfort, which is why the bride is upset. \n\nSo, while the author might not have actively pursued the woman, accepting the invitation could be seen as disregarding the bride's boundaries. The fact that the author agreed to go to the hotel room with the bridesmaid might be the main point of contention, regardless of who initiated it. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they went against the bride's wishes and the situation is sensitive.\n"
