It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's ex got married, and they were invited. The author is close to the groom and his family. The bride (soon to be) told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author didn't actively go looking for people to hit on but was just socializing, drinking, dancing. Later, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe author's reasoning: They didn't promise to avoid being hit on, just not to hit on others. The bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. So the author feels they didn't break the agreement.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Let me break it down.\n\nThe bride's request was to not hit on any women. The author agreed to that. But if someone approaches them, does the author have an obligation to say no? The key point is whether the author should have declined the invitation from the bridesmaid. The author argues that since the bridesmaid initiated, it's not their fault. However, the bride might see it as the author still engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate at her wedding, even if someone else initiated. \n\nSocial norms and expectations play a role here. Even if the author didn't initiate, going to a hotel room with someone from the wedding (especially a bridesmaid) might be considered hitting on someone, even if the person approached them. The author might be in a gray area. The bride's perspective is that the author is still being flirtatious or taking advantage of the situation, which could hurt her feelings, especially since it's her wedding day and she's already nervous. \n\nAlso, the author was at their ex's wedding. There might be underlying sensitivities. The author's actions, even if not directly hitting on others, might be seen as insensitive to the bride. The fact that the author is close to the groom and family might make it more confusing for the bride, as she might feel the author is being disrespectful or not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break an explicit promise. But the implicit understanding is that they should avoid any behavior that could be seen as hitting on people. If the author accepted the invitation, even if it was initiated by the bridesmaid, it might still be perceived as the author being open to flirtation, which the bride wanted to avoid. \n\nSo, in the eyes of the bride, the author might be in the wrong for not declining the invitation, even if the invitation was unsolicited. The author's social behavior, while not explicitly against the given rule, could be seen as violating the spirit of it. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author didn't respect the bride's request by accepting the invitation, even if it was initiated by someone else. The author should have considered the bride's feelings and declined to avoid causing her distress.\n"
