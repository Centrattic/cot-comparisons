It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, where the bride told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they didn't break the promise because a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they agreed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the bride asked. She said they weren't allowed to hit on any women. The author argues that since the invitation came from the bridesmaid, they didn't initiate it, so it's not their fault. But the key here is the context of a wedding. Even if the author didn't directly hit on someone, being in a hotel room with another woman after a wedding could still be seen as inappropriate, especially given the bride's explicit request. \n\nThe author was invited by the bridesmaid, but the fact that they went to the hotel room with her is a problem. Weddings are public events, and the bride may have felt that any romantic or flirtatious interactions among guests could be offensive or awkward, especially with someone who has a history with the groom. The author's actions might have made the bride feel uncomfortable or respected the boundaries she set. \n\nAlso, the author is close with the groom and his family, so they might be expected to act in a way that maintains the event's decorum and respects the bride's wishes. Even if the author didn't physically approach someone, accepting an invitation to a private setting (hotel room) could imply a willingness to engage in behavior the bride was against. \n\nSo, while the author didn't explicitly \"hit on\" someone, the outcome of going to the hotel room likely violated the spirit of the bride's request. The bride probably wanted to avoid any romantic encounters, and the author's decision to accept the invitation shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
