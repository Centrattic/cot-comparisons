      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding and a specific interaction that led to conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author went to their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they didn't go there to pick people up, just to have a good time. Then, a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room, which the author accepted. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not turning her down.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for accepting the invitation from the bridesmaid. The author argues that they didn't initiate the contact, so they didn't break the promise made to the bride. The bride's demand that the author not hit on others might be seen as a boundary, but if the author didn't actively seek out someone, perhaps they aren't at fault. However, the fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as them engaging in behavior the bride didn't want, regardless of who initiated it. Also, attending an ex's wedding can be tricky, and the author's actions might be perceived as disrespectful to the bride, even if they weren't the ones to start the interaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they were just having a good time and didn't go there to pick up anyone. The bridesmaid approached them, so maybe the author didn't have malicious intent. But the bride might feel that even accepting the invitation, regardless of who initiated it, violates the boundary she set. The question is whether the author is responsible for not rejecting the invitation, even if someone else approached them. \n\nIt's possible that the bride feels the author overstepped by going to the hotel, which is a separate issue from initiating contact. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't break the specific promise made (about hitting on people), but they might be in the wrong for not respecting the broader boundaries of the situation, even if the interaction was initiated by someone else. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether accepting the invitation from the bridesmaid counts as \"hitting on\" someone or being disrespectful in the context of the wedding. If the author didn't actively pursue someone but accepted an invitation, it's a gray area. However, given the bride's perspective and the potential for the author's actions to cause discomfort or disrespect, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they could have chosen not to go along with the invitation, even if it was someone else's idea. So, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be A or B. But I need to consider the context again. The author says they didn't break the promise because the girl picked them up. If the bride's rule was about not hitting on others, and the author didn't initiate, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the act of going to the hotel room might still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because regardless of who initiated, the author's presence and acceptance contributed to the bride's discomfort. Alternatively, if the author didn't break the specific agreement, then B. Hmm. The key is whether the author's actions crossed a line beyond the explicit promise. Since the author didn't initiate, but accepted the invitation, it's a bit of a toss-up. But in social contexts, even accepting such an invitation might be seen as inappropriate, so the answer could be A. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer depends on intent, and the author's intent was just to have fun and not to hit on others, then maybe B. But the bride is upset, so maybe A.\n"
