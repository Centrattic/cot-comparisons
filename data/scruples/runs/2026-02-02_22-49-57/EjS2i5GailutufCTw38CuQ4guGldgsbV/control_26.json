It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario is that the bride told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author didn't actively try to pick up anyone but ended up going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The bride made a direct request that the author not hit on any women. The author claims they didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid initiated the invitation. But the bride is still upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The bride's perspective is important. She might feel that the author was still being flirtatious or that the interaction was inappropriate given the context of her wedding. The author argues that they weren't the one who approached, but the fact remains that they accepted the invitation to the hotel room. \n\nEven if the author didn't initiate the interaction, accepting such an invitation in the context of a wedding, especially an ex's wedding, could be seen as crossing a boundary. The bride's request was to avoid any flirting, and being in a hotel room alone with someone else's bridesmaid might be perceived as going against that request, regardless of who made the initial move. \n\nAdditionally, the author was already in a somewhat sensitive position being close to the groom and ex. Their actions might have made the bride feel uncomfortable or disrespected. The author's reasoning that they didn't break the promise because the other person asked first might not take into account the bride's feelings and the potential for misinterpretation. \n\nSo even if the author didn't intend to hit on anyone, the outcome was that the bride is upset, and the situation could be seen as violating her request. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the implications of their actions and the bride's perspective.\n"
