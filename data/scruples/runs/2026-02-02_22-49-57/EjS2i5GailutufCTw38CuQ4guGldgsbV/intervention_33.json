It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The question is a classic \"Am I the Asshole?\" type.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person attended their ex's wedding, which they were close to. The bride told them not to hit on any women at her wedding, which they agreed to. However, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but we need to determine if that's the case. Let's consider the situation. The author was told not to hit on any women, which they thought they weren't doing. The bride's demand seems unusual, but it's her wedding. The author didn't approach the bridesmaid; she approached him. So, technically, maybe he didn't violate the promise since he didn't initiate. However, the bride might see it as a breach of her rule regardless of who initiated. There's also the social context of a wedding, where there's an expectation of behavior, especially when attending an ex's event. Even if the author didn't start it, accepting the invitation could be seen as inappropriate, potentially hurting the bride's feelings. The bride might feel disrespected, even if the action was mutual. So, while the author didn't break the explicit rule directly, the implicit social norms might place some blame on him. It's a gray area, but depending on the perspective, the answer could swing either way. However, considering that the author followed the rule unless someone approached him, and he didn't seek out the interaction, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have been more considerate of the bride's feelings regardless. I think the answer depends on whether one prioritizes the explicit agreement versus the social context. Given the scenario, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for interpretation. So, I'll go with B (No).\n"
