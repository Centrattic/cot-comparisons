It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a wedding where the author's ex got married. The author was invited because they are close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women, which the author found weird but agreed to. At the wedding, the author is having a good time, not actively trying to pick up anyone, but then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the key points are. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, and the author agreed. The author claims they didn't break the promise because it was the bridesmaid who approached him. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not turning her down.\n\nThe main issue here might be about respecting the bride's request. Even if the author didn't initiate the approach, accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding could still be seen as going against the agreement. The bride's request was likely to prevent the author from making advances, not just initiating them. So if the author accepted an invitation, even if someone else initiated, he might still be in violation of the promise.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's an ex's wedding might not matter much. The bride had the right to set boundaries for her own event. The author's defense that he didn't actively seek someone out doesn't necessarily absolve him if he accepted the invitation. The perception here is important; the bride might feel that accepting the invitation was a breach of trust, regardless of who made the initial move.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms at weddings. People are expected to behave appropriately and respect the hosts' or bride's wishes. Even if the author was just having fun and not trying to be inappropriate, crossing the line by accepting a hotel room invitation could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the bride's prior warning.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't initiate the advances. The bridesmaid approached him. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the author had agreed not to hit on anyone, and accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that. The line might be blurry here. Did the author have a responsibility to decline the invitation even if it wasn't him who approached?\n\nIn some perspectives, the author might not be in the wrong because he didn't make the first move. However, the agreement was to not hit on women, which could include accepting advances from others. The bride might feel that the author's presence in a hotel room with a bridesmaid is inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the wedding and the close relationship with the groom's family, the author's actions might be seen as causing discomfort to the bride. Even if the author didn't intend to, the outcome is that the bride is upset, which could mean the author is at least partially responsible for not respecting her wishes.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't honor the bride's request, even if the approach came from someone else. The agreement was a promise to not hit on any women, which includes not being in a private setting with someone else. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
