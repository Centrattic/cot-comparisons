It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author attended their ex's wedding. They were close with the groom and his family, so it's understandable they were invited. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women there, which the author found odd but agreed to. Now, at the wedding, the author wasn't actively trying to flirt but was just having a good time. When a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted, and the bride is upset.\n\nThe main points here are the prior agreement and the nature of the interaction. The bride told the author not to hit on women, and the author didn't explicitly break that promise because the bridesmaid approached them. The author argues they didn't initiate the approach. But the bride is upset regardless. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if the author didn't start the interaction, they still went along with it. Weddings are sensitive events, especially involving an ex. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, even if they didn't break a specific rule. The bride's perspective is that it's inappropriate for the author to engage in such behavior at her wedding, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the author's defense that they weren't hitting on others but just having fun might not absolve them. The fact that they accepted the invitation could still be seen as disrespectful to the bride. The question is whether the prior agreement (not to hit on women) was violated. If the author agreed to that, then accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid, even if not initiated by them, might still breach the spirit of that agreement. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding and engaging in behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate, even if not explicitly against the stated rule, might lead others to view the person as inconsiderate. The bride's reaction is valid because it's her special day, and she might feel uncomfortable with someone from her partner's past being present and engaging in such behavior. \n\nSo, while the author might not have broken a direct rule, their actions could still be seen as inconsiderate, especially considering the context of the wedding and the bride's feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
