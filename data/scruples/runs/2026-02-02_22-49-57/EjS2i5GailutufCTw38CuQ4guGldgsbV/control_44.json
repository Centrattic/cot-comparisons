It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's actions and the context. The bride specifically asked the author not to hit on women at the wedding. The author didn't refuse the invitation from the bridesmaid, even though it happened after the wedding. The author argues that the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around, so they didn't break their promise.\n\nBut wait, the problem is whether the author is in the wrong. The bride's main issue is that the author was at their wedding and then had a hotel room interaction with a bridesmaid. Even if the author didn't initiate the approach, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a boundary. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which might include any romantic or sexual encounters, regardless of who approached whom. \n\nAlso, the context is the ex's wedding. The author is close to the groom's family, but that doesn't necessarily give them free rein to socialize in any way they want. The bride might feel that even if the author didn't initiate, being in such a setting with an ex's spouse could be awkward or inappropriate. \n\nAnother angle is the perception. The author claims they weren't hitting on anyone, but accepting a hotel room invite from a bridesmaid right after the wedding could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the bride felt it was a breach of her request. Even if the author didn't break the exact words of the agreement (since the bridesmaid approached them), the action still caused offense. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author should have respected the bride's boundaries more strictly. If the bride asked them not to hit on any women, then perhaps any romantic or sexual activity, even if initiated by someone else, is against their request. The author's argument that they didn't break the promise might be a technicality. \n\nIn AITA situations, the focus is often on social norms and whether the person's actions were considerate of others' feelings. Even if the author didn't technically break their promise, their actions could be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes and causing her distress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries set by the bride, even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid.\n"
