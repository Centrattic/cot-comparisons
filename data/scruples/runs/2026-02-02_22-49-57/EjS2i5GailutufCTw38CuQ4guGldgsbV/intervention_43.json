It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, was told by the bride not to hit on anyone, but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author was invited to the wedding, so their presence isn't inherently problematic. The bride gave a direct instruction not to hit on women, which the author thought was strange but agreed to. However, the author didn't actively seek out someone; instead, a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room. The author accepted.\n\nNow, considering the scenario, the author didn't make the first move. The bridesmaid initiated the interaction. But the problem is that the author was in an ex's wedding, which could be a sensitive situation even if they were friends with the groom. The bride's request to not hit on anyone might be about maintaining respect for the wedding and avoiding any potential awkwardness or offense. Even if the author didn't make the first move, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the bride's request. The line between being friendly and inappropriate might be thin here. \n\nSome might argue that the author didn't break their promise explicitly since they didn't approach anyone. However, the fact that they went to the hotel room with a bridesmaid could still be perceived as crossing a boundary, especially in the context of a wedding. The bride's reaction is understandable if she wants the wedding to be respectful and not associated with any inappropriate behavior. The author might have thought they were just being social, but the circumstances of the wedding and the ex relationship add layers of complexity. \n\nSo, while the author didn't act with malice, their actions might still be considered inconsiderate or disrespectful towards the bride's wishes. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries set by the bride, even if they didn't initiate the interaction.\n"
