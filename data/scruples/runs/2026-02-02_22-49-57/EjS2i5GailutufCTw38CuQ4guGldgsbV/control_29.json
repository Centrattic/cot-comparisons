It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was invited to the wedding, and the bride told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid, which the bride is upset about.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the context of the wedding, the bride's prior request, and the author's actions. The bride specifically asked the author not to hit on any women. Even if the author wasn't intentionally hitting on people, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, especially in that setting. The author argues that the girl initiated the interaction, but the setting is a wedding where the author is in a delicate position with their ex. \n\nThe bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that the author not turning down the invitation could be seen as insensitivity or disrespect towards her, especially considering they are the bride and the author was at her ex's wedding. The author might not have intended to break the promise, but the situation could come off as crossing a boundary. \n\nEven if the author didn't actively seek the interaction, accepting such an invitation in a wedding setting, where the bride had already expressed her discomfort, could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's argument that the girl picked him up might not fully address the bride's feelings of being disrespected or the potential awkwardness in the situation. \n\nConsidering social norms and the context, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if it was a mutual decision between them and the bridesmaid. The main issue is whether the author's actions were considerate of the bride's feelings and the appropriateness of the situation, which might tip the scale towards the author being at fault.\n"
