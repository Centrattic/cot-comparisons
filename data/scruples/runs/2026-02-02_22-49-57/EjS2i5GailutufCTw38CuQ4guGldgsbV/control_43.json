It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author's ex got married, and he was invited because he's close to the groom. The bride told him not to hit on any women before the wedding. At the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author didn't promise not to be approached; he was told not to hit on others. He didn't initiate contact. The bridesmaid approached him. But wait, he was at his ex's wedding. Even if he's single, is there an expectation to avoid certain behavior? Maybe the bride feels it's inappropriate for exes to have romantic encounters, especially with people connected to the wedding. But the author didn't break the specific rule he was given. He was asked out and went along. However, maybe the bride still feels violated or uncomfortable. The key points are whether he violated the agreement and if there's an unspoken social norm. Socially, people might expect not to engage in romantic activities at a wedding, even if not explicitly told. But technically, the author followed the rule as given. However, the situation could be seen as insensitive. The answer might hinge on whether following the explicit rule absolves him, or if there's an implicit expectation he failed to meet. Some might say he's in the wrong because of the context, others might side with him since he followed the instruction. But the bride's anger might be justified if the encounter made her uncomfortable, even if he didn't break the direct rule. Hmm.\n"
