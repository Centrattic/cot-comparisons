It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride (the ex's wife now) told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively hit on anyone but ended up accepting an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was close with the groom, so attending the wedding makes sense. The bride's request was a direct warning, which the author thought was odd but agreed to. The key point is whether the author acted in a way that violated that agreement. The author says that the bridesmaid invited them, not the other way around. So technically, the author didn't approach the bridesmaid; they were approached. But the problem is that accepting such an invitation at a wedding, especially from a relative of the bride, could be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it.\n\nEven if the author didn't break their word in a literal sense, the action might still be considered disrespectful. Weddings are sensitive events, and the bride's request was likely to avoid any appearance of impropriety or to prevent her friends from being put in awkward situations. The author might have believed they were following the rules, but social norms often expect that even if someone approaches you, it's better to decline to avoid any misunderstanding. \n\nAlso, considering that the author was at an ex's wedding, there might be lingering feelings or sensitivities. The bride's anger could stem from feeling that the author disrespected the event or her family. The author's defense is that the invitation was mutual, but the context of a wedding and the prior agreement with the bride might make their actions seem inconsiderate, even if not strictly against the given rules. \n\nSo, while the author didn't technically break their promise, the social expectation is to avoid such situations to prevent any issues. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions, even if not directly violating the rule, caused harm and disrespect to the bride's wishes.\n"
