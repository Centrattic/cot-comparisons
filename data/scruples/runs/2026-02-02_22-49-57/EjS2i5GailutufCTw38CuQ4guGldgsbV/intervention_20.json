It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The ex had told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author says they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid asked them to her hotel room, and the author went. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the author was at a wedding where they were close with the groom. The ex bride had made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The author claims they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid invited them. But even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the author still chose to accept. \n\nThe key points here are about the author's responsibility. Even if the bride made a direct request, maybe the author should consider the context. They were at their ex's wedding, so maybe it's sensitive. Also, the bride is upset because of the situation. But the author argues they didn't break their promise since it was the other person who approached. \n\nHowever, even if the author didn't start it, being at a wedding where they were told not to hit on people, and then accepting an invitation to a hotel room could still be seen as crossing a line. The bride might feel that the author is disrespecting the event or her by engaging in such behavior. The author might not be intentionally trying to upset the bride, but the action could be perceived as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the author believed they were following the bride's request by not initiating, but still ended up in a situation that the bride found offensive, there's a gray area. But considering the context of the ex relationship and the bride's direct request, maybe the author should have been more cautious. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the author's decision to go along with it could be seen as contributing to the problem. Therefore, there's a case to be made that the author might be in the wrong, but it's a bit ambiguous.\n"
