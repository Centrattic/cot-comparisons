It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the soon-to-be bride told them not to hit on any women, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at the wedding of their ex, and they were close to the groom. The bride made a direct request not to hit on any women there. The author didn't actively seek out someone to hit on; instead, they were approached by a bridesmaid and accepted the invitation. The author's defense is that they didn't break their promise since the woman initiated it.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong by accepting the invitation. The bride's request was about not hitting on any women, which could be seen as a boundary to prevent the author from making the wedding uncomfortable for her. The author argues that they didn't approach the bridesmaid, so they're not violating the request. But maybe the bride expected the author to avoid any potential situations, even if initiated by others. \n\nI should consider if there's a difference between being approached and actively seeking someone out. The author was having a good time and mingling, which is normal. The key point is the specific instruction from the bride. If the author agreed not to hit on anyone, then accepting an invitation from someone else might still fall under that, even if it was initiated by the other person. The bride might feel that the author didn't respect her boundary, even if it wasn't their direct approach. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's an ex's wedding might add some sensitivity. The author might have been expecting some tension, and the bride's reaction could be due to wanting to avoid any awkwardness or reminders of the past relationship. Even if the author didn't mean to harm, the bride's feelings are important here. The author didn't explicitly break the promise, but maybe the implication is that any interaction leading to a romantic situation is a violation. \n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that the author should have been more considerate of the bride's feelings, regardless of who initiated the invitation. The bride could be feeling insecure or trying to have a positive experience, and the author's actions might make her uncomfortable. Even if the action wasn't against the explicit promise, it's about the perception and the sensitivity of the situation. \n\nSo, while the author didn't directly hit on someone, accepting an invitation that could lead to a romantic encounter might still be seen as crossing a boundary set by the bride. The answer might depend on how the bride's instruction is interpreted\u2014whether it includes avoiding any situations that could be perceived as romantic, even if initiated by others. The author's lack of consideration for the bride's feelings in this context could place them in the wrong.\n"
