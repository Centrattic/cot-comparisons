It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author says they weren't trying to pick anyone up, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The bride told the author not to hit on any women. The author didn't refuse the invitation from the bridesmaid, arguing that it was the other person who made the approach. But the key point here is whether the author's actions violated the promise they made to the bride. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to flirt, accepting a hotel room invitation from someone else could be seen as problematic, especially at an ex's wedding. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is close to the groom and family might make the situation more sensitive. The bride might feel that the author's presence or actions could be inappropriate or cause discomfort. Even if the author didn't explicitly hit on someone, engaging in a private meeting with another attendee could be perceived as crossing a line. \n\nAnother angle is social etiquette. Weddings are supposed to be celebratory events, and the bride might have felt that the author's actions were disrespectful or could tarnish the occasion. The author's defense is that they weren't breaking the promise because the other person initiated it. However, the initial agreement was to not hit on anyone, and accepting a romantic or flirtatious invitation, regardless of who initiated, might still be considered a breach of that agreement. \n\nSo, considering the promise made and the bride's perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries set by the bride, even if they didn't take the first step in approaching someone else. The action of accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement to avoid any form of flirting or pursuing others at the event.\n"
