It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, which upset the bride.\n\nFirst, the guy was told by the bride not to hit on any women at her wedding. He thought it was strange but agreed. Then, later, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. The bride is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did he break his promise? The bride told him not to hit on women. He didn't initiate; a bridesmaid invited him. However, the context is a wedding where he's close to the groom. Even if he wasn't hitting on her, being in a hotel room with someone else's significant other (the bridesmaid?) might be problematic. Wait, is the bridesmaid married? The wedding was for the bride and groom, so the bridesmaid is probably single unless she's related. Wait, the person is the ex of the groom. Wait, the groom's ex is the person in the story. So the groom is married now, the ex is the person who is now attending the wedding. The ex is close to the groom and his family.\n\nBut the main issue is the interaction with the bridesmaid. The bride is upset, maybe because of jealousy or because she felt the ex was disrespecting her wedding. The author argues that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. However, even if he didn't initiate, being in a hotel room alone with someone could be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding where the author is an ex. The bride might feel that he's causing trouble or disrespecting the wedding. Also, maybe the author should have considered the bride's feelings and the situation. Even if it wasn't a direct violation of the \"no hitting on women\" rule, it's possible that the action still hurt or upset the bride. The author might not be in the wrong in a legalistic sense, but socially, it's a faux pas. So maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because the action caused hurt and the author could have been more considerate. Alternatively, if the rule was only not to hit on others, and he didn't, then maybe B. But considering the context of a wedding, perhaps the action is still inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. So leaning towards A.\n"
