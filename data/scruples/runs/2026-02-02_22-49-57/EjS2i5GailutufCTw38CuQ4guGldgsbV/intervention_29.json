It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the author was invited to the wedding because they're close to the groom and his family. That's a key point. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which the author found strange but agreed to. At the wedding, they were just having fun, dancing, and mingling. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, which they accepted. The bride is upset now, but the author argues that the invitation came from the girl, not them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key factors. The author didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did. They were there as a guest of the groom's family, not the bride's. The bride's demand that they not hit on anyone might have been her own way of handling the situation, but the author didn't break their promise because there was no direct approach from them. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the girl approached them, the author could have turned her down. But the author says they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. The fact that the invitation came from the girl complicates things. Also, the author's ex is married now, so the relationship is over, and attending the wedding as a guest of the groom's side is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the bride's perspective is that she wanted to avoid any potential awkwardness or jealousy, especially since the author is an ex. Even if the author didn't break the promise, the bride might feel disrespected or that the author is being flippant. But the author's actions were technically within the bounds of what they agreed to and not initiated by them.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the bride's request as best as they could, and the situation was initiated by the bridesmaid. The blame might lie more with the bride for setting an unrealistic expectation given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
