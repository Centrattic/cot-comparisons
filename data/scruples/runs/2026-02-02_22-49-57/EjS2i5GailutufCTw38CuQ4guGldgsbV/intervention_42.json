Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and the author is close with the groom and the family, so attending wasn't a big deal. The bride had explicitly told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's prior request, the author's actions, and the perception of those actions. The author says they didn't approach the bridesmaid, but the bridesmaid approached them. The author didn't directly hit on someone, but they did accept the invitation. The question is whether accepting the invitation violates the bride's request. The bride's request was to not hit on any women, so maybe the author didn't hit on someone, but accepting the invitation could still be seen as inappropriate in the context of the wedding. Even if the author didn't initiate the interaction, being in a private setting with another woman from the wedding might be seen as crossing a line. The bride's upset is about the social norms and possibly the expectation that the author would respect her boundaries, even if the request was direct. The author might argue that they followed the rule by not initiating, but the situation could still be offensive. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering the bride's explicit request and the potential for the author's actions to cause her distress, the author might be in the wrong. But if the author truly didn't hit on anyone and was just accepting an invitation from someone else, maybe not. It's tricky. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because even though they didn't initiate, they didn't respect the spirit of the bride's request, which was likely to avoid any romantic interactions at all. So, Answer A.\n"
