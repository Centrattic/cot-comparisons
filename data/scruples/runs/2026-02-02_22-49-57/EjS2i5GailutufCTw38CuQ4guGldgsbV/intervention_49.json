It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author claims they didn't actively try to pick up anyone but were having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author went along. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author was at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride gave a direct instruction not to hit on any women, which the author found odd but agreed to. However, the author didn't actively pursue anyone but ended up being invited by a bridesmaid. The author argues that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not them. The bride is angry, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author violated the bride's request by accepting the invitation. The author didn't initiate the approach, but by accepting the invitation, they might still be seen as hitting on someone. The bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation still went against her wishes.\n\nAlso, the context of attending an ex's wedding adds complexity. The author mentions being close to the groom and his family, so they had a reason to be there. However, the presence of an ex at such an event can create potential awkwardness or expectations of restraint. The author might have thought their behavior was appropriate since they weren't actively \"hitting on\" anyone, but the situation could still be perceived as crossing a line from the bride's viewpoint.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around weddings. Even if the author isn't in a relationship, being at an ex's wedding and engaging in certain behaviors might be considered inconsiderate. The bride's request, while perhaps unusual, was made to avoid discomfort, and the author's acceptance of the invitation might still breach that unspoken agreement.\n\nHowever, the author didn't explicitly ask to go to the hotel. They were invited by the bridesmaid. So one could argue that the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. But the author could have turned down the invitation to respect the bride's wishes. By accepting, they might have disregarded the bride's concerns, even if they weren't the one to initiate the contact.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, there's a line between being sociable and being inappropriate. The author might not have intended to hit on anyone, but the outcome was that they spent time alone with a bridesmaid after the wedding, which could be seen as violating the bride's request. The key is whether the author's actions, even if passive in initiation, still contributed to the issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they accepted the invitation despite the bride's explicit request not to hit on anyone. Even if they didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could still be seen as not respecting the bride's boundaries. The answer might be A (in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the author didn't initiate the contact. However, the intent and the outcome matter here. The bride's perspective is valid, and the author's choice to accept the invitation could be seen as disregarding her feelings, making the author at least partially in the wrong.\n"
