It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone but ended up being invited by a bridesmaid to her hotel room and accepted. The bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's actions versus the bride's expectations. The bride made a direct request that the author shouldn't hit on any women. The author argues that they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid approached them. But the problem is whether accepting an invitation from someone else counts as violating the bride's rule. The author might think they didn't break the promise, but the bride's perspective is that the author was approached by someone else and still went along.\n\nThe author's defense is that they weren't the one making the approach, but the situation still led to them being in a private setting with another woman. Even if the author didn't start the interaction, the action of accepting the invitation could be seen as participating in behavior the bride wanted to avoid. The bride might feel that the author is still contributing to an environment where such situations can occur, especially at a wedding where they might want to avoid anything that could be uncomfortable for the ex or the bride.\n\nAlso, considering the context of being at an ex's wedding, the author's presence and interactions could be sensitive. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, which the author took to mean not initiating. However, the line between initiating and reciprocating might be blurry here. If the author wasn't supposed to look for someone, but went along when someone approached them, does that still count as violating the agreement? It's possible that the bride's intention was to prevent any kind of flirtation or romantic interest from the author, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms and expectations. Even if the author didn't start the interaction, going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate in the context of the wedding, especially given the ex's marriage. The bride might feel it's a breach of trust or could upset the ex. The author's presence and actions might be causing discomfort to the bride or the ex, which is why the bride is upset.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not have explicitly broken the rule if they didn't approach someone, but the outcome is still something the bride found objectionable. The key is whether the author's actions, even if not initiating, still contributed to a situation the bride wanted to avoid. The author might not be directly in the wrong if they followed the rule as they understood it, but the bride's perspective is valid. The answer might depend on how strict the agreement was. If the rule was to not engage in any flirtatious behavior regardless of who initiated, then the author did violate it. If the rule was only to not initiate, then maybe not. However, the common understanding might be that avoiding both initiating and participating in such interactions is necessary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their actions led to a situation the bride found unacceptable, even if they didn't start it. So the answer could be A.\n"
