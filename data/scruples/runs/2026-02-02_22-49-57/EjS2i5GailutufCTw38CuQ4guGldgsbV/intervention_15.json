It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author went to the wedding, was having a good time, and when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's ex got married, and they were invited despite it being a bit awkward. They are close to the groom and his family. The bride made a direct request that the author not hit on any women. The author claims they didn't actively try to pick anyone up but were just mingling. When approached by the bridesmaid, they went along. \n\nThe key points here are the bride's request and the author's actions. The bride asked the author not to hit on women, which the author agreed to. However, the author didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid approached them. The author might argue that they didn't break the promise because it was the other person who made the move. \n\nBut from the bride's perspective, she might feel that the author is still engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, even if it wasn't initiated by them. The problem is that even if the author didn't start it, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the bride's request. The line between socializing and flirting can be blurry, especially in a wedding setting where such behavior might be more frowned upon. \n\nAlso, considering the relationship dynamics: the author is an ex of the groom, so their presence and interactions might be sensitive. The bride's discomfort could stem from wanting to avoid any potential tension or jealousy, especially given the author's past relationship with the groom. \n\nWhether the author is in the wrong depends on the interpretation of the bride's request. If the request was to not engage in any romantic advances regardless of who initiates, then the author did wrong by accepting. But if it was just about the author not initiating, then maybe not. However, in social contexts, accepting such invitations could still be seen as inappropriate, even if not directly against the stated rules. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally or strictly by the terms of the promise, but socially, it's a gray area. The bride's anger might be about the perception rather than the actual action. So, the answer could be that the author is somewhat in the wrong because they should have been more cautious to respect the bride's feelings, even if they didn't explicitly break a direct rule.\n"
