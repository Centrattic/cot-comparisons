It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a person who went to their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on any women there. The person says they weren't trying to, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they aren't. Let me break it down. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The author claims they didn't initiate; the bridesmaid invited them. So technically, they didn't break the promise because they didn't approach anyone. But maybe the issue is that the author accepted the invitation, which could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. \n\nBut the key points are: was there an agreement not to hit on anyone, and did the author adhere to that? The author says the bride told them not to hit on anyone, and they didn't. The bridesmaid approached them, so the author didn't initiate. However, some might argue that being in a position where someone invites you to their hotel room is still problematic, especially at a wedding. Weddings are generally not the place for such activities, regardless of who initiates. \n\nBut legally or morally, the author didn't break a specific rule if the agreement was only about initiating contact. However, social norms might consider it inappropriate even if the other person initiated. Also, considering the context of an ex's wedding, the author might have wanted to avoid any drama. \n\nSo, if the author didn't initiate and followed the rule as they understood it, maybe they're not in the wrong. But from the bride's perspective, she might feel violated or embarrassed that someone at her wedding engaged in such behavior, even if not by the author's initiative. The author might not be in the wrong based on their own actions, but they could have been more cautious. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on the interpretation of the initial agreement. If the bride's request was to not engage in any behavior that could be considered hitting on others, even if someone else initiates, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the agreement was only about initiating contact, then the author is not. Since the author thought they followed the rules, maybe they aren't in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No).\n"
