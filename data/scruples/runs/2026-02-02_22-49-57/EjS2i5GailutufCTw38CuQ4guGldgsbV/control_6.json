It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was invited to their ex's wedding, and the bride told them not to hit on any women there. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride made a direct demand not to hit on any women. The author claims they didn't actively hit on anyone but were approached by the bridesmaid. The author argues they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and boundaries. The bride set a boundary, possibly to avoid making her wedding uncomfortable, especially since the author was an ex. Even if the author didn't initiate the interaction, the fact that they accepted the invitation to the hotel room could be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement. The author might be missing the point that the bride wanted to avoid any appearance of impropriety or conflict, especially in a sensitive situation like a wedding involving an ex.\n\nAlso, the author's behavior, even if not overtly aggressive, might be perceived as insensitively disregarding the bride's feelings. The author's reasoning that \"she picked me up not the other way around\" might not fully account for the bride's perspective. In such a high-emotion event, the author's actions could be seen as thoughtless, especially if the bride felt it was inappropriate. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's request, even if they didn't cross a specific line. The answer is likely A.\n"
