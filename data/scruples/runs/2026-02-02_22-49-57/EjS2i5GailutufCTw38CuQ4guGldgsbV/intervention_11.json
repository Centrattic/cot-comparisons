It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex got married, and the soon-to-be bride told him not to hit on women at the wedding. The author didn't actively hit on anyone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is defending himself by saying he didn't initiate the contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the bride's direct request and the author's actions. The bride asked the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. However, he accepted an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid. Even though he didn't approach her, he agreed to go there. \n\nNow, the bride is upset. The author's defense is that the girl approached him, so he didn't break the promise. But the bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, which could be interpreted as not initiating any romantic advances. However, accepting a hotel room invite from someone else might still be problematic because it could be seen as participating in or encouraging such behavior, even if not the instigator. \n\nAlso, considering the dynamics of the event. The bride is the host, and guests are expected to respect her wishes, especially when explicitly stated. Even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, by accepting her invitation, he might be violating the spirit of the request. The bride's perspective is that people should respect her wedding environment, so any romantic activity there might be offensive to her.\n\nAnother angle is the author's relationship with the groom. He's close to the groom and his family, so maybe he should have been more cautious to avoid causing any conflict. His actions could strain his relationship with the groom and the family if the bride's feelings are not taken into account.\n\nBut then, the author might argue that he didn't actively solicit attention and that the invitation was unsolicited. However, in social settings, especially weddings, guests are expected to avoid any behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. The bride's request might be a way to ensure her wedding is a respectful and comfortable event for everyone.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the consensus hinges on respecting others' boundaries and considering how one's actions might affect others. Even if the author didn't break the explicit promise, his actions could still be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the implied expectations of the event. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even if he didn't initiate the contact.\n"
