It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The person went to their ex's wedding, which they're close with the groom. The bride had told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the promise made by the bride and the actions of the person. The bride specifically told the person not to hit on women, which he agreed to. But then, when a bridesmaid approached him, he didn't reject her and went to her hotel room. The person argues that the bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around, so he didn't break his promise. However, the bride feels he did something wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. The main issue is the interpretation of the promise. The bride said he shouldn't hit on women, which would include situations where he's approached, right? Because even if he's not the one initiating, if he accepts an invitation from a bridesmaid, he's still participating in socializing that could be seen as inappropriate given the context of the wedding. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's an ex's wedding might add another layer. Even if he's not in a relationship now, being there as a guest and then accepting a hotel room invite from someone else might be seen as crossing a line, especially considering the bride's request. The person might argue that the invite was initiated by the bridesmaid, but the responsibility could be on him to decline to avoid causing offense. \n\nIn social contexts, sometimes respecting someone else's boundaries is important, even if you think the request is unreasonable. The bride felt it was necessary to make that demand, so the person might be expected to honor it to prevent her from being upset. The person's defense that they weren't actively picking people up isn't enough if the situation still leads to something that could be seen as violating the agreement. \n\nSo, even though the person didn't take the first step, accepting the invitation could still be seen as a breach of the promise. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't uphold the agreement, leading to the bride's anger. The answer would be A.\n"
