TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was in a relationship with a guy. He said they should just be friends, which the author took as a breakup. The author then started dating other people on Tinder to boost self-esteem, thinking they weren't in a relationship anymore. But turns out the guy's \"breakup\" was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. When someone says they want to be friends after a breakup, typically that's seen as the end of the romantic relationship. The author wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others would be their right. However, the twist here is that the guy's breakup was a test. But in most cases, a breakup isn't a test unless both parties agree to some kind of trial period. The author had no way of knowing it was a test. So from her perspective, she was single and moving on. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the guy never clearly communicated that he wasn't actually breaking up. If he said he wanted to be friends but still considered them a couple, that's confusing. The author acted on the assumption that they were over. However, the guy's friend later clarified it was a test, which implies he never intended to end the relationship. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. If the guy didn't make it clear that the breakup was a test, then the author didn't have the consent to know the status of their relationship. But once a relationship is broken off, unless there's an agreement to revisit it, each person is free to date others. The guy's actions here are a bit manipulative because he used a breakup as a test without being honest. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information given to her. The guy should have been honest about his intentions. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
