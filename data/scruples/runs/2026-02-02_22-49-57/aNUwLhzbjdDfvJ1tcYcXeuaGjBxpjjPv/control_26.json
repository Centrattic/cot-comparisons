TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends. The guy broke up with her, she then started dating others, and he was actually testing her to see if she'd stay faithful. Now he's angry because she slept with others even though he claimed it was a breakup.\n\nFirst, the guy said it was a breakup and they should be friends. The author believed him, which is understandable. If someone breaks up with you, you have the right to move on. She used Tinder to meet new people, which is a common way to seek attention after a breakup. She thought she had no obligations since they weren't together anymore. \n\nBut then the twist is that his breakup was a test. He was checking if she'd stay faithful. That's pretty manipulative. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, he shouldn't have initiated a breakup. The problem here is his dishonesty. He led her to believe it was a real breakup, so she acted accordingly. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she made a decision based on the information she had. She didn't know it was a test. Even if it were a test, it's not her responsibility to comply with his emotional games. She was trying to heal and move on. The guy's actions are more questionable because he manipulated the situation. So, the answer should be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
