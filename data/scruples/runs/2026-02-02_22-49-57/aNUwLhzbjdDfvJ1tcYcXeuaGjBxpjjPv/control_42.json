TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, which is a classic example of on-again, off-again relationships where boundaries get confusing.\n\nFirst, the guy claims to have broken up with the author, stating they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts using Tinder and sleeps with others to boost her self-esteem. She believed the relationship was over. However, later she finds out that the guy's breakup was a test to see how she'd handle it. He was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. Now he's furious because she dated others after the breakup.\n\nThe key here is the communication and understanding of the relationship status. The author thought it was a genuine breakup and acted accordingly. If a breakup is mutual and clear, then moving on isn't wrong. However, since the guy later revealed it was a test, there's a deception element. The author didn't know the truth at the time, so her actions were based on the belief that the relationship had ended.\n\nIn terms of infidelity, it's typically considered wrong when there's an active, mutual relationship. But here, the author believed the relationship was over, so she didn't see it as cheating. The guy's actions were deceptive; he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. The author's actions were a response to his breakup, which he later contradicted.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author acted on the information she had. The guy didn't clearly communicate his intentions and used a breakup as a test. The problem lies in his dishonesty and setting up an ambiguous situation. The author isn't at fault for moving on after a breakup, especially if the other person didn't make their intentions clear. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
