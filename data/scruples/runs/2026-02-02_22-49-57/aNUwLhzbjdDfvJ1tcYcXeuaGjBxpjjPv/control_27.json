TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a guy who didn't reciprocate their feelings as strongly. He broke up with her, saying he wanted to be just friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others, thinking it was okay since they were no longer a couple. Then, she accidentally told him about these encounters, and he blocked her. It turns out his breakup was a test to see her reaction, and now he's angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. When someone ends a relationship, especially with the intention of being friends, it's a clear boundary. The author thought the relationship was over, so she moved on. Her actions were based on the information she had at the time. The guy, however, had ulterior motives and didn't communicate his true feelings. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, once a breakup is communicated, even if one party had hidden intentions, the other person isn't obligated to stay faithful. The author had a right to grieve and seek emotional support, including dating again. The man's anger seems misplaced because he didn't clearly state his intentions. The onus is on the person initiating the breakup to be clear, and if they had hidden plans, that's their responsibility.\n\nAlso, the situation resembles the Ross and Rachel scenario where one person uses a breakup as a test, which is generally seen as manipulative. In such cases, the person who moves on isn't at fault. The author acted based on the information provided, so she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
