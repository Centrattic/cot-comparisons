TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author thought they were broken up, so they started seeing other people. The guy later says the breakup was a test and he's upset she slept with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was in a relationship where she was in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate as strongly. He ended things, saying they should just be friends. She, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others. She felt it was okay since they weren't dating anymore. Then, when she mentioned this, he blocked her, revealing the breakup was a test.\n\nThe main question is: Was she wrong to sleep with others after a breakup? Well, if they were officially broken up, she's not cheating. Cheating would be during an active relationship. But here, the guy later claims the breakup was a test. That's a bit deceptive. However, the author acted based on the information she had at the time.\n\nSome might say she's in the wrong because she moved on quickly, but she thought it was a real breakup. Others might argue the guy was manipulative for testing her. The author's intentions were to rebuild her self-esteem after a breakup. Her actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over.\n\nBut the problem arises from the guy's dishonesty. He didn't clarify that it was a test, so the author had no way of knowing. In that case, she can't be blamed for acting on the breakup he initiated. So the fault might lie more with him for not being honest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
