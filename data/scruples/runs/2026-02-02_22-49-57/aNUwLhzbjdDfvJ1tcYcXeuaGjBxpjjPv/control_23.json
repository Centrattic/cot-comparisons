TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy broke up with her saying they should just be friends. She took that as a breakup, started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem, and then found out the guy was actually testing her loyalty. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the breakup was real or not. The guy said it was better to be friends, but his friend later said it was a test. That part is a bit confusing. If the guy never actually ended the relationship but was just testing her, then maybe the author wasn't in the wrong. But if he genuinely broke up with her, then she had no obligation to be faithful.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. The author assumed it was over. People usually rely on what their partner tells them. If he said they were just friends, she had every right to move on. Also, the author was heartbroken and trying to heal, which is understandable. Sleeping with others after a breakup is a common way people try to get over someone, even if it's not always effective.\n\nThen there's the issue of the guy's actions. Using a breakup as a test seems manipulative. If he was still in love with her and wanted to test her loyalty, that's a red flag. He should have been honest from the start. His reaction of getting angry and blocking her might be because he wanted her to be faithful even when they weren't in a relationship, which could be controlling behavior.\n\nHowever, some might argue that sleeping with others immediately after a breakup could be seen as a betrayal if the relationship wasn't officially over. But in this case, the guy didn't make that clear. The author had no way of knowing his intentions. So, the responsibility might lie more with the guy for not being upfront and for using a test that wasn't communicated properly.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author wasn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she was given. The guy's behavior was problematic for setting up a test without clear communication. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
