TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup that they thought was real. The guy later claims it was a test and is upset about her moving on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The relationship was over as per the guy's statement. He said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. She believed the breakup was genuine. Now, the guy is angry and blames her for moving on, even though he didn't express any issues during the time she was doing so. \n\nThe main issue here is consent and mutual agreement in the relationship. If the breakup was real, then the author is not obligated to remain celibate. The guy's actions of breaking up and then trying to test her loyalty seem manipulative. He didn't communicate his intentions clearly, which is a problem. The author acted based on the information she had at the time, which was that the relationship was over. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even after a breakup, there's an unspoken expectation of not sleeping with others immediately, especially if the breakup is recent. But in this case, the guy didn't specify any terms post-breakup. The author's actions were a personal choice to heal, which is often recommended in such situations. \n\nThe guy's friend revealing the test implies he was dishonest from the start. If he was still in love, he should have communicated that instead of pulling a disappearing act. His anger after the fact, particularly when she wasn't aware of his test, makes his behavior questionable. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She made decisions based on the breakup being real, and the guy's lack of clear communication and subsequent test are his own faults. The answer should be B.\n"
