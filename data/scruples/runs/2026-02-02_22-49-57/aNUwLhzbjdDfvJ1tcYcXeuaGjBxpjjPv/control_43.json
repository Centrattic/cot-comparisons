TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup, but it turns out the breakup was a test. \n\nFirst, the guy said he wanted to be just friends, so the author assumed it was a real breakup. He never said it was a test. The author, feeling heartbroken, started dating others to boost self-esteem. Now, the guy is upset because he was testing her loyalty.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. When the guy initiated the breakup, he didn't clarify that it was a test. The author had no way of knowing. She acted based on his stated intention to be friends. So, from her perspective, she wasn't cheating because they were no longer in a relationship. The guy, however, had hidden motives. \n\nEthically, once a relationship is broken, unless there's a mutual agreement to take a break or test, the ex-partner isn't obligated to remain celibate. The author's actions were based on the breakup being real. The guy's test was deceptive. So, the fault might lie more with him for not being honest. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have confirmed if it was a real breakup. However, the guy was adamant about being friends, so she had reason to believe it was over. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the information given. The guy's test was unethical. So answer B.\n"
