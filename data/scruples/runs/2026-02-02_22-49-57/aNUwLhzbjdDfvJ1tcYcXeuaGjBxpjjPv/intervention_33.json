TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after sleeping with others following a breakup that turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the guy broke up and said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, moved on by using Tinder and slept with others. She thought they were no longer a couple, so she didn't feel obligated to be faithful. Then, the guy reveals the breakup was a test to see how she'd act if they broke up. He's angry she slept with others, leading to a block.\n\nNow, the key points here. The original breakup was communicated as a real break. The author made the choice based on that information. If the guy didn't clarify his intentions, he might be at fault for leading her to believe it was over. However, he later claims it was a test, which complicates things. \n\nBut fidelity in a relationship is mutual. If they were still emotionally involved after the breakup, maybe expectations were unspoken. However, the author had no reason to know it was a test. She acted on the information given. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he didn't set clear boundaries. \n\nAlso, testing someone's loyalty through a fake breakup is manipulative. The author isn't wrong for acting on a breakup that was presented as real. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
