TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the guy breaks up with her, telling her they should just be friends. She's heartbroken but eventually moves on and starts using Tinder. She sleeps with others, thinking they're not in a relationship anymore. He later reveals the breakup was a test to see how she'd react. He's angry she slept with others and blocks her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did something wrong. The key points are: the breakup was supposedly final, she didn't know it was a test, and he's upset about her actions. But since he ended the relationship, he had no right to expect her to wait. She thought they were over, so her actions were based on that assumption. Even if his breakup was a test, that doesn't make her actions wrong because she couldn't have known. Loyalty in a breakup is expected only when the relationship is ongoing. Once it's over, the obligations change. Plus, using Tinder to boost self-esteem after a breakup is a personal choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's anger stems from his own deceptive actions. Therefore, answer B.\n"
