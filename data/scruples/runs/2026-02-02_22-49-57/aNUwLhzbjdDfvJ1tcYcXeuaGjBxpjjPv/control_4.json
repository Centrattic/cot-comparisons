TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup, only to find out the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, the original situation: the guy called it off, said they should be friends, and the author moved on by dating others. The key point here is that the author believed the relationship was over. If a breakup is communicated, even if it's later revealed to be a test, the person on the receiving end has a right to act based on that information. \n\nThe guy's actions are a bit shady. Using a breakup as a test is manipulative. The author, in good faith, trusted the breakup was real. So, moving on by seeing others isn't her fault because she had no reason to know it was a test. The author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship had ended. \n\nThe guy is upset now, but his initial decision to fake the breakup makes him at least partially responsible. The author's mistake was trusting the breakup was genuine. But since she had no way of knowing, she's not in the wrong. The problem lies more with the guy's dishonesty. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author wasn't in the wrong given the circumstances she was aware of.\n"
