TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend, who then started dating others on Tinder. But then it turned out the breakup was a test, and he's upset because she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The breakup was initiated by the guy, and he said they should be just friends. The author thought it was over, so she started seeing others. But the guy later says it was a test to see if she'd stay faithful, which she didn't, so he's angry.\n\nNow, from a typical perspective, if someone ends a relationship, the other person is within their rights to move on. The guy's actions here are a bit manipulative, using a fake breakup as a test. The author didn't know it was a test, so she acted on the assumption that they were no longer a couple. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't wrong per se unless there were specific agreements. But the guy later claims he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty, which is a bit of a double standard. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is communication. The guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. The author made a decision based on what he told her. In most cases, after a breakup, being with others isn't cheating unless there's an agreement otherwise. But in this case, since the guy later says it was a test, it complicates things. \n\nBut the author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. The guy's problem seems more about his own manipulation and not clearly communicating his intentions. The author isn't in the wrong for moving on, especially if the breakup was genuine at the time. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
