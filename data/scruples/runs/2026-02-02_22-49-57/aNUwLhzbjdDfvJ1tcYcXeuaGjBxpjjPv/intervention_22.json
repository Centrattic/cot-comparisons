TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the guy broke up with the author, they were just friends, and then the author started dating others. But now the guy is upset because he said the breakup was a test and he's angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author thought the relationship was over, so she moved on. The guy claims he broke up as a test to see her reaction. The author didn't know it was a test, so she acted based on the assumption that they weren't together anymore.\n\nFrom a general perspective, if someone ends a relationship and says they want to be friends, the other person is usually expected to respect that and not continue the relationship. But the author here did what she thought was appropriate after the breakup, which is seeking to move on by dating others. The guy's action of breaking up as a test without clear communication is a bit manipulative, as he didn't express his true intentions.\n\nThe author isn't obligated to stay single if the relationship was officially over. The responsibility here might lie with the guy for not being honest about his intentions. The author made a decision based on the information she had. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the belief that the relationship had ended. The guy's anger stems from his own deceptive behavior. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
