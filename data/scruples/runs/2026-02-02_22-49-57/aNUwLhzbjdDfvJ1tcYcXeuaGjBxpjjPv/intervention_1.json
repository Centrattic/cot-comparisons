TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy said they should just be friends. She took that as a breakup. Her self-esteem was low, so she used Tinder and slept with others. Now the guy is mad, claiming the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay loyal. He's furious and blocked her.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are consent and mutual understanding. When a relationship ends, unless there's an agreement otherwise, sleeping with others isn't inherently wrong. But the twist is that the guy's \"breakup\" was a test. However, if he didn't communicate that it was a test and the author genuinely believed it was over, then she had no reason to know. \n\nFrom her perspective, she thought it was a breakup, so she moved on. The guy, on the other hand, didn't clarify his intentions. If he wanted to test her loyalty without being honest, maybe he's the one at fault for not being clear. Cheating in a relationship is wrong, but if the relationship is over, she wasn't cheating. The problem is his lack of honesty. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more. If the guy still wanted to be with her but used a breakup as a test, that's a bit manipulative. Her actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. So she's not in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's anger stems from her not knowing he was testing her, which is unfair. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
