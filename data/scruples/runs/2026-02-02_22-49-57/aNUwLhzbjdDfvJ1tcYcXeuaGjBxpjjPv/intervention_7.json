TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She, feeling heartbroken and needing to boost her self-esteem, started using Tinder and slept with others. Later, she found out that the break-up was a test by him, and he's angry now because she slept with others when they weren't in a relationship anymore.\n\nHmm. So the key points here: When they broke up, he said they should be friends. She thought it was a real breakup, so she moved on by sleeping with others. But he was just testing her, and now he's upset. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, fidelity in relationships. If they were truly broken up, then technically she wasn't cheating. Cheating usually implies being unfaithful while in a committed relationship. Since he ended the relationship, she's not obligated to remain faithful. But here's the twist: he didn't actually end the relationship; he was testing her. However, from her perspective, he said it was over. She had no way of knowing it was a test. She acted on the information given to her.\n\nBut some might argue that maybe she should have known. But how? He was clear about wanting to be friends. She was heartbroken, and he was adamant. She took his word as final. So she made decisions based on that. Now he's upset because he was just testing her. That seems a bit manipulative on his part. If he wanted to test her, maybe he shouldn't have done it in a way that led her to believe the relationship was over.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was sleeping with others to help her self-esteem and move on doesn't make it wrong. It's a personal choice she made after the breakup. Even if she's still in love with him, she's trying to heal. So from an ethical standpoint, if the relationship was truly over, she's not in the wrong. The issue might be more on his side for using a fake breakup as a test. But the question is about her.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. Because he ended the relationship, and she acted accordingly. He's the one who was deceptive. However, some people might say that even if it was a breakup, maybe she should have clarified, but given the situation, it's reasonable she took his word as final.\n"
