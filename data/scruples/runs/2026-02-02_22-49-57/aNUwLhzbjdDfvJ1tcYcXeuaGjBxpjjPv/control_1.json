TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, saying they should just be friends. The author then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. But later found out the break-up was a test, and the partner was actually still in love and wanted to see the author's reaction. Now the partner is angry because the author slept with others after the break-up.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The main issue here is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. The partner claimed it was a breakup, so from the author's perspective, they were single and had the right to date others. But the partner later says it was a test, implying they never intended to end the relationship.\n\nSo, the author thought they were single, and the partner didn't clarify that it was a test. The author acted based on the information they had. However, sometimes in relationships, even if someone says they want to break up, if there's ambiguity, it can lead to misunderstandings. But in this case, the partner was adamant about being just friends and the author took that at face value. \n\nThe partner's actions of not communicating clearly about the \"test\" might be their fault. The author didn't know it was a test, so they made a decision based on the breakup. However, some might argue that sleeping with others immediately after a breakup, even if the relationship was on shaky ground, could be seen as moving on too quickly, which might hurt the other person's feelings if they were still attached.\n\nBut in this case, the partner's friend revealed that the breakup was a test, which suggests the partner was manipulating the situation. The author wasn't in the wrong for trusting the breakup as final. So the partner is at fault for not being clear and for creating the test scenario. The author acted on the belief that the relationship was over, so they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
