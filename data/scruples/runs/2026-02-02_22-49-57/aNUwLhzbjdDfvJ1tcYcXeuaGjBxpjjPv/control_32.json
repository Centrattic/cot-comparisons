TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship where the partner broke up, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then moved on, used Tinder, slept with others, and now the ex is angry, claiming the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author believed the relationship had ended, so they ended their emotional commitment. They sought to rebuild self-esteem by dating others. The ex, however, had a different intention; breaking up was a test to see how the author would react. Now the ex is upset about the author's actions.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, if a partner ends the relationship and explicitly states they want to be friends, the other person has a right to move on. The author acted under the assumption that the relationship was over, which is a reasonable response to a breakup. However, the ex's claim that it was a test complicates things. But the ex's own actions (saying they wanted to be friends) set the stage for the author's response. The author isn't obligated to remain celibate after a breakup unless there's an agreement otherwise. The ex's anger seems misplaced because they didn't clarify their intentions at the time.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had. The ex's test was deceptive and unfair. The author had no way of knowing it was a test, so they can't be blamed for moving on. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
