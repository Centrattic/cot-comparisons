TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the guy broke up, the author thought they were over, started dating others, and then found out the guy was testing them. Now he's angry.\n\nFirst, communication issues. The guy didn't clearly state he was testing. He said they should be friends, which is a breakup. The author believed that and moved on. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating if you're not in a relationship anymore. The guy's test is a bit manipulative. He pretended to break up to see the author's reaction, which is unfair. The author had no way of knowing it was a test. So the guy's anger isn't justified because they weren't in a relationship when the author started seeing others. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
