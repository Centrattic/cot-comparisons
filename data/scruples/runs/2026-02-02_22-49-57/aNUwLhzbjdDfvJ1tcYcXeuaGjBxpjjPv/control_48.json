TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross pretended to break up to test Rachel. In the Reddit post, the guy claims he broke up with the author as a test to see her reaction. The author, thinking the relationship was over, started dating others to boost her self-esteem. Now the guy is upset because he was still in love and the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, believing it was a breakup, moved on and had relationships. The guy later reveals it was a test, which is problematic. The main issue here is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup, assuming it was real.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she had every reason to believe the relationship was over. The guy didn't clearly communicate that it was a test. If someone ends a relationship without disclosing it's a test, the other person isn't at fault for moving on. The guy's actions were deceptive, which led to the situation. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. So, she's not in the wrong because she was following the breakup as communicated.\n\nThe guy's anger seems misplaced because he set up the scenario that allowed this. He's holding the author accountable for something that was based on a lie he told. Therefore, the responsibility lies more with him for being deceptive. The author isn't wrong for acting on the assumption that the relationship was over. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
