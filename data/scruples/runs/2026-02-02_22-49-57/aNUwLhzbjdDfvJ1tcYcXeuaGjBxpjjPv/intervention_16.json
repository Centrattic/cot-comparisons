TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends. The author was in a relationship where she was in love, but her partner didn't reciprocate the same feelings and decided to break up, wanting to just be friends. She continued talking to him after the breakup, then started dating others to boost her self-esteem. She believed they were no longer a couple, so sleeping with others was okay. However, the guy later revealed that his breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and now he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she was wrong. The key points are the communication around the breakup and the expectations of exclusivity. In a typical breakup, if one person ends the relationship and the other moves on, that's usually acceptable. However, in this case, the guy didn't actually end the relationship but was using a test. The ambiguity here is crucial. If the breakup was genuine, then she wasn't in the wrong for moving on. But if the breakup was a ruse, then maybe she was wrong for not recognizing his manipulative behavior.\n\nBut the problem is that she believed they were broken up. If he didn't make that clear that it was a test, she had no way of knowing. Relationships require mutual understanding and communication. If he didn't communicate that he wasn't actually ending the relationship, then she acted based on her belief. Also, the fact that he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty complicates things. However, it's not her responsibility to know that his breakup was a test unless he made it clear. She had the right to move on after a breakup, especially when he initially said they were just friends. So, she's not in the wrong. The guy's actions were manipulative, and he's holding her responsible for something that wasn't her fault because he didn't communicate his true intentions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
