TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with the author, claiming they wanted to be just friends. The author then started dating others via Tinder, thinking it was okay since they were no longer together. The guy later admitted the breakup was a test to see how the author would react, and now he's angry about her sleeping with others. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author believed the relationship was over. The guy didn't clearly communicate his intentions, which were ambiguous\u2014he said they should be friends but later said it was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. The author acted based on the info she had at the time, thinking the breakup was genuine.\n\nIn relationships, clear communication is crucial. The guy's actions were deceptive. If he wasn't clear about his feelings and intentions, he might be at fault for leading her on. The author had every right to move on, especially if the breakup was real. The guy's test seems manipulative because he didn't express his true feelings honestly. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the information she had, and the guy's ambiguity and later test are his own issues. The answer here would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
