TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, she then slept with others, and he later revealed the breakup was a test. She's being blamed for sleeping with others after the breakup, but he didn't clarify that it wasn't actually over.\n\nFirst, the key point is the definition of a breakup. If the guy said they were just friends and he was adamant about being friends only, then from her perspective, the relationship was over. In that case, she might have every right to move on and date others. However, if he later claims the breakup was a test, implying he never really wanted to break up, then the problem is on his side for not being clear. \n\nCheating typically requires a mutual agreement to be in a committed relationship. If they were no longer in a relationship, then sleeping with someone else isn't cheating. The issue here is that he didn't communicate his true intentions. She acted based on his initial breakup statement, so she can't be blamed for trusting his words. \n\nAlso, emotional harm can come from both sides. She was hurt by the breakup and tried to heal, which is understandable. His reaction of blocking her and being furious might be more about his own dishonesty and failed test rather than her actions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the breakup was declared by him, and she acted accordingly. The fault lies with him for not being honest about his intentions.\n"
