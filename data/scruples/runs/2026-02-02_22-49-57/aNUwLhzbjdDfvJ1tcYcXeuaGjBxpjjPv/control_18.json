TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author is asking if they're at fault for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the guy said he wanted to be friends, which the author accepted. The author felt the relationship ended, so they moved on by dating others. But the guy later reveals it was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. Now he's angry.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author know it was still an ongoing relationship? The guy claimed to break up, and the author acted on that by ending the relationship. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating unless there's an agreement otherwise. The guy's test makes this tricky. He didn't clarify the status, so the author had a reasonable assumption. The guy's actions (blocking, anger) might stem from his own poor communication. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted on the information given. So, answer B.\n"
