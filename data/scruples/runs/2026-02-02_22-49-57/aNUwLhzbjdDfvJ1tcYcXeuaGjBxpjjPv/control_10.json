TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a guy broke up with her, she assumed it was a breakup, started dating others, and then found out he was testing her by breaking up. Now he's angry that she dated others when they weren't officially together.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about consent and communication. When the guy said they should be friends, she took it as a breakup. She had no obligation to stay celibate unless there were specific agreements. The guy later claims it was a test, but she had no way of knowing that. He set up a scenario where he expected her to stay loyal without being in a relationship, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nFrom her perspective, after a breakup, it's normal to seek emotional support or move on, especially if the other person wasn't committed. However, she was still emotionally attached and used Tinder to boost her self-esteem. The problem arises from his unexpected test and his subsequent anger without clear communication. \n\nLegally and ethically, once the relationship ended, she's free to date. But the guy's actions\u2014using a fake breakup as a test\u2014complicate things. The question is whether she was wrong without knowing his true intentions. Since he didn't communicate his test, her actions were based on the information she had. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
