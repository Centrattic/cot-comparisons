TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit tricky. So, the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to boost self-esteem, started dating others via Tinder. Then the guy reveals the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and he's angry because she slept with others even though they were no longer a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard relationship norms. When someone breaks up, it's generally assumed the relationship is over, so being with other people isn't cheating. The guy said it was over, so the author had every right to move on. But then he later says it was a test, which is really manipulative. Testing someone's loyalty after a breakup like that is unethical. He's creating a false situation to see if the person would stay committed, which isn't fair. The author didn't know it was a test, so she acted based on the information she had. She isn't at fault for trusting his words and moving on. The guy's actions are problematic because he lied about the breakup's purpose. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
