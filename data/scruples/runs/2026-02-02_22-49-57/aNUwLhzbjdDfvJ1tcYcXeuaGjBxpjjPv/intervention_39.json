TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup. The key points here are the timeline and the intentions.\n\nFirst, the guy claimed they were just friends after breaking up, but now claims it was a test. The author thought they were over and moved on, which makes sense emotionally. She used dating apps to regain her self-esteem, which she felt was shattered post-breakup. That seems like a personal coping mechanism.\n\nBut the twist is that the ex wasn't actually done; he was testing her. However, the author didn't know that at the time. She acted under the belief they were separated. Cheating is usually defined as being unfaithful in a committed relationship. Since the author thought the relationship was over, her actions wouldn't be cheating by her standards. \n\nHowever, if the guy never actually ended the relationship and just tried to push her away, that's a problem. But since he presented it as a breakup, the responsibility isn't on the author. She had no way of knowing it was a test. His actions of breaking up and then testing her loyalty could be seen as manipulative. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. She made a decision based on the information she had, which was that they were no longer a couple. The ex's behavior is questionable, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
