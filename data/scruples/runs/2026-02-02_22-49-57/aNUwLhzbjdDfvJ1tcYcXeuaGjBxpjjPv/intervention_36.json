TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, the author moving on by sleeping with others, and then the ex getting angry after revealing the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't express the same feelings. He ended the relationship, saying they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others via Tinder. Then, the guy admitted that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay loyal. He got angry when she moved on, blocked her, and won't talk.\n\nNow, considering the question of who is in the wrong. The main issue here seems to be the guy's honesty and the author's actions after the breakup. The guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test at the time, which is a problem. He pretended to end the relationship, which is deceptive. The author thought they were no longer a couple and thus had no obligation to remain faithful. \n\nIn most relationships, if someone ends it, the other person is free to move on. The guy's test was unethical because he didn't communicate his true intentions. The author acted based on the assumption that the relationship was over. So, from that perspective, she might not be in the wrong because she had no reason to know it was a test. However, some might argue that sleeping with others so soon after a breakup could be seen as moving on quickly, but in this case, the context is clearer because the guy's actions were manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's actions are problematic. Using a breakup as a test is a form of manipulation. He expected loyalty without being honest about his feelings. The author's actions were based on the information she had at the time. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong because she didn't know it was a test. The fault lies more with the guy for being deceptive.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted based on the breakup being real and the ex's test was deceitful.\n"
