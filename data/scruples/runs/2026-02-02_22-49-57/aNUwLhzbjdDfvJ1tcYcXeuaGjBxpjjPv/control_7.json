TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after sleeping with others following a breakup that wasn't actually a breakup. The key points here are the context of the relationship and the intentions behind the breakup.\n\nFirst, the guy initially told the author he wanted to be friends, which the author accepted. The author then moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. However, the guy later revealed this breakup was a test to see how the author would act. He was still in love and didn't really want to end the relationship. Now, he's angry about the author sleeping with others during this time.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was in a committed relationship when she started seeing others. If the breakup was genuine, then she's not in the wrong because they weren't a couple anymore. But since the guy didn't actually end the relationship permanently and kept talking to her, it's unclear if they were still together. The author assumed it was a breakup, so she acted accordingly. The guy's actions\u2014pretending to break up to test her\u2014might contribute to the confusion. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the assumption that they were no longer a couple. She used Tinder to boost her self-esteem after his initial breakup. While sleeping with others immediately after a breakup might be seen as hasty by some, the main question is the status of their relationship at the time. If the guy hadn't actually ended things and was just testing her, then the author might have been led on. However, the guy's responsibility is in not being clear about his intentions. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup he declared. The guy's anger stems from his own deceptive behavior. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
