TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy said they should be just friends, and then the author started seeing others. Now the guy is upset, but it turns out he broke up with her as a test to see if she'd stay faithful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy initiated the breakup and said they were just friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and wanting to rebuild her self-esteem, started dating others. She believed the relationship was over. The guy later admitted the breakup was a test and is now angry because she moved on. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she thought the relationship was over. If someone ends a relationship and you start dating others, is that wrong? Well, in a typical breakup scenario, if one person ends it, the other moving on is usually not considered cheating. However, there's a nuance here because the guy was testing her. But the problem is that he didn't communicate his intentions clearly. If he truly wanted to be just friends, then the author's choice to date others isn't wrong if she believed the relationship was over. However, the guy's actions of breaking up as a test are manipulative. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she acted on the belief that the relationship was over, and the guy's test was an underhanded move, she can't be blamed for taking steps to move on. The guy's lack of clear communication and his manipulative test are his own issues. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation of exclusivity even during a \"friends\" phase? Wait, the guy said they were just friends. If he expected her to remain celibate, that's unrealistic unless there was a prior agreement. The author didn't have an obligation to stay loyal once the relationship was supposedly over. \n\nSo the author's actions were reasonable given the information she had. The guy's anger is misplaced because he didn't clearly communicate his boundaries or his intention to test her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
