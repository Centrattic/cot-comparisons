TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario where one person ends the relationship, the other moves on, and then the first person reveals they were just testing the waters.\n\nFirst, the guy broke up with the author, told her they should just be friends, and was adamant. The author, heartbroken, tried to rebuild her self-esteem by using Tinder and sleeping with others. She believed they were no longer a couple, so she had no obligation. Then the guy admitted the breakup was a test to see her reaction. He's now angry and blocked her.\n\nSo the key points here are consent and communication. The original breakup was clear from the guy's side. The author acted under the assumption that the relationship was over. The guy's \"test\" was deceptive because he didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions. The author made a decision based on the information she had at the time. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, if a partner has ended the relationship and the other moves on, it's not wrong. The deception here is on the guy's part. The author can't be blamed for acting on the breakup as real. However, sleeping with others so quickly might be seen as moving on too fast, but that's more about personal judgment than right or wrong.\n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), because the author wasn't wrong given the information she had. The guy's actions were deceptive, making him at fault for not being honest about his intentions.\n"
