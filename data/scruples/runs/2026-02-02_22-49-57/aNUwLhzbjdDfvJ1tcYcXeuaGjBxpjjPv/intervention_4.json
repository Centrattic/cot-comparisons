TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that turned out to be a test.\n\nFirst, the guy says they should be just friends, and the author assumes it's over. She uses Tinder to get over the breakup, sleeps with others, thinking she's not obligated anymore. Then he reveals he was testing her loyalty, even though he broke up with her. Now he's angry because she moved on.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. When a breakup happens, the expectation is that the relationship is over. The author acted on the belief that they were no longer a couple. The guy, however, had a hidden agenda. He used the breakup as a test without being honest. Cheating typically involves being in a committed relationship and having affairs, but here the author thought the relationship was over. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a gray area. If he told her to be friends but was still emotionally involved, maybe there was some ambiguity. However, the author made a reasonable assumption based on his declaration of a breakup. She didn't know about the test. \n\nCheating is about betrayal, but if the relationship is over, then moving on isn't cheating. The man's anger stems from his own manipulation. The author's actions were in response to a breakup, which is a common way to cope with heartbreak. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the information she had. The guy's actions were deceitful. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
