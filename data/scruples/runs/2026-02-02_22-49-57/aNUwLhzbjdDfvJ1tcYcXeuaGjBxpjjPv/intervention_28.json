TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, thinking they should just be friends. The author tried to move on by dating others, which is a common reaction when someone is heartbroken and wants to rebuild self-esteem. Then the guy later admitted that his breakup was a test to see what she would do, and he's upset because she slept with others.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the nature of the breakup and the author's understanding of their relationship status. Since the guy said they were breaking up, the author believed they were not in a relationship anymore. In that case, moving on and being with others wouldn't be infidelity because they weren't exclusive anymore. However, the guy's intention was a test, which complicates things. But from the author's perspective, she acted based on the information she had at the time. She didn't know it was a test, so she made a decision based on what she thought was a real breakup.\n\nAlso, the guy had been clear about wanting to be friends, so the author had no reason to believe the relationship was still ongoing. Even though he later claims he was in love and tested her, the author's actions were a response to what she perceived as the end of the relationship. So in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault because she acted in good faith based on the breakup. The guy's actions of using a breakup as a test might be questionable, but that's on him. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
