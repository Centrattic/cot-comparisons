TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship with a guy. He said they should just be friends, which ended the relationship. The author felt heartbroken but tried to move on. To boost their self-esteem, they used Tinder and slept with others. The guy later admitted that his breakup was a test to see if she would be loyal. Now he's angry and blocked her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the guy said they were just friends, the author thought it was a breakup, and then moved on. But he actually intended to test her loyalty. The author's actions (sleeping with others) were based on the assumption that they were no longer in a relationship. So, was the author in the wrong?\n\nIf the guy never actually ended the relationship but only tried to test her by pretending to break up, then technically, maybe the author didn't know the relationship was still ongoing. However, the way the guy framed it as a breakup might lead the author to believe it was real. The author's actions were based on that assumption. \n\nIn relationships, fidelity is usually expected while the relationship is active. But if the guy didn't communicate that they were still together, then the author might not be at fault for moving on. The problem here seems to stem from the guy's manipulation by using a fake breakup as a test. That's a bit underhanded. \n\nSo, if you enter a relationship with the intention of testing someone's loyalty by breaking up, that's the manipulative party's fault. The author acted based on the information given. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed what was presented as a breakup. The real issue is the guy's dishonesty and manipulative behavior. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
