TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who slept with new people after a breakup is in the wrong. The situation is similar to Ross and Rachel's \"we were on a break\" scenario from Friends. \n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship and was told by their partner that they wanted to be just friends. The partner was adamant about this, leading the author to believe it was a legitimate breakup. Feeling heartbroken, the author used Tinder and had sex with others as a way to boost self-esteem. However, the partner later revealed that the breakup was a test to see the author's reaction, which it wasn't. Now the partner is angry and blocked the author.\n\nThe key points here are the author's perception of the breakup and the partner's hidden intentions. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship, so they didn't feel obligated to be faithful. The partner, on the other hand, used a breakup as a test, which is manipulative. The author acted based on their understanding of the situation, not knowing it was a test. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, fidelity is expected within a relationship. However, once a relationship is ended, even if one party is still in love, the other is free to move on. The partner's approach of using a fake breakup as a test is problematic because it's deceptive. The author didn't know the truth, so their actions were based on what they believed to be the actual status of their relationship.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they made decisions based on the information they had. The fault lies with the partner for being dishonest and using a breakup as a manipulative test.\n"
