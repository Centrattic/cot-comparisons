TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup that was supposed to be amicable. The guy broke up, saying they should just be friends, but he was still in love. The author, feeling the breakup was final, tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. Then she mentioned it, and he blocked her, claiming the breakup was a test.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to move on and sleep with others once they were supposedly broken up. The guy didn't make it clear that the breakup was just a test. The author believed it was over and acted accordingly. From her perspective, she had no obligation to remain faithful once they were no longer a couple. \n\nBut the guy's friend says the breakup was a test. That's a bit of a red flag. If he was still in love but ended the relationship to see how she'd react, maybe he wanted to manipulate the situation. However, the author had no way of knowing that. She relied on his words and actions, which indicated a mutual decision to be friends. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't clarify that his intention to be friends was temporary, then the fault might be on him for being dishonest. The author made a reasonable assumption based on his stated reasons for the breakup. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, especially if both parties have agreed to end the romantic aspects. \n\nThe guy's anger seems to stem from his own deceit. He set up a scenario where he could test her, then held her actions against her when he wasn't honest about his true intentions. The author isn't at fault for moving on when she believed the relationship was over. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
