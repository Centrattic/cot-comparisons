TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She went on Tinder, slept with others, thinking they were no longer a couple. Then he turned out to be testing her and got mad because she slept with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as she presented them. She thought it was a breakup, so she wasn't in a relationship anymore. If they were truly broken up, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. But wait, he said the breakup was a test. That's a bit manipulative, maybe? If he never actually ended the relationship, then maybe she was still in a committed relationship, and sleeping with others would be cheating.\n\nBut according to her account, he told her to be just friends. So she had no reason to believe they were still in a relationship. She acted on the information given. If he lied about breaking up, then the problem is on his end. But if he didn't explicitly confirm the breakup and just hinted, maybe there's ambiguity.\n\nAlso, fidelity in relationships usually requires mutual agreement. If he told her it was over, then she was free to date. Unless he never actually ended things, but made a fake breakup to test her. That's tricky. The key is whether there was a mutual agreement to end the relationship. If she believed it was over, then she's not at fault. But if he never meant to end it, and she slept with others, then maybe she was unfaithful.\n\nAnother angle: the guy's test. Using a breakup as a test to see if someone stays faithful is unethical. If he wanted to test her, that's manipulative. But if he genuinely broke up and then later changed his mind, then she had no obligation. So the question is whether the breakup was real or not. Since she thought it was real, she's not at fault. The problem is on his side for not being clear and then getting angry.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, if a person is in a relationship and their partner is \"testing\" them by pretending to break up, then sleeping with others during that time could be considered cheating. However, the person shouldn't be punished if they believed the breakup was real. So the responsibility lies with the partner who lied about the breakup.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information given to her. The guy's test was manipulative, and she had no way of knowing it wasn't a real breakup. So the answer is B.\n"
