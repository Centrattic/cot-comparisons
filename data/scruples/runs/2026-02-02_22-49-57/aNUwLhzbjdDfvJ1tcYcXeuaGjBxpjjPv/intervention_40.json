TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with her, she thought they were done, and then she started seeing other people. Now he's upset because he said the breakup was a test and he's mad she moved on. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of relationships and boundaries. When one person ends a relationship, the other is generally expected to respect that and not continue the relationship unless there's mutual agreement. But in this case, the guy claimed to break up, but later said it was a test. That's a bit manipulative, right? Because he didn't communicate his real intentions. \n\nThe author believed they were broken up because he told her. She had every reason to think they were no longer in a relationship, especially since he was adamant about being friends. So, after the breakup, she tried to rebuild her self-esteem by dating others. That's pretty common. People move on after a breakup. \n\nBut then he claims he was still in love and the breakup was a test. If that's the case, he shouldn't have initiated a breakup in the first place. It's not fair to test someone's loyalty if you haven't communicated your intentions. She acted based on his words and the situation he presented. \n\nAlso, fidelity in a relationship is usually expected while the relationship is ongoing. Once it's over, there's no obligation to stay loyal. So she wasn't cheating or anything like that. The issue here is that he didn't clarify his true feelings and then got upset when she moved on. \n\nThe key point here is communication. He didn't make his intentions clear. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, that's his responsibility to communicate. The author had no way of knowing that the breakup was a test. She acted on the information she had. \n\nSo, in terms of who is in the wrong, it seems like the guy is being dishonest and manipulative. The author isn't in the wrong because she followed through with the breakup he initiated. It's the guy's fault for not being upfront. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
