TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, which is a classic example of a breakup and getting back together. The author was in a relationship but wasn't sure if the guy loved them as much. He broke up, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually started talking to others on Tinder and had sex with some people. Now, the guy is angry because he considered the breakup a test and is upset she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are consent in the breakup and understanding the relationship status. The guy said it was a breakup, so the assumption was that they were no longer in a romantic relationship. If he genuinely meant to end the relationship, then the author isn't in the wrong for moving on and seeking new relationships. However, if the breakup was a test, which the author wasn't aware of, there might be some ambiguity. But in most cases, a breakup is considered final unless communicated otherwise. The author acted based on the information she had at the time, which was that they were friends. She didn't know it was a test, so she might not be at fault. On the other hand, if the guy's intention was to test her, he could be the one at fault for not being clear and setting up a situation where she might be in a gray area. But the question is about the author's actions. Since she believed the relationship was over, sleeping with others after that would be her right. The guy's anger stems from his own hidden agenda, not her actions. So the answer is probably B, no.\n"
