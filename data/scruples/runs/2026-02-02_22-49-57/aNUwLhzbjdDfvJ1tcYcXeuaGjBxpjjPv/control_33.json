TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario. The author was in a relationship, the guy broke up and said they should just be friends. She went on Tinder and slept with others, thinking it was okay because they were no longer a couple. Then he reveals the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the guy called it off, saying they should be friends. The author assumed the relationship was over. She started dating others, which she thought was acceptable. Later, he says the breakup was a test. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the breakup was genuine or just a test. If he never actually ended the relationship and it was a test, then she was wrong to sleep with others. However, if he genuinely broke up with her and she was justified in moving on, then she's not at fault. \n\nBut how do we determine that? The user is asking for an opinion. The guy said they should be friends, and she took him at his word. Even if it was a test, he didn't make that clear. She acted based on his statement. In most cases, if someone breaks up with you and says they want to be friends, the reasonable assumption is that the relationship is over. So, she has the right to move on. The guy's actions (not being honest about his intentions) might be the problem here. \n\nBut some might argue that if he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, then she might have violated his expectations. However, without clear communication that the breakup wasn't final, she can't be blamed for acting on the information given. \n\nIn terms of morality, fidelity is usually expected in a committed relationship. If they were still technically a couple, then she would be wrong. But since he ended it, she's not in the wrong. The guy's test was manipulative. So the answer is B.\n"
