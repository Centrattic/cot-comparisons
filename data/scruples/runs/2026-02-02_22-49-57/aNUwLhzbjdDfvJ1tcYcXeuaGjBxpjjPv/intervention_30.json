TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to move on, started using Tinder and slept with others. However, the partner later revealed that the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. Now he's angry and blocked them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship, so they moved on by sleeping with others. The partner, on the other hand, orchestrated a breakup test without being honest. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were acting based on the information they had. If the partner had truly ended the relationship, the author had no obligation to remain faithful. The partner's actions here are manipulative because they created a false scenario to test the author's response. The author had every right to seek emotional and physical comfort after a breakup. \n\nOn the flip side, the partner claims they were still in love and used the breakup as a test. However, this is a form of emotional manipulation. The partner didn't communicate their intent, which is a violation of trust even if the relationship wasn't officially over. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted in good faith based on the partner's statement. \n\nMoreover, the partner's anger seems misplaced. If they wanted to test the author, they could have communicated their true feelings instead of creating a false breakup. The author had the right to move on, and the partner's reaction is more about their own insecurity or manipulative behavior than the author's actions. \n\nI should also consider if there's any ambiguity. The partner said they wanted to be friends, which typically implies the end of the romantic relationship. The author's actions post-breakup are within their rights unless there were specific agreements otherwise. Since the partner's test was unspoken, the author isn't at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
