TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy initially broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost her self-esteem, thinking the relationship was over. But now he's telling her that the breakup was a test, and he's angry because she slept with others when they weren't officially together anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy said he wanted to be friends, so he ended the romantic relationship. From her perspective, it was a breakup, so she felt free to date others. But he later claimed it was a test. The key here is whether there was a mutual agreement on the breakup. If he didn't clarify that it wasn't a real breakup, then she had every right to move on. However, if he intended to keep some sort of exclusive arrangement even after the breakup, that's another matter.\n\nBut according to the story, he said it was better to be friends. She thought the relationship was over. In that case, sleeping with others isn't cheating because the romantic relationship had ended. The problem arises if he didn't communicate clearly. He might have been in a \"friends\" situation but still expected exclusivity, which isn't typical in a breakup unless both parties agree to that. \n\nHowever, after a breakup, unless there's some sort of open relationship agreement, people usually expect the other person to move on. So if she did move on, that's normal. But if he was testing her loyalty, that's a bit manipulative on his part because he didn't communicate his true intentions. \n\nSo, the author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. Unless there was some hidden arrangement, she's not in the wrong. The guy's anger stems from his own ambiguous behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
