TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to a Ross and Rachel scenario. The guy breaks up with the author, claiming they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts seeing others on Tinder. Then the guy says the breakup was a test, he's still in love, and gets angry when she slept with others.\n\nFirst, the author thought it was a real breakup. If someone ends the relationship, even if it's a test, the other person has the right to move on. The key point here is the communication. The guy didn't clearly state that it wasn't a breakup. He said they should be friends, but the author didn't know it was a test. \n\nCheating is usually about being unfaithful in a committed relationship. But in this case, the author believed the relationship was over. So sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating. The guy's fault is for not being honest about his intentions. He set up a situation where he could later claim it wasn't a real breakup, which complicates things. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for trying to move on. It's natural to seek comfort or new relationships after a breakup. The guy's anger seems misplaced because the problem lies in his lack of clear communication. The author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
