TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel storyline from Friends, where Ross's breakup with Rachel was a test, and she ended up dating someone else, which Ross took as a betrayal.\n\nSo, the key points here: The guy breaks up with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts dating others on Tinder. Then, the guy reveals that the breakup was a test to see if she'd still be faithful. When she slept with others, he got angry and blocked her.\n\nFirst, the author believed they were no longer in a relationship. If the guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test, then the author had every right to move on. The problem here is that the guy's actions were deceptive. By pretending to break up to test her loyalty, he set up a scenario where the author wasn't in the wrong for moving on. In a healthy relationship, both parties should be honest about their intentions. The guy's behavior is manipulative because he didn't disclose his plan. The author acted based on the information she had, which was that the relationship was over. Therefore, the guy is at fault for being dishonest and for creating a situation where his test led to her moving on. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted according to what was communicated to her. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
