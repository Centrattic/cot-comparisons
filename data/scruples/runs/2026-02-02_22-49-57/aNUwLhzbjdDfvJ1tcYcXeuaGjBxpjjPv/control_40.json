TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but the other person wasn't showing the same level of commitment. The guy decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but tried to move on. To boost their self-esteem, they started dating others via Tinder and had sex. Then, when the ex mentioned this, the guy got angry and blocked them, later revealing that the breakup was just a test to see how the author would handle it. Now he's upset because she moved on.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the breakup real or a test? The author thought it was real and acted accordingly. Since they believed they were no longer in a relationship, sleeping with others could be seen as their right. However, the guy claims it was a test, which complicates things because it implies he never intended to break up, just to see her reaction. \n\nIf the author had known it was a test, she might have handled things differently. But she didn't. Ethically, if a breakup is mutual or one-sided but agreed upon, the person is free to date others. The issue here is the deceit from the guy's side. He didn't communicate his true intentions, which led to the author moving on. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might hurt the guy's feelings once he realized his own strategy backfired. But from the author's perspective, she had every right to seek comfort and rebuild her self-esteem after a breakup, especially since he had insisted on ending the relationship. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. Since the guy misrepresented his intentions, the author can't be held responsible for acting on what she believed was a real breakup. The fault lies with the guy for using a fake breakup as a test without clear communication. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
