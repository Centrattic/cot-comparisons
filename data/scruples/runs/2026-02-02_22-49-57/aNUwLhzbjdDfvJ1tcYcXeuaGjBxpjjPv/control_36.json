TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup, which turned out to be a test by her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The guy called it off, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to rebuild her self-esteem, used Tinder and had sex with others. Now the ex says it was a test and he's angry because she moved on, even though he claims he's still in love.\n\nSo, the key points here are the definition of the breakup and the ex's intentions. If the breakup was mutual and they were no longer in a relationship, then the author isn't in the wrong for moving on. However, if the ex never actually ended the relationship and it was just a test, then she might have been in a relationship still, making her actions infidelity. But the ex's friend says he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, implying he might have misled her. \n\nThe author thought it was a breakup, so from her perspective, she's not cheating. But the ex's actions were deceptive. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If she believed they were no longer in a relationship, then she's not at fault. The ex's anger stems from his own manipulative test. \n\nBut some people might argue that even if it's a test, the ex was still in a relationship and the author should have clarified. However, the ex was the one who initiated the breakup, so the responsibility is on him. The author isn't wrong for sleeping with others if she thought they were over. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
