TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was in a relationship with someone who broke up with them, saying they just wanted to be friends. The author then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost their self-esteem after the breakup. Now, the ex claims that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and he's upset about them sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the breakup. The ex didn't clearly communicate that the breakup was a test; he just said he wanted to be friends. The author took that at face value and moved on. If someone breaks up with you and says it's over, isn't it reasonable to start dating others? The author didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on the information they had.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of emotional maturity. The author was in love, got rejected, and tried to cope by sleeping with others. Some might say that's using people to feel better, even if they weren't in a relationship anymore. However, once the relationship is over, unless there's an agreement to stay exclusive, the author isn't obligated to be faithful. The ex's test seems manipulative because he never clearly stated his intentions. Testing someone's loyalty after a breakup by pretending to break up could be seen as deceitful.\n\nThe key here is whether the ex's actions were deceptive. If he intended to test the author's fidelity, he should have been honest about his intentions. The author had no way of knowing it was a test, so acting on the assumption that the relationship was over isn't necessarily their fault. The ex's anger might stem from his own manipulative behavior rather than the author's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered that the ex might still have feelings and that sleeping with others could hurt him, even if they were supposed to be friends. But if the ex truly wanted to be friends, then the author's actions wouldn't be wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the ex admitted it was a test, he was being dishonest, which complicates things.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author acted based on the ex's stated intention to be friends. The ex's test was a deception, and the author had no reason to know. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that was supposedly over. The ex's issue is with his own manipulative behavior rather than the author's actions.\n"
