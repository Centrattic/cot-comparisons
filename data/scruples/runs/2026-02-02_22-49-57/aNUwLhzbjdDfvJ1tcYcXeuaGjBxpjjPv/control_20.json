TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author was in a relationship with a guy for a few months. She was in love with him, but he never said he felt the same. He decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but continued talking to him. Then, after getting over the breakup, she started using Tinder and slept with others. She thought it was okay because they weren't dating anymore. But now he's angry because he says the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful, and she failed.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. The guy ended the relationship, clearly stating he wanted to be just friends. The author, after some time, moved on and started dating others. That sounds like she's doing what's reasonable after a breakup. But the twist is that the guy's \"breakup\" was a test. However, in a real relationship, if someone ends it with the intention of testing the other's fidelity, that's a problem. The author had no way of knowing it was a test. She acted based on the information she had at the time, which was that they were no longer in a relationship.\n\nNow, thinking about accountability. The guy didn't communicate that the breakup was a test. He just said they should be friends. The author had every right to believe that the relationship was over and that she wasn't in a committed relationship anymore. So, by moving on and sleeping with others, she wasn't being unfaithful because there was no active relationship. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he set up a test without being honest about his intentions.\n\nBut maybe some people would argue that if the relationship had a history of jealousy or if there were hints he wasn't over it, she should have been more cautious. However, in the given context, the guy was adamant about being friends, so the author had no reason to suspect a test. It's also important to note that his refusal to talk to her now might be his issue, as he's acting out of a lack of communication.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were about rebuilding her self-esteem after a breakup, which is a common and understandable reaction. She didn't have any obligation to remain faithful once the relationship was over. The fact that he blocked her immediately upon learning about her new relationships suggests he's in denial about his own decision and is now holding her accountable for something that wasn't part of the agreed terms.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup he declared. His anger stems from not being honest about his intentions, which is his responsibility. So the answer should be B.\n"
