TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that turned out to be a test. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy called it off, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts dating others on Tinder to boost self-esteem. They thought they were over, so sleeping with others was okay. Then, the guy says he was testing her loyalty by breaking up, and he's angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy's actions\u2014was he clear about the breakup? Did he have the right to test her like that? And then the author's actions\u2014was she wrong to move on?\n\nThe guy didn't explicitly confirm the breakup. He said he wanted to be friends but didn't clarify if they were still a couple. The author assumed it was a breakup. If the guy was still considering it a relationship, then maybe she was wrong to sleep with others. But if he genuinely ended it, then she wasn't in a relationship anymore. However, there's ambiguity here. The guy's test seems manipulative because he didn't communicate his true intentions. Testing someone's loyalty by breaking up is deceptive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acted on the assumption they were not together. She used Tinder after the breakup, which is common for people to do when they're single. But if the guy's test meant he was still in the relationship, then she might have been unfaithful. But since he didn't clarify, it's unclear if there was a mutual understanding of the breakup.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. The guy's actions were deceptive, which complicates things. The author's actions were based on the information she had. She might not be in the wrong if the breakup was real. But if he was still in the relationship and she didn't know, then she could be in the wrong. However, the guy's test makes him also at fault because he didn't communicate properly.\n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The guy's behavior was manipulative, and she acted based on his initial breakup statement. The problem is the lack of clear communication. Since the guy didn't make it clear they were still an item, she had a right to move on.\n"
