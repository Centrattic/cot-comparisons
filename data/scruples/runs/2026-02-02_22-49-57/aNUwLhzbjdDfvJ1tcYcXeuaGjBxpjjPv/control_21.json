TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, the author thought it was a breakup, started seeing other people on Tinder, and then the guy turned out to have been testing her. Now he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship, so she thought it was okay to date others. The guy claimed he broke up to test her loyalty. The main issue here is consent and communication. If the guy broke up with her, even if it was a test, from her perspective, it was a breakup. She wasn't in the relationship anymore, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. However, he didn't make that clear. He used a breakup as a test, which is manipulative.\n\nFrom the author's side, she acted based on the information she had. The guy's friend later said the breakup was a test, but at the time, she had no way of knowing that. Cheating usually requires a current relationship and mutual exclusivity. Since she thought it was over, she wasn't in a relationship anymore. So she couldn't be cheating. However, the guy felt betrayed because he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. His actions were deceptive.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance here. If the guy never clearly ended the relationship, but she assumed it was over, it's his fault for not communicating. But she also might have been in her right to move on. However, the fact that he was testing her loyalty is problematic. It's a manipulative tactic, and he should have been honest about his intentions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup. The guy's behavior was manipulative. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
