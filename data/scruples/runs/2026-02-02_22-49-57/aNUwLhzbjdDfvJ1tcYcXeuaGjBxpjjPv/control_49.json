TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel story, which I know is a classic example of on-again, off-again relationships. The user is asking if they're at fault for sleeping with others after their partner broke up with them, claiming it was just a test.\n\nFirst, the guy says he broke up to be friends, but the user thought it was a real breakup. They started dating someone new and slept with others to boost their self-esteem. Then the guy reveals it was a test, and he's angry. \n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the user have a clear understanding that the relationship was over? If the guy never explicitly said it was over, maybe there's confusion. However, in most cases, when someone says they want to be friends, that's usually a breakup. The user acted on the assumption that they were no longer in a relationship, which seems reasonable unless there was some prior agreement that being friends was a trial period.\n\nThe guy's friend mentioned that the breakup was a test to see what the user would do. Testing someone by breaking up and seeing their reaction is manipulative. The user didn't know that, so their actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. \n\nIn relationships, being unfaithful when the relationship is still active is cheating. But here, the user thought they were single. So, unless there was an agreement that the breakup was a test (which there wasn't), the user isn't in the wrong. The real issue is the guy's manipulative behavior for testing her loyalty without being honest. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted based on the information they had, and the problem lies with the other person's deception.\n"
