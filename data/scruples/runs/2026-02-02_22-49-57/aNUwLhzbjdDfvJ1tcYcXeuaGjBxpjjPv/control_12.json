TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel breakup from Friends, so that's a clue. The author was in a relationship where the guy (let's call him John) broke up, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem, used Tinder and had sex with others. Now John is mad because he claims the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful, and he blocked her after she mentioned sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the nature of the breakup and the author's actions post-breakup. If John actually ended the relationship and said they should be friends, then the author's assumption that they were no longer in a relationship is valid. In that case, she's not in the wrong for moving on and seeking new relationships after a breakup. However, the twist is that John claims it was a test. That adds a layer of deception. If he never communicated that the breakup was a test, then he's the one who acted in bad faith. The author had a right to believe they were over, so sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice once the relationship is terminated.\n\nBut wait, there's a problem here. If the guy said they were just friends after the breakup, but the author continued to have contact and then moved on, was that contact a factor? The author mentions they \"carried on talking,\" but if John had already ended it, that's part of the transition. However, once the breakup is confirmed, the author's actions are her own. The issue becomes whether sleeping with others is considered wrong, but ethically, after a breakup, it's generally acceptable unless there's an agreement otherwise. The guilt here might be on John for not being clear and using a test as an excuse after the fact. The author isn't wrong for taking steps to heal and move on, even if it didn't help her get over him. John's anger stems from his own deception, so the fault isn't on the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
