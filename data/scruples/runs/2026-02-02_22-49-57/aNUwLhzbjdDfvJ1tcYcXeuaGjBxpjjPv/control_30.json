TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for sleeping with others after what they thought was a breakup, but turns out the guy was just testing them.\n\nFirst, the author believed the relationship was over. If you're in a breakup, you're not in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. But then the guy says he broke up because he wanted to test if they could be just friends. That's a bit messed up because usually, a breakup isn't a test. If he was still in love and testing, maybe he didn't communicate that well. But the author wasn't aware of his true intentions.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author acted based on the belief that they were single. The guy's action of using a breakup as a test without clear communication might be his mistake. However, if the author had known the breakup wasn't real, their actions would be different. Since the guy didn't clarify his intentions, the author isn't entirely at fault. But maybe there's a mutual miscommunication here. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted on what they believed to be the truth. The guy's reaction is also problematic because he used a breakup as a test, which isn't a healthy approach.\n"
