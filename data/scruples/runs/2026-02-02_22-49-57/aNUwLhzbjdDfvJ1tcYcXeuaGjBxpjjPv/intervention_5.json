TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after what they thought was a breakup. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross tried to make Rachel jealous by sleeping with other people after a fake breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author believed they were broken up because their partner said it was better to be just friends. The partner was adamant about being friends only, so the author moved on, started using Tinder, and slept with others. The author's reasoning was that since they weren't in a relationship anymore, there was no obligation to be faithful. However, the partner later admitted the breakup was a test and is now angry about the author's actions.\n\nNow, the key issue here is consent and communication. If the partner ended the relationship and said they wanted to be just friends, then the author was justified in moving on. Cheating typically refers to being unfaithful in a committed relationship. But this case is tricky because the partner later claimed the breakup was a test, implying they never intended to end the relationship. However, at the time of the breakup, the author had no way of knowing this. The partner didn't clarify that it was a test; they just broke up and insisted on being friends. So the author acted based on the information they had.\n\nAnother angle is emotional manipulation. The partner used the breakup as a test to see if the author would be faithful, which is a form of emotional control. The author's actions were a response to being dumped and trying to heal. The partner's anger seems hypocritical because they didn't communicate their true intentions.\n\nBut then there's the question of loyalty. Even if they were broken up, maybe the partner still had feelings, and the author's actions hurt them. However, the partner was the one who initiated the breakup, so their expectations might be misplaced. The author isn't obligated to remain faithful once the relationship is over unless there was an agreement otherwise.\n\nIn terms of cheating definitions, if the relationship was officially over, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, if the breakup was a test and the partner considered it ongoing, that's a different scenario. But since the partner didn't communicate this, the author can't be blamed for not knowing.\n\nAlso, the author was trying to boost their self-esteem after a breakup, which is a common coping mechanism. The partner's reaction seems unfair because they didn't make their intentions clear. The author's actions were a response to being dumped, not to continue a relationship. The partner's anger might stem from their own manipulative behavior rather than the author's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the partner truly felt the breakup was a test and expected the author to stay away from others, then the author might be at fault for not respecting that unspoken expectation. But since the breakup was presented as real, the author had no reason to comply. The partner's dishonesty complicates things.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, it seems the author isn't in the wrong because the breakup was presented as genuine, and they acted accordingly. The partner's actions were manipulative, making the author's response understandable.\n"
