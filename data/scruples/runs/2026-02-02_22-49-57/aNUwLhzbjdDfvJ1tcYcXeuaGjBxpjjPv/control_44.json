TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The key points here are the breakup, the author's actions of sleeping with others, and the revelation that the ex wanted to test the relationship.\n\nFirst, the guy said they needed to be just friends after breaking up. The author took that as a breakup and decided to move on by dating others. But the ex claims it was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to have sex with others after the breakup. Since the ex didn't confirm they were no longer in a relationship and instead was testing the waters, the author might have been acting on the assumption that it was over. But from the ex's perspective, they were still in a relationship, so the author's actions could be seen as cheating. However, the ex's decision to test the relationship without clear communication is problematic. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. They believed they were no longer in a relationship. But the ex's behavior of breaking up and then testing the author's loyalty creates ambiguity. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted on the breakup being real. However, the ex's lack of clarity and manipulative behavior is the root issue here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they followed what they believed to be the breakup. The ex's test was dishonest and unclear, leading to the conflict.\n"
