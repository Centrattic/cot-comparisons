TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup, the author starting to date others, and the ex being upset because he considered the breakup a test.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy broke up with her, saying they should be friends. She moved on, used Tinder, and slept with others. He later reveals the breakup was a test to see her reaction and is now angry. The author is asking if she's at fault.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and communication. When a breakup happens, even if it's not explicitly final, if both parties believe the relationship is over, then moving on isn't inherently wrong. The problem arises from the guy's hidden agenda. He pretended to break up as a test, which is manipulative. His actions set up a scenario where he expects her to remain faithful without mutual agreement, which isn't fair.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she acted on her understanding of the situation. She thought they were done, so she sought to rebuild her self-esteem. There's no indication she cheated while the relationship was ongoing. The fault here might lie more with the ex for not being honest and using a breakup as a test. Manipulation like that is generally considered unethical.\n\nHowever, some might argue that sleeping with others immediately after a breakup could be seen as insensitive if there were lingering feelings, but the author states she's still in love with him. Still, the ex's actions were deceitful. Since the breakup was his decision and he didn't clarify his intentions, the author isn't at fault for moving on. The responsibility is on the ex for the manipulation. So, the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
