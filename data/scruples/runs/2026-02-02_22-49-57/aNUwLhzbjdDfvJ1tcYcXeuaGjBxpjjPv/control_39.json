TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is that the author was in a relationship where they were really in love, but the guy said they should just be friends. The author thought it was a breakup and started seeing others. Now the guy is mad, but he actually broke up with her as a test to see if she would be faithful.\n\nHmm, first, the key point is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. If they were no longer in a relationship and he said it was just friends, then technically she wasn't in a committed relationship anymore. So from that perspective, she might not be in the wrong because she was acting on his decision to end their romantic relationship.\n\nBut wait, the twist is that he broke up with her as a test. That's a bit manipulative, right? He used a breakup as a way to check her loyalty. So his actions were deceptive. If he was still in love and just wanted to test her, then maybe he shouldn't have led her to believe it was a real breakup. If he didn't make it clear that it wasn't an actual breakup, then she had a reason to believe it was over. \n\nThe question is whether she had the right to move on and date others after he told her to be friends. Since he didn't clarify it was a test, she acted based on his words. So maybe she's not at fault because he didn't communicate the truth. On the other hand, if he considered it a real breakup, then she was single and allowed to date. But his test makes it seem like he's holding her to some standard even though he didn't make that clear. \n\nIt's tricky. The main issue is consent and communication. Since he didn't tell her it was a test, she made a decision based on the information she had. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The guy's actions were deceptive, so he might be at fault here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
