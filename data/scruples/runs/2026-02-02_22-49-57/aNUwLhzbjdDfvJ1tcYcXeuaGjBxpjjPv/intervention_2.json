TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario, which I know from Friends, where Ross breaks up with Rachel, but they keep having on-again, off-again issues. Here, the guy breaks up with the author, claims they should just be friends, but later says it was a test to see if she would be faithful. The author starts seeing others on Tinder, thinking they're not a couple anymore, and then the guy gets mad when she tells him about it and blocks her.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by sleeping with others after the breakup. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy initiated the breakup, saying they should be friends. If a relationship has ended, the usual expectation is that both parties are free to date others unless there's some agreement otherwise. The author believed the relationship was over, so she moved on by using Tinder. That seems reasonable because once a relationship is officially over, there's no obligation to remain faithful.\n\nHowever, there's a twist here: the guy later claims the breakup was a test. But if he didn't communicate that at the time, that's on him. The author couldn't have known he was in love and just wanted to test her. People can't assume they can manipulate relationships like that without clear communication. The guy's actions of breaking up and then testing her fidelity without being upfront about his intentions is problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the guy is upset about her sleeping with others after they were no longer in a relationship. But if he had truly wanted to be just friends, then his anger at her dating others is hypocritical. Unless there was some unspoken agreement or expectation that they weren't to date others while being friends, which isn't typical. Usually, once a relationship ends, both are free to move on.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that since they weren't in a relationship anymore, she had no obligation to remain loyal. That makes sense. The guy's test might be a way to justify his feelings, but he didn't set clear boundaries. His friend's information reveals his true motive, but the responsibility lies with him to communicate that. The author didn't have access to that information at the time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions and lack of clear communication led to this situation. He broke up with her, she moved on, and his test was a manipulative way to check her loyalty without being honest from the start. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
