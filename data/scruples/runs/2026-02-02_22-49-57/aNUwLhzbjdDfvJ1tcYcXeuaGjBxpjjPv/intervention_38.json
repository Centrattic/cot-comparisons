TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

So, the situation is that she was in a relationship with a guy who called it off, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with other people. Now, the guy says that his breakup was actually a test to see if she was faithful, and he's upset she moved on, leading him to block her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The guy ended the relationship and said they should be friends. She accepted that and started seeing others. From her perspective, once the relationship was over, she had no obligation to remain faithful. The key point here is whether the breakup was genuine or not. The guy later claimed it was a test. But from her side, she had no reason to believe that. She made the decision based on his stated intention to end the relationship. \n\nSo, if the breakup was real, then she's not at fault. But if he never actually intended to end things and was just testing her, maybe she made a mistake by moving on. However, she had every reason to believe the breakup was legitimate. People can't be expected to second-guess every breakup in case it's a test. That seems unfair. Also, the guy's reaction is problematic because he's angry at her for moving on after he ended things. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve manipulation like this test.\n\nAnother angle: the guy didn't clarify that his breakup was a test. If he had communicated that he still wanted to be in a relationship but just wanted to see her reaction, that's different. But he didn't. So she acted in good faith based on the information given. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The guy's behavior is what's questionable here.\n"
