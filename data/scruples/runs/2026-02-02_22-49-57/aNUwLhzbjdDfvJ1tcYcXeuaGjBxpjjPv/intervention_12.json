TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy said they should be friends, and then after a breakup, the author started dating others. The guy later claims the breakup was a test and is now angry about the author sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy initiated the breakup, said they should be friends, and the author, thinking it was a real breakup, moved on by using Tinder. The guy later says it was a test and he was still in love, but now he's upset. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. If the breakup was real, then the author isn't obligated to be faithful. The guy's claim that it was a test seems manipulative. He didn't communicate his feelings clearly and then held the author to a standard of fidelity after he himself ended the relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have checked if they were officially over. But in relationships, when someone says they want to be friends, it's generally accepted as the end of the romantic relationship. The guy didn't make it clear that he was still in love or that the breakup was a test. He only revealed this after the fact. \n\nAlso, the author's actions were a way to cope with the breakup, which is common. The fact that the guy is now angry after his own ambiguous behavior could make him seem at fault. The key here is mutual communication and understanding the status of the relationship. The author acted based on the information provided, which was that they were broken up. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
