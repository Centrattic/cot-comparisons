TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then moved on, used Tinder, slept with others, and now he's upset because he was actually testing her loyalty. He blocked her and is angry. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline and the intentions. The guy broke up with her, saying they should be friends. She took that as a breakup, which is a common assumption. If someone says they want to be friends after a breakup, it's reasonable to think the relationship is over. The author then moved on, which is understandable for healing. She didn't have an obligation to stay faithful if they were no longer in a relationship. \n\nBut then the twist is that the guy was using a breakup as a test. That's a bit manipulative. He didn't clarify his intentions and led her to believe the relationship was over. So, if the breakup wasn't real, then technically they were still in a relationship, and sleeping with others could be considered cheating. However, from the author's perspective, she had no way of knowing that. She acted based on the information given to her at the time. \n\nBut wait, the breakup was declared by him. If he later claims it was a test, but she accepted the breakup and moved on, then she might not be in the wrong. The responsibility here is on him for not being honest about his intentions. The author is in a tough spot because he led her to believe the relationship was over, and she made decisions based on that.\n\nOn the other hand, if there was no official end to the relationship, even if he said they should be friends, maybe there were still unspoken expectations. However, typically, a breakup is the end unless there's some agreement otherwise. The author's actions were based on the breakup being real. \n\nIn most cases, once a breakup is declared, the ex is free to move on. The fact that he was testing her loyalty is problematic. It's like a form of manipulation, which is his fault. The author had no reason to know he was testing her, so she's not at fault for acting on the breakup as it was presented.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The guy's actions were deceptive, and the author made decisions based on the breakup he declared. The responsibility for the situation lies with him for not being honest about his true intentions.\n"
