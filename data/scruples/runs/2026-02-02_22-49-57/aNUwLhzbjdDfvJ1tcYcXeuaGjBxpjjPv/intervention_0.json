TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends. The guy broke up with the author, claiming they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. Then the guy revealed it was a test, and he's now angry.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author thought they were broken up. The guy said they should be friends, so the author assumed it was over. The guy didn't communicate his true intentions clearly; he was testing her. The author acted on the belief that the relationship was over. The guy is now upset because he was still in love and trying to see her reaction.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, when someone ends a relationship, even if there's lingering feelings, the expectation is that they are no longer exclusive. However, if the guy didn't actually end the relationship but was testing her, that's a problem. But from the author's point of view, she had a right to move on if she believed it was over. The guy's actions were deceptive. He didn't clearly state his intentions, leading her to believe the relationship was over. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy is being unfair because he manipulated the situation without being honest. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
