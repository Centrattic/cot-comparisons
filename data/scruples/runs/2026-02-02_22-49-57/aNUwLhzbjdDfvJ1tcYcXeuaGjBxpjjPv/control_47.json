TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't express the same feelings. He broke up with her, saying they should be friends. She then started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. After she mentioned sleeping with others, he blocked her. Later, it turns out he broke up with her as a test to see her reaction, and he's now angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy ended the relationship, so in most people's eyes, once a breakup is declared, the ex is free to date others. The author did exactly that, thinking they were no longer a couple. But then the guy says it was a test, implying he never really wanted to break up. That's a bit of a red flag because manipulating someone like that is dishonest. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as moving on, which is normal after a breakup. However, the guy's approach of testing her is problematic. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, that's underhanded. His anger seems to come from his own manipulation backfiring. \n\nBut some might argue that even if they were broken up, if there was lingering emotional attachment, sleeping with others could be hurtful. But legally and socially, once a relationship is over, people are allowed to date others. The key issue here is the guy's dishonesty in breaking up. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for moving on after a breakup. The guy's behavior is more at fault here for using a fake breakup as a test. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
