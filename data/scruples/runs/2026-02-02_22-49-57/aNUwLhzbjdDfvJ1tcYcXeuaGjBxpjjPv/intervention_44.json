TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with the author, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then slept with others to build self-esteem, thinking the relationship was over. The guy later says the breakup was a test and is now angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, the key point here is consent and the status of their relationship. If he initiated a breakup and said they should be friends, then he ended the relationship. The author had no obligation to stay faithful if there was no ongoing relationship. The guy's claim that it was a test is problematic because he didn't communicate that intent clearly. He broke up with her, so she had no way of knowing he was just testing her. \n\nCheating would require an existing relationship where exclusivity is expected. Since he ended the relationship, the author's actions weren't cheating. His anger stems from his own manipulative behavior by pretending to break up to test her. That's a red flag because he didn't maintain honesty. \n\nHowever, maybe some might argue that if the breakup was a test, then she wasn't supposed to move on. But that's a flawed argument because he led her to believe the relationship was over. The author acted based on the information she had, which was that they were no longer a couple. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed the breakup terms as presented. The guy's actions were deceitful. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
