TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's partner ended the relationship, calling it a breakup to be friends. The author, heartbroken and trying to regain self-esteem, uses Tinder and sleeps with others. Later, she finds out that the breakup was a test; the partner was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. He's now angry and won't talk to her.\n\nSo, the key points here: the partner called it a breakup, the author didn't know it was a test, and he didn't communicate his true intentions. The author acted based on what she was told. From her perspective, they were no longer a couple, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. But the partner had a hidden agenda, which is problematic.\n\nI need to consider fidelity and communication. In most relationships, if one person says it's over, the other is free to move on. However, the partner's actions\u2014using a fake breakup to test\u2014show a lack of honesty. The author had no way of knowing it was a test. She made a decision based on the information given. \n\nHypothetically, if the breakup was genuine, the author wouldn't be in the wrong for dating others. But here, the partner's deception complicates things. However, the author isn't responsible for the partner's hidden motives. She acted in good faith. So, technically, she's not at fault. The partner is the one who didn't communicate honestly. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
