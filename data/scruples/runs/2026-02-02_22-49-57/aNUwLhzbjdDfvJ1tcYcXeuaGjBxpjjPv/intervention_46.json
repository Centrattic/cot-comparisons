TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, the author sleeping with others after, and the ex using a test to determine loyalty.\n\nFirst, the guy claims they're just friends after breaking up, but the author isn't in the relationship anymore. If it's a breakup, even if it's not finalized, the author isn't obligated to stay faithful. However, the twist is that the guy was using a test to see if she'd stay loyal. That seems manipulative. \n\nThe author's actions: she got on Tinder to boost her self-esteem after being heartbroken. She thought they were done, so sleeping with others wasn't cheating. But the guy's approach of breaking up as a test to check loyalty is questionable. Using a breakup as a test is a red flag because it's deceptive.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she acted based on the information she had at the time. She believed they were no longer a couple. The guy's anger stems from his own manipulative behavior. The author isn't in the wrong because she made decisions based on the breakup, which was presented to her as genuine. The guy's actions were deceitful, so the blame isn't on her.\n"
