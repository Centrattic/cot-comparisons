TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, right? The user was in a relationship with a guy who \"broke up\" with her, claiming they should just be friends. She took it as a breakup, started dating others via Tinder, and now he's upset because he was actually testing her and still wanted to be together.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy said they should be friends, the author believed it was a breakup, and then started seeing others. But the guy later admits that the breakup was a test to see her reaction. So the main issue is communication. The guy didn't be clear about his intentions. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, he didn't communicate that properly. The author acted based on the information she had, which was that they were over.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, once a breakup happens, you're not in a relationship anymore, so there's no obligation to be faithful. However, if the guy hadn't clarified that he was keeping the door open, maybe the author made an assumption that was wrong. But he was the one who initiated the breakup, so she had no reason to think it was temporary. Also, in relationships, if someone breaks up with you, you're not cheating by moving on. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here because she followed the breakup as he requested. The guy's fury seems misplaced because he didn't make his intentions clear and then judged her for moving on. \n\nBut some might argue that if he was still in love and wanted to test her, maybe she should have considered that. But how could she know? He told her they were just friends. So the problem is on his side for not being honest. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information given to her. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
