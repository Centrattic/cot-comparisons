TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where they were hopelessly in love with their guy, but he never expressed the same feelings. He decided to break up to be friends, and they continued talking. The author was heartbroken but eventually accepted it. To boost their self-esteem, they used Tinder and slept with others, thinking it was okay since they were no longer dating. However, the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay loyal, and he's now angry and blocked them.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the guy ended the relationship, called it a breakup, and the author believed they were not in a relationship anymore. The author then moved on by dating others, which the guy later claims was a mistake because it was a test. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with others after the breakup.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they made a conscious decision to move on. They felt the relationship was over, so they didn't see any obligation to stay faithful. The guy, on the other hand, never truly ended the relationship in a clear way and later admitted it was a test. This creates a situation where the author was acting based on mutual agreement to end the relationship, while the guy had hidden intentions.\n\nIn terms of relationships, fidelity is typically expected when you are in a committed relationship. However, once a breakup is declared, unless there's an agreement to remain friends with certain boundaries, the previous commitment no longer exists. The author believed the breakup was real, so sleeping with others after that might not be considered cheating. The issue here is the ambiguity of the breakup. The guy's actions (calling it a breakup but then using it as a test) are deceptive. If he didn't clearly communicate his intentions or didn't actually want to end the relationship, that's on him. But the author acted in good faith based on the information they had.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even after a breakup, the person still had feelings and the author moving on quickly could be hurtful. But in this case, the guy's initial breakup was a rejection, and the author's response was to heal by dating others, which is a common way people deal with heartbreak.\n\nAnother angle is whether the guy's action of making it a test was manipulative. If he didn't clearly communicate his feelings and instead used a breakup as a test, that's not fair. The author had no way of knowing his true intentions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for acting based on the breakup, while the guy's behavior is questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup they were told about. The guy's deception is the root of the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
