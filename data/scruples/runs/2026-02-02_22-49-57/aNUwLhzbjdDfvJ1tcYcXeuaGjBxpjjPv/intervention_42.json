TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's ex broke up with them, claiming they just wanted to be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to boost their self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. Later, they found out that the breakup was actually a test, and the ex was still in love. The ex is now angry because the author slept with other people, even though they weren't in a relationship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship, so they didn't see any obligation to be faithful. The ex, on the other hand, was using the breakup as a test. But here's the thing: if the ex was still in love and wanted to be together, why did they initiate a breakup? That seems like it's on the ex's part. The author acted based on the information they had at the time. The ex's \"test\" is a bit manipulative because they're pretending to break up to see the author's reaction.\n\nThe key point is consent and clear communication. The ex didn't make it clear that the breakup was a test. The author has every right to move on if they believe they're single. Cheating typically refers to being unfaithful while in a committed relationship. Since the author thought they were broken up, what they did isn't cheating. However, there's also the aspect of the author still being in love with the ex. But that's more about their emotional state, not necessarily their actions.\n\nThe ex's anger seems misplaced because they didn't communicate their true intentions. The author isn't at fault for acting on the breakup that was presented to them. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
