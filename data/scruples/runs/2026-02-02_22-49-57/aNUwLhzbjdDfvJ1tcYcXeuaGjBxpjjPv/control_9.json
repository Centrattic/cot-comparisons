TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy and the author were in a relationship. The guy decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but agreed, and they continued talking. Then the author, trying to boost self-esteem after the breakup, started dating others via Tinder and had sex with a few people. The author thought that since they weren't in a relationship anymore, there was no obligation to stay loyal. However, the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see how the author would react, and he's now angry that she slept with others, so he blocked her and refuses to talk.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy ended the relationship, the author moved on by sleeping with others, and the guy later says it was a test. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nLooking at the guy's actions first. He ended the relationship and told her they should just be friends. That's a clear breakup. If he truly ended the relationship, then the author had every right to move on. However, he later says it was a test. That's a bit manipulative because he didn't communicate his true feelings. By ending the relationship, he's supposed to be closing the door on the romantic relationship, not setting up a test. So his actions were a bit deceptive.\n\nNow, the author's actions. She was in a breakup and dealing with low self-esteem. She decided to get on Tinder and have sex with others. She did this after the breakup, which she believed was mutual. If the breakup was genuine, then what she did isn't cheating, because they weren't in a relationship anymore. However, the guy claims it was a test, which complicates things. But the problem here is that the guy didn't clarify his intentions. If he hadn't ended the relationship but just wanted to test her, then maybe she was in the wrong. But since he did end it, he's not in a position to be upset about her moving on. \n\nBut wait, maybe the guy's test was part of the breakup. Did he make that clear? The author thought it was a breakup, so she moved on. The guy's friend later said it was a test, but the guy didn't communicate that. So the author had no way of knowing. In that case, the guy is being inconsistent. He ended the relationship, so she's allowed to date others. If he wanted to test her loyalty while still being in a relationship, he shouldn't have ended it. \n\nAnother angle: the author was in a situation where she was hurt and trying to heal. Moving on by dating others is a common way to cope. However, sleeping with people quickly after a breakup might not be the best approach, but it's her choice. The guy's anger is based on a test he never communicated properly. So, he's the one who's acting inconsistently. \n\nAlso, the guy is now angry that she slept with others after the breakup. But if they were just friends, then his expectations of her fidelity are unclear. Unless they had an unspoken agreement that they'd stay single or have a certain understanding, which isn't mentioned here. The author didn't have that expectation, so she's not in the wrong. The guy's problem is that he ended the relationship but still wanted to control her actions post-breakup, which isn't fair.\n\nPutting it all together: The guy ended the relationship, the author moved on, and the guy's test was a miscommunication. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup being genuine. The guy's actions are more problematic because he didn't communicate his true intentions and is now upset about her moving on after he supposedly broke up with her.\n"
