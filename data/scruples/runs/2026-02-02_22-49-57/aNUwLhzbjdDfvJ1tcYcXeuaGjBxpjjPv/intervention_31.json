TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after what they thought was a breakup. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross pretends to break up with Rachel to test her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy ended the relationship and said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and had sex with others, thinking they were no longer a couple. Later, the guy admitted that the breakup was a test\u2014he was still in love and wanted to see how she'd react. Now he's upset that she moved on.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she believed it was a real breakup. If a relationship ends, unless there's an agreement to stay exclusive as friends, sleeping with others isn't cheating. But here, the guy didn't communicate clearly. He ended things but then did a bait-and-switch, which is pretty underhanded. The author acted in good faith based on the information she had.\n\nBut wait, the guy says the breakup was a test. So, technically, he never ended the relationship for good. If that's the case, then the author was still in a de facto relationship, and sleeping with others would be cheating. However, the problem is that the guy didn't make this clear. He gave her a fake breakup, which is a manipulation tactic. The author had no way of knowing it wasn't a real breakup unless he told her. So, she acted on the info she had.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone gives you the impression that the relationship is over, it's reasonable to move on. The guy's actions are deceptive. He set up a scenario where he could have the upper hand in the relationship by testing her loyalty without being honest. That's not fair. The author isn't in the wrong because she made a decision based on the breakup she was told about. The fault lies with the guy for manipulating the situation.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motives were to boost her self-esteem after a breakup. While that's understandable, sleeping with others isn't the healthiest way to cope, but it's not necessarily wrong. The key issue is the guy's lack of transparency. If he had been honest from the start, there wouldn't be a problem. The author didn't have the context to know it was a test.\n\nSo, in summary, the author isn't in the wrong. She acted based on the breakup being real. The guy's deception is the real issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
