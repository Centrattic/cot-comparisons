TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup, only to find out the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, when the author's partner said they wanted to be just friends, the author assumed it was a real breakup. In that case, the author isn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others might be their choice. However, the twist here is that the partner was using the breakup as a test to see if the author would stay loyal. \n\nThe key point is consent and communication. The partner didn't clarify that the breakup wasn't real. If the partner had said, \"I'm testing our commitment,\" then the situation would be different. But since the partner didn't communicate that, the author acted based on the information they had. \n\nBut wait, the partner was still in love and wanted to see the author's reaction. That's a bit manipulative. The author had every reason to believe the relationship was over. So, from the author's perspective, moving on was reasonable. The partner's anger stems from the expectation that the breakup was a test, but they didn't make that clear. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the partner wanted to test, they should have communicated that. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted on the breakup being real. However, maybe the author could have waited longer or communicated their feelings, but the main issue is the partner's lack of clarity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were acting under the assumption of a real breakup. The partner's test was manipulative and not communicated properly. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
