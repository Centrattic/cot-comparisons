TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, the author moved on by dating others, and then found out the guy's breakup was a test. Now he's angry about the author sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to check the facts. The author thought it was a breakup, so they were single. They used Tinder and slept with others as a way to cope. The guy later says it was a test, still in love, and is upset about her actions. \n\nThe key here is consent and mutual understanding. If they were actually broken up, then the author wasn't cheating. The guy's test is a big issue because he didn't communicate his intentions. He broke up with her, then expected her to stay faithful while he was testing her. That's manipulative. \n\nThe author had no way of knowing it was a test. She acted based on the breakup he declared. So, she's not in the wrong. He's the one who created a false scenario. \n\nBut some might argue that relationships aren't over just because one person says so. However, in most cases, a breakup is a mutual decision unless specified otherwise. The guy's actions here are deceptive. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
