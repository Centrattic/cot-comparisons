TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy and girl were in a relationship. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but eventually accepted it. Then she started using Tinder and slept with others. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. But then he revealed that the breakup was a test, and he's angry she moved on. Now he's blocked her.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the breakup actually happen? The guy says it was a test, but the girl believed it was a real breakup. If the breakup was genuine, then she's not in the wrong for moving on. But if the guy never intended for it to be a real breakup, maybe she did something wrong. But how can you test a breakup? That part is confusing. Usually, a breakup is final unless both parties agree to a trial separation. \n\nThe girl had no way of knowing it was a test. She acted based on his words and actions. She thought they were over, so she tried to recover by dating others. The guy, on the other hand, was testing her loyalty. That seems manipulative. If he wanted to test her, it's his fault for not being honest. She had a right to move on after a breakup. \n\nAlso, fidelity is expected when you're in a relationship, but once it's over, people are free to date. The girl did nothing wrong by his own admission. He lied about the breakup, which is the real issue here. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong) because he's the one who was deceptive. She acted on his declaration of a breakup, which was a test, so the fault lies with him for manipulating the situation.\n"
