TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-boyfriend claimed they were done and wanted to be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and to boost her self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. The ex later said he broke up as a test to see her reaction, and now he's angry because she slept with others. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points here are the timeline and the intentions. The author believed they were broken up. The ex said they should be friends, but then later said it was a test. So, the initial breakup wasn't clear. But the author acted under the assumption they were no longer a couple.\n\nNow, was it wrong for her to move on and sleep with others? If they were truly broken up, then no, she's not in the wrong. But if he never actually ended the relationship, then maybe she was cheating. However, the problem is that he was the one who initiated the breakup. The author started dating others after he said it was over. If he was testing her, he's being manipulative. But the author didn't know that at the time.\n\nI think the main point is that the author followed his lead. He told her to be friends, so she considered the relationship over. Therefore, sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice, and she's not in the wrong. The ex is being hypocritical by testing her and then getting angry. So the answer is B, No.\n"
