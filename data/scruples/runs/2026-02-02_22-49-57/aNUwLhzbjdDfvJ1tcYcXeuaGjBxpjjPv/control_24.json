TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with her, she started seeing other people, and then he got upset because he actually wanted to test if she would stay with him.\n\nFirst, she thought it was a breakup, which is valid. If someone ends the relationship, the other person isn't obligated to stay faithful. She's dealing with the breakup by moving on, which is natural. But then it turns out the guy didn't actually want to break up; he was testing her. That's tricky because if he didn't communicate clearly, maybe he's at fault there.\n\nBut wait, he said it was a test. If he wasn't clear about his intentions and she acted based on what she thought was a breakup, then the responsibility might not be entirely hers. However, once they broke up, she wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't inherently wrong. The problem arises if there were unspoken expectations or if he considered them still being in a relationship.\n\nAnother angle: if he lied about breaking up to test her, that's dishonest. She had every right to move on after a breakup, even if it was his way of trying to keep things. But if there was ambiguity in their communication, maybe she should have clarified. However, she did think it was a breakup, so she's not wrong to act on that assumption.\n\nHe's angry now, which makes sense if he didn't actually want to end the relationship and thought she betrayed him. But if she wasn't in a relationship anymore, then maybe he's in the wrong for not being clear. The key here is whether there was a mutual understanding of the breakup. Since he didn't explicitly say it was a breakup and instead called it a test, maybe he's complicating things. But from her perspective, she did what she thought was right after a breakup.\n\nIn conclusion, the main issue is his lack of transparency. She acted on the information given, so she's not necessarily in the wrong. But maybe there's a lesson in not moving on too quickly after a breakup, but that's more about emotional readiness than right or wrong.\n"
