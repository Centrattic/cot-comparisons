TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, but they say it's real. \n\nFirst, the guy ended the relationship and said they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. Then, the guy later admitted he broke up with her as a test to see if she'd stay faithful. Now he's mad she slept with others and blocked her.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, technically, if the relationship was officially over, she's not cheating. Cheating usually involves being in a relationship. If he ended it, then she's free to date others. But wait, he said they should be friends, but maybe there were ambiguous signals. The problem is his admission that the breakup was a test. That's a bit manipulative. If he never actually ended the relationship but just gave her the option to be friends, then she might have been in a gray area. However, the user said he was adamant about being just friends. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author was still in a committed relationship. If the guy ended it, even if later he says it was a test, she acted on the belief that they were over. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she made the decision based on his initial breakup. The guy's actions of using a breakup as a test are manipulative and unfair. He can't hold her accountable for moving on after he ended things. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
