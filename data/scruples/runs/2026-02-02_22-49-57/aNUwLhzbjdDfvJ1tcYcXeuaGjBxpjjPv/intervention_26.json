TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that they believed was real. The guy later revealed it was a test.\n\nFirst, the key point here is consent and mutual agreement. The author thought the relationship had ended, so they moved on. Cheating typically requires both people being in a committed relationship. If the author believed they were single, then technically they weren't cheating. The guy's action of breaking up was a test, which is a bit manipulative because he didn't communicate his true intentions. \n\nThe author acted based on the information they had at the time. Since the breakup was presented as real, sleeping with others isn't a betrayal in that context. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he set up a situation where the author couldn't know the truth. That being said, the guy's approach of using a fake breakup to test the author is problematic. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nSo, considering the author's perspective and the information they had, they aren't in the wrong. The fault lies more with the guy for not being honest. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
