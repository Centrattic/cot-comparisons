TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel thing. The guy broke up with her, she started dating others, and he got upset, but then it turns out the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the guy said they should be friends, she thought it was a breakup, she then slept with others, and he was actually testing her loyalty. \n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. Since the guy claimed it was a breakup, the author reasonably thought there was no relationship anymore. So, if they were no longer in a relationship, sleeping with others isn't cheating. But the guy later admitted it was a test, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she acted based on the information she had at the time. She didn't know it was a test. The guy's actions were deceptive. The author isn't in the wrong because she made a choice based on the breakup he presented. The guy's fury is misplaced because he created a scenario where he could test her without being honest. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The responsibility lies more with the guy for using a fake breakup as a test.\n"
