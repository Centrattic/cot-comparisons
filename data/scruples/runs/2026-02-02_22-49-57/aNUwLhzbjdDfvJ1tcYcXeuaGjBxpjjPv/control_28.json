TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with the author, claiming they should just be friends. The author, trying to move on, got on Tinder and slept with others. Then the guy reveals that the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. He's angry now because she slept with others even though they weren't together anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The guy said they were just friends, so the author believed the relationship was over. In that case, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, especially if the ex was the one initiating the breakup. But there's a twist here: the guy says it was a test, that he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. That's a bit tricky. If he never communicated that he was in love and wanted to test, then he can't really blame her for moving on. However, the question is whether she was wrong to sleep with others during the time she thought they were broken up.\n\nBut there's a problem here. The guy was still in contact with her after the breakup, so maybe there was some confusion about the status of their relationship. If the breakup was supposed to be final, then the author had every right to move on. But if the guy was being manipulative and didn't have the right to expect her to stay single during a \"test,\" then she's not at fault. The key point is that the breakup was declared by him, and she acted accordingly. His test was a hidden motive, which complicates things. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and clear communication are crucial. If he didn't make his intentions clear and then punished her for moving on, that's his issue. The author isn't wrong for seeking to heal and move forward after a breakup. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
