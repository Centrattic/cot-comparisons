TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the author thought they were in a breakup. The guy said he wanted to be friends, and the author took that seriously. The author then started dating others on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. The key point is that the author believed they were no longer in a relationship. So, if they're not in a relationship anymore, sleeping with others isn't cheating, right?\n\nBut then it turns out the guy was just testing her. He wasn't actually breaking up, so from his perspective, she was cheating. However, the author had no way of knowing that. The responsibility is on the guy for not being clear about his intentions. He set up the situation where he could reverse the breakup, which is a bit manipulative.\n\nIn most relationships, once someone says they want to be friends or break up, that's the end of the exclusive relationship. The author acted based on the information she had. So she's not in the wrong because she made a decision after believing they were over. The guy's test was the real issue here. He shouldn't have led her on like that. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
