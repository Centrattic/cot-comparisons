TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to Ross and Rachel from Friends, but the person is saying that the guy broke up with them, they moved on by sleeping with others, but then found out the guy was testing their loyalty, and now he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy called it off, said they should just be friends. The author believed it was a breakup and started seeing others. The guy later revealed it was a test to see if they'd stay faithful. Now he's upset about them sleeping with others.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong. Well, if the guy had ended the relationship and told them to be friends, then technically they were not in a relationship anymore. The author didn't know it was a test. They acted based on the information they had at the time. So from their perspective, they were free to date others. But the guy's test was deceitful. He pretended to break up to test their loyalty, which is manipulative.\n\nNow, the author wasn't cheating because they weren't in a relationship when they slept with others. The problem arises from the guy's deception. However, some might argue that the author didn't consider the possibility of a test, but how could they? The guy didn't indicate it was a test. So the author isn't at fault here. The guy's actions were dishonest. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
