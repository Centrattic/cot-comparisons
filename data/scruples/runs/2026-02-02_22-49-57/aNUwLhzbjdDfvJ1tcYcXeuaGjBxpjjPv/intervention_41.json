TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross breaks up and then later wants Rachel back. Here, the author's partner broke up and said they wanted to be friends. The author then started dating others on Tinder, thinking the relationship was over. Now the ex is upset and claims the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics. The key points are: the ex initiated the breakup, the author believed they were no longer in a relationship, and the author moved on by sleeping with others. The ex later claims it was a test, which adds a layer of manipulation. \n\nIn relationships, fidelity is usually expected when in a committed partnership. If the breakup is legitimate and both parties agree to be just friends, then the author isn't obligated to remain faithful. However, the ex's actions here are questionable because he pretended to break up to test the author. That's manipulative. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. While sleeping with others after a breakup is a personal choice and not inherently wrong, the ex's claim that the breakup was a test complicates things. The author didn't know it was a test, so they acted in good faith. The ex's anger stems from his own manipulative actions, not the author's.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the breakup as communicated. The ex is the one who manipulated the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No)."
