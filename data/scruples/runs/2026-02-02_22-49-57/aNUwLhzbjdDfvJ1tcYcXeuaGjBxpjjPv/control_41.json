TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then slept with other people, thinking they were over. Now he's mad because he was using the breakup as a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and he's furious she didn't. She's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the breakup and the test. The guy claimed they were breaking up, so she assumed the relationship was over. If a relationship has ended, the expectations of fidelity from the ex-partner might vary. But in this case, he was using it as a test, which is a bit manipulative. However, she didn't know that. \n\nIn typical relationships, when someone breaks up and says they want to be friends, it's usually final. If the guy intended to test her loyalty, that's a bit of a red flag. But from her perspective, she had every reason to believe they were done. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't necessarily a sin if both parties agreed to end the relationship. However, if one party is still emotionally invested but hasn't communicated that, it's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: if they were in a monogamous relationship and he ended it, she's not obligated to remain celibate. But maybe there were unspoken agreements. However, since he told her to be friends, the expectation of exclusivity might have ended. The issue here is his deception. He didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions, which led her to act on her own.\n\nBut in terms of fault, if the breakup was genuine, she's not wrong. If he was using her and pretending to break up to test her, that's his manipulative behavior. However, she also acted on her emotions (sleeping with others to boost her self-esteem) while still in love with him, which could be seen as complicating things. But since the relationship was over, her actions don't inherently make her wrong unless there were explicit agreements about post-breakup conduct.\n\nSo, the question is whether sleeping with others after a breakup is wrong. Generally, no, unless there's an agreement against it. Since he said it was over, she's in the right. His anger stems from his own manipulative behavior. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
