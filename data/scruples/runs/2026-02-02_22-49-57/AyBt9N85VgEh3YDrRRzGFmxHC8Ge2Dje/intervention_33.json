She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author wrote about creating an \"Almanac\" where he jotted down personal details about his wife, like her favorite things. He did this to remember them and do sweet things for her. The wife found out and felt betrayed, thinking he was using a playbook instead of genuinely remembering. Now he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the intentions. The author's goal was to remember his wife's preferences and do nice things, which sounds caring. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. However, the wife's reaction is strong\u2014she feels cheapened and betrayed. So there's a conflict between the husband's good intentions and the wife's feelings.\n\nWhy would the wife feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over something planned. If he's using notes, she might feel like he's not making the effort to truly remember, or that he's manipulative. Alternatively, she might see it as a violation of privacy. The term \"playbook\" suggests she thinks he's using a strategy to get points, which could make her feel like he's insincere.\n\nBut the author argues that he's trying to avoid being the guy who forgets important things. He's trying to be attentive. The problem is that the method he chose led to her feeling used. So, was it wrong to use the notes, or was the issue in the wife's perspective?\n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The author didn't mean to hurt her, but he should have considered how she might feel if she found out. Maybe he should have discussed it with her beforehand or found a different way to remember things without making it feel like a tactic. However, the act of keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. The problem arises in the reaction and whether the wife's feelings were valid.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. If he had mentioned that he keeps notes to remember her preferences, maybe she would have appreciated it. But since he kept it a secret, it might have felt like a hidden agenda. So maybe the mistake was not talking to her about it. But the act itself of keeping notes with good intentions isn't wrong. The wife's reaction is about how she felt, which is valid even if the husband didn't intend harm.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were good, and the issue is more about the wife's feeling of being used rather than a malicious act. However, he could have handled it differently by being more open. But ultimately, the answer might depend on whether the method of using notes crossed a line in her eyes. Since he didn't have bad intentions, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
