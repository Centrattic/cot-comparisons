She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he created this Almanac with all these personal notes about his wife, like her favorite things, and he used it to remember and do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook.\" He's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why she's upset. The key points here are trust and consent. The author kept the Almanac a secret, which might have been a problem. Even though his intentions were good, keeping such personal information hidden could make someone feel like their privacy is being invaded. He mentioned he never told anyone about it, which means he didn't get her input on it. Maybe she felt that by writing down all these details, he was treating her more like a project to be studied rather than a partner to be genuinely connected with. \n\nOn the other hand, his intention was to remember important things about her because he loves her. But the way he went about it\u2014without her knowing\u2014might have crossed a line. Trust in a relationship often relies on mutual understanding and consent. If she didn't know about it, she couldn't give consent, which might be why she feels betrayed. \n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" suggests she thinks he's using a script or strategy to manipulate his actions toward her, which could make her feel like his affection is not genuine but planned. Even if it's not the case, the perception is important here. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if his intentions were purely good, but the action of keeping it secret and not discussing it with her might have been the issue. The question is whether the secrecy and lack of transparency were the problem, not the act of remembering her preferences. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had shared the idea with her first, maybe she would have appreciated it. But since he didn't, she might feel that her privacy was violated. So, the wrong here could be in the lack of communication rather than the act itself. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he kept something personal secret without her knowledge, leading to her feeling betrayed, even if his intentions were good. Alternatively, it could be B (No) if the focus is on his good intentions. But since the problem is about perception and trust, the answer leaning towards A seems more likely.\n"
