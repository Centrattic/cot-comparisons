She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about this \"Almanac\" he created. He started writing down things about his wife's preferences, like her favorite color, restaurants, books, etc., to remember them and do sweet things for her. Now, she found out and is upset, feeling like the Almanac is a \"playbook\" that cheapens his gestures and makes her feel betrayed.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was clearly to show his love and care by remembering these details. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. But his wife's reaction is about feeling that it's manipulative, like he's using a list to get points for being attentive. Why would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over something that feels premeditated or rehearsed. If he's using a list, maybe she feels it's not genuine anymore because it's like he's following a script. \n\nBut wait, isn't the act of remembering those things a sign of love? The author mentions that he wants to avoid being the guy who forgets important stuff. So his motivation is good. However, the wife's feelings are valid too. She might feel that having a list makes it less personal. Maybe she prefers that he remembers things naturally without needing a reminder. \n\nThe key here is whether the Almanac was a problem in terms of intent versus perception. The author didn't have any bad intentions; he wanted to be thoughtful. But his wife perceives it as insincere. So maybe the issue isn't about being wrong in an objective sense, but more about a mismatch in expectations. The author isn't in the wrong because he didn't mean to hurt her, but he might need to understand her perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that keeping a secret list could be seen as controlling or not trusting oneself to remember, which could be why she feels betrayed. But the author says he only made the list because he was worried he'd forget, not to manipulate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the intention was good and the wife's reaction is about their relationship dynamics rather than the author's malicious intent. However, he might need to communicate better to understand her feelings and find a middle ground.\n"
