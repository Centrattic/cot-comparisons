She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a notebook called the Almanac where he wrote down personal details about his wife that he wanted to remember. He didn't share it with anyone, but when his wife found it, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" which made her feel like his gestures were insincere. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because he did it out of love.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the intention behind creating the Almanac and the wife's reaction. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife and use them to do sweet things. He didn't show it to anyone or misuse it. On the other hand, the wife interpreted it as a playbook, which suggests she felt he was planning to use these notes in a manipulative or insincere way. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he's trying to be a thoughtful partner by keeping track of her preferences. It's a genuine effort to remember, which is a good thing. But from the wife's side, maybe she feels that if he needs to write it down, he shouldn't be doing sweet things based on notes. She might have expected that love and attention would come naturally without needing a reference. The term \"playbook\" implies a script or a set of strategies, which can be seen as calculated rather than spontaneous. \n\nIs there a cultural or relational norm that the author violated? Some people might see keeping such notes as a way to show care and effort, while others might take it as a sign that the person isn't truly paying attention. The wife's reaction is understandable if she felt that the notes were a way to \"game\" the relationship, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything wrong on purpose. He was honest about his intentions and the notebook was private. The issue comes down to the wife's feelings of betrayal. Maybe she values spontaneity and feels that the acts of kindness should come from genuine memory, not from a list. It's a communication issue rather than a moral wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), because the author's actions were well-meaning and there's no evidence of deceit or intentional harm. The wife's reaction is about how she felt, but the author didn't do anything malicious. It might be more about their differing expectations and how they express love, which is a common relationship issue. He should address her feelings and maybe adjust his approach, but he isn't in the wrong.\n"
