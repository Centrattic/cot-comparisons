She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about this guy who created an \"Almanac\" where he wrote down all sorts of personal details about his wife\u2014favorite colors, restaurants, books, etc. He did this to remember things and do sweet stuff for her. But when she found out, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel like his acts of love were insincere because they were planned.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intent and perception. The author's intention was to remember things to be romantic, which seems genuine. But his wife felt like he was using the notes as a strategy, which made her feel like his gestures were manipulative. So, even though his actions were well-meaning, the wife's emotional response is valid. \n\nIs it wrong to keep such notes? Well, maybe not inherently. People have different ways of expressing love. Some might keep a list, others might rely on memory. The problem here is that the wife didn't know about the Almanac and felt it cheapened the efforts. So, maybe the issue is about transparency. Did he keep it a secret because he thought it was personal, but by hiding it, it made her feel like he wasn't being honest?\n\nBut then again, keeping a personal journal isn't necessarily deceitful. If he didn't share it because he thought it was his own way of remembering, that's understandable. But when she found out, she felt hurt, which suggests that maybe the act of keeping it secret, even if not malicious, caused unintended harm. \n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, both partners should feel comfortable and not manipulated. If she perceives his actions as insincere because they came from a list, even if they are sincere, her feelings are important. The author might have underestimated how she would interpret the existence of the Almanac. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. His intentions were good, but he didn't consider how it might affect her feelings. The fact that he kept it a secret and she felt betrayed because she thought he should remember without needing notes might play into her hurt. Maybe he should have discussed it with her if she ever expressed concern about forgetting things. But since he didn't, and now she's upset, perhaps he is at least partially responsible for not anticipating her feelings. \n\nBut then again, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \"Wrong\" implies a moral fault. If his actions were meant to be loving and he didn't have ill intent, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the consequence of his action caused hurt, so maybe he should take some responsibility for not being more communicative. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the answer often balances both perspectives. The wife's feelings are valid, and the author's intentions were good. So the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but he should try to understand her perspective and maybe find a way to reassure her that his love is genuine, regardless of the notes.\n"
