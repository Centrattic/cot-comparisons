She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and personal details. He did this to remember things so he could do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, thinking he had a \"playbook\" instead of genuinely remembering things. \n\nFirst, the husband's intention was good. He wanted to remember important details about his wife to be considerate and show his love. Keeping notes is a common way people manage information they don't want to forget. However, the wife's reaction is a key part here. She felt that using a notebook made his actions seem insincere, like he was just following a script instead of truly caring. \n\nNow, whether the husband is in the wrong depends on the context. If the wife didn't know about the notebook and expected him to remember things organically, the existence of the notebook might make her feel like he's not making a genuine effort. Even if his intention was good, the wife's feelings of betrayal suggest that this method of remembering didn't align with her expectations of a heartfelt, spontaneous gesture.\n\nThe husband didn't hide the notebook or use it in a manipulative way. He kept it to himself and didn't use it to deceive. But the issue is about perception. In relationships, how one person shows love might not be how the other person receives it. The wife might have felt that the notes were a substitute for genuine memory and effort, which could make her question his commitment. \n\nAlso, communication is important. The husband didn't discuss the notebook with his wife, so she didn't have a chance to express her feelings about it before finding it. This lack of communication might have led to misunderstandings. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong in terms of intent or actions, but he should consider his wife's perspective. The problem might be more about differing expectations of how love and memory should be demonstrated. The author might need to address the wife's feelings and find a way to reconcile their different viewpoints. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the notebook, but he needs to understand why it upset his wife and work on aligning their expectations.\n"
