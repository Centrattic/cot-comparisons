She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who created an \"Almanac\" to remember details about his wife, like her favorite things. The wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like the sweet gestures were cheapened. The author is confused because he thought he was doing something thoughtful, not trying to manipulate or gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's intention was to remember important things about his wife to show his love and not be forgetful. He kept it private, didn't share it with anyone. On the surface, that seems like a positive action. But the wife's reaction is negative\u2014she feels like he's using a playbook, which might make her feel like his actions are insincere or calculated rather than genuine. \n\nThe key here is whether the act of keeping the Almanac was wrong. The husband didn't do anything harmful or deceptive beyond keeping it a secret. However, the wife's feelings matter here. If she feels betrayed, even if his intentions were good, maybe he overstepped by keeping track in a way that made her feel objectified or like he was scripting their relationship. \n\nBut then again, many people keep notes about their partner's preferences. It's a common way to remember things. The problem might be more about how she perceived it rather than the action itself. Was there an expectation of privacy that he violated? Did he keep it a secret because he was trying to surprise her, which is okay, but she found out and it made her uncomfortable? \n\nThe wife's reaction is significant. She felt cheapened, so her emotional response is valid. The husband might have misunderstood her need for genuine, spontaneous gestures versus ones based on a list. Maybe she wanted him to remember naturally rather than rely on notes, which could make her feel like he's not truly paying attention. \n\nBut is the husband wrong? If his intention was good and he didn't intend to hurt her, maybe the issue is about communication. He didn't know she would feel that way. However, keeping a list that's meant to be a personal tool, and then it causing hurt feelings, could mean he's responsible for not considering her perspective. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether intent or the consequence is more important. If the consequence was hurt feelings and betrayal, even with good intent, he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the method was harmless but her reaction is about her own insecurities, maybe he's not at fault. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both parties' feelings. The husband didn't do anything malicious, but the wife's feelings are valid. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation where the wife's feelings are valid, even if his intent was good. The key is that keeping the list wasn't inherently wrong, but the wife's reaction points to a need for better communication between them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
