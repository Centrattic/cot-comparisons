She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who created an Almanac, which is a notebook where he records personal details about his wife, like her favorite things and stuff she mentioned. He uses it to remember things to do sweet things for her. Now, his wife found out and is upset, feeling that it's a \"playbook\" and that it cheapens his gestures, leading her to feel betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's intention was good, right? He wanted to remember important things about his wife because he cares. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But the wife is hurt. Why? Maybe because she didn't know about it, and the idea of him keeping a list of her preferences and using them strategically makes her feel like his actions aren't genuine. Maybe she values spontaneity or feels that the affection should come from the heart, not from a list. Or perhaps there's something else, like privacy concerns.\n\nThe key point here is about intentions versus perceptions. The husband didn't have any malicious intent; he wanted to show he cared. However, the wife's reaction is valid because she's hurt. The problem is that the husband didn't consider her perspective. Maybe if he had discussed it with her first, she might have felt differently. But since he did it without her knowledge, she might see it as a lack of trust in their relationship, as if he needs a list to remember things rather than just caring naturally.\n\nBut wait, the husband's reasoning is that he wants to remember things because he doesn't want to be the guy who forgets important stuff. The wife, on the other hand, feels that the existence of the Almanac undermines the sincerity of his gestures. It's possible that she feels like his actions are rehearsed or calculated rather than spontaneous, which could make her feel like the love is artificial. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband didn't communicate his reasons to her until after she found out. She was upset because she thought he remembered these things naturally, not from a list. The fact that she's considering destroying the Almanac shows how hurt she is. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He didn't mean to hurt her, but he didn't anticipate how she might feel. He kept it a secret, which might have been a mistake. Maybe if he had shared it with her earlier and explained its purpose, she might have appreciated it. But since she found out in a way that made her feel betrayed, he might be at fault for not being more open. However, his intention was positive. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is about intent versus impact, then the husband's intent was good, but the impact was negative. In that case, he's not in the wrong because he didn't know his actions would cause harm. Alternatively, if the action itself (keeping the Almanac secret) is considered wrong regardless of intent, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: some people might see keeping a secret about something that's a gesture of love as unnecessary, especially if the wife had never asked for it. However, the husband thought it was a way to show love. It's a cultural or personal values issue. \n\nIn the end, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the act of keeping the Almanac, even with good intentions, violated trust or privacy. Since the wife was upset about the secrecy and the implication that his actions were premeditated, the husband's mistake was not considering her feelings about the method he used to show love. So, technically, he might not be in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he could be at fault for not being more communicative. However, in the context of the AITA question, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the user is asking for a judgment based on the situation described.\n"
