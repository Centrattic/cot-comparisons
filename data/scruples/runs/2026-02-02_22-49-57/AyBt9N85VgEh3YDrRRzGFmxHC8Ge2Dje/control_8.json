She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he created this \"Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and stuff. He wrote it down because he wanted to remember important things she told him, like her love for lilacs, favorite colors, etc. Now, his wife found out and is upset, feeling like it's a \"playbook\" and that he's being insincere, leading to her feeling betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author says he did it out of love, to remember the things he cares about. He didn't want to forget the details that make his wife special. That sounds genuine. But his wife interprets it as a manipulative tactic\u2014a playbook to game their relationship, which makes her feel like he's not being authentic.\n\nThe key here is the perspective of the wife. Even if his intentions are good, if she feels like it's a betrayal, then there's a problem. The question is whether the action itself is wrong, regardless of intent. Maybe keeping a secret like that, even with good intentions, can be seen as a breach of trust because he didn't share this with her. She didn't know about the Almanac and now feels like he's been keeping secrets. That could be a valid reason for her to feel hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that taking notes to remember things is a thoughtful gesture. Many people use methods to remember important details about their partners. The problem here is the wife's reaction, which could stem from her feelings about privacy or the way he kept it hidden. If he had mentioned it to her before, maybe she wouldn't have reacted this way.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of his actions, but the fact that he kept it a secret and she found out in a negative way might be the issue. The question is whether the action (keeping the Almanac) is inherently wrong or if the wrongness comes from the consequences and the wife's feelings. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, it's often about considering both sides. The wife's feelings are valid, and if the Almanac made her feel like her husband was using a script rather than being genuine, that's a problem. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but his actions led to her feeling betrayed. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he's also not entirely right because he didn't consider how she might feel about it. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and his intentions were pure, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. But some might say that keeping such a private record without her knowledge is inconsiderate, making him at least partially responsible. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he acted out of love and had no malicious intent. However, he should have considered her perspective and maybe discussed it with her. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is probably B.\n"
