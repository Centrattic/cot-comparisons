She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been keeping a notebook with details about his wife's preferences and stuff, and now she's upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. He's hurt because he thought it was a way to show his love and remember important things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember his wife's favorite things to do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But the wife is hurt. Why? Maybe she felt like he wasn't genuine, that he was just using the notes as a strategy to impress her, rather than remembering things naturally. She might have felt that he wasn't truly paying attention, or that he was keeping a list for his own benefit, not because he genuinely remembered from their relationship.\n\nBut then again, the husband argues that he's doing it to not forget and to show his love. He's worried about being the \"guy who doesn't remember anything.\" The question is whether his method of keeping a notebook is wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Privacy, trust, intentions vs. perception. The husband didn't hide the notebook, it had the name on the cover, but he didn't mention it. The wife found it, leading to her feeling betrayed. Maybe she felt that he should have been more open about it? Or that the act of keeping a notebook for her personal details is invasive or manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. If he had never mentioned the notebook, maybe she felt it was a secret, even if his intention was good. The fact that he kept it to himself might have made her feel like he's been keeping track in a way that's not authentic. Maybe she wanted him to remember things from their shared experiences naturally, rather than from a list.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that his actions were thoughtful and that her reaction is unfounded. But the key here is that she's hurt and feels betrayed. The husband's intentions are good, but the outcome is negative. So the question is whether the action itself is wrong, regardless of intention.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on how the action affects the other person, not just the intent. If the wife feels that the playbook cheapens their interactions, then from her perspective, the action is wrong. The husband might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action could be considered wrong because it caused emotional harm without her consent or understanding.\n\nSo, considering the wife's feelings and the impact of the action, even if the husband's intention was good, the act of keeping the notebook without discussing it might be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), because the action led to her feeling betrayed and it's not just about the intention but the effect.\n"
