She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having an almanac where they wrote down personal details about their wife. \n\nFirst, the context: The husband started writing down things his wife told him about her preferences (like her love for lilacs) because he wanted to remember them and do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone and kept it private. Now, his wife found it, and she feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapens his gestures. The husband is upset because he thought it was a way to show his love and remember important things.\n\nThe user thinks the husband isn't in the wrong. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, keeping a notebook of personal details might seem like a genuine effort to remember and care. But the wife's reaction is significant here. She felt her privacy was invaded, that he was using the information as a script. Even if the intent was good, the outcome caused her emotional distress. The key points are intent vs. impact. The husband's intent was to show love, but the wife's perception was that he was treating her like a project. \n\nHowever, the husband didn't share the almanac with anyone, and the wife found it. She might have felt that by keeping track, he was reducing her to a list of traits, making her feel objectified. The husband's actions, though well-meaning, might have crossed a boundary without his knowledge. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the husband had good intentions, the fact that the wife was upset by the existence of the notebook suggests that maybe he should have discussed it with her. Maybe she would have preferred him to remember things naturally rather than having them written down. \n\nBut the husband didn't do anything malicious. He was trying to be thoughtful. The wife's reaction might be more about how she felt about his methods rather than the act of taking notes itself. However, if the notebook made her feel like her partner was using her preferences for effect, that's a valid feeling. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit gray. If the wife felt betrayed, then yes, the impact is there. But the husband's intention was positive. However, in relationships, respecting each other's feelings is crucial. If a partner is upset by something you did, even with good intentions, you might need to consider if you were in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions were private and meant to be loving. The wife's reaction is more about her interpretation. The answer could lean either way. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering that his actions, though well-intentioned, caused hurt, maybe he's not in the wrong because he didn't have bad intent. But some might argue that the method (keeping a \"playbook\") is manipulative, even if unintended. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both intent and impact. If the wife feels betrayed and the husband didn't realize it would cause that, it's a communication issue. The husband isn't in the wrong for the act itself, but maybe for not discussing it. However, since he didn't share it, it's more about perception. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband's intent was positive, even if the wife felt hurt. But maybe others might say A because the method was problematic. But given the context, the user's initial thought aligns with B.\n"
