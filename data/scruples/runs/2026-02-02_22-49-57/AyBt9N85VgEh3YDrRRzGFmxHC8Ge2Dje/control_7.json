She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of his wife's preferences. Hmm. The story is about a guy who started writing down details about his wife's likes and stuff he wants to remember, like her favorite color, restaurants, etc. He did this to remember things and do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she was upset, called it a playbook, and felt betrayed. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author's intention was to remember things because he wanted to show he cared. He didn't share it with anyone, and the wife's reaction was unexpected. She felt that this almanac cheapened his gestures and made her feel like he was just using it as a list instead of remembering from the heart.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, keeping a list to remember things about his wife seems like a good intention. But maybe the issue is about privacy and consent. Did he have the right to keep such a detailed record without her knowledge? Even if it was well-meaning, she might have felt that having all those personal details written down was invasive, even if he didn't show it to others.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes people appreciate being remembered for who they are, not knowing that the other person is keeping track. If he's using a list, maybe she feels like he's not truly remembering but just referencing a list, making his gestures less genuine. But that's a bit of a stretch. However, the way he did it was to remember, not to manipulate. \n\nBut the problem is more about her feelings. The author didn't do anything malicious, but he didn't consider her perspective. Maybe he should have discussed it with her or not kept it as a secret. If she found out and felt betrayed, it's because he kept it hidden. The fact that he didn't share it with anyone might be why she felt it was a \"playbook\" instead of genuine effort. So the issue is about transparency and mutual understanding in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, sometimes actions that are meant to be kind can be perceived differently. The author's intention was good, but the wife's reaction highlights a lack of communication. He might not be in the wrong because his actions were well-intended, but he might need to better communicate his actions in the future. However, if she feels betrayed, maybe he did cross a line by keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge. \n\nBut I think in this case, the answer is more likely that he's not in the wrong (B). The problem is more about their communication and how she interpreted his actions. He did it out of love and care, and the issue is her perception, not necessarily his actions. Unless there was a breach of trust in how he handled the information, but since he never showed it to anyone, the fault isn't on him. The answer is B.\n"
