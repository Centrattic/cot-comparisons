She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping an Almanac, which is a notebook with notes about his wife's preferences and stuff. The main issue is that the wife found the notebook, felt betrayed, and now thinks it's a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine expression of love.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's intention was to remember important details about his wife because he wanted to show his love and be considerate. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. The act of taking notes seems like a personal way to manage information, especially for someone who might not remember all the details. The wife's reaction is about feeling that the notes were used as a tool rather than remembering being part of the love itself. She might feel that the notes reduce her to a list, making her feel like an object. \n\nBut why would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity or the authenticity of remembering things naturally. If he's relying on the notebook to do things for her, she might think he isn't truly present in the relationship. However, the author's intention was good; he wanted to avoid being the guy who forgets. The problem arises from the wife's perspective, not necessarily the action itself. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the action of keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. However, perhaps he should have considered how she might perceive it. But since he didn't know she'd take it that way, was he wrong to keep it? It's a communication issue. The author didn't have bad intentions, but maybe he didn't consider the emotional impact. The question is whether the action itself was wrong, not the lack of communication. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes the way we express love can conflict with the partner's expectations. The author's method of showing love through the notebook is valid, but the wife's feeling of betrayal is her valid reaction. So, it's a matter of differing values. The author isn't in the wrong because he had good intentions and the notebook was meant to help, not to deceive. The wife's reaction is her own perspective, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
