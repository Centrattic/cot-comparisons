She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with personal notes about his wife. The situation is that he started writing down things she told him, like her favorite things, to remember them because he didn't want to forget. Now his wife found out, and she's upset, feeling betrayed, thinking it's a playbook. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good; he wanted to remember important details about his wife to show his love and be attentive. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. The wife, on the other hand, feels like the almanac cheapens the gestures and is a betrayal. Maybe she felt like he was using it manipulatively, or that he wasn't being genuine because he's relying on notes instead of remembering naturally. Or perhaps she felt that keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge was an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut his actions were from a place of wanting to be a better partner. He didn't use the almanac to manipulate or control; he just wanted to remember her preferences. The key point is whether the act of keeping track of these things without her consent was wrong. In relationships, trust and communication are important. If he had discussed this with her before, maybe she would have understood. But he didn't realize that it could make her uncomfortable. \n\nAnother angle is that the wife might feel that the almanac makes her feel objectified, like she's being cataloged for someone else's benefit. However, the author's intent was to cherish her, not to objectify. The problem might be a communication breakdown. He didn't consider that she might have different feelings about this practice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, his actions were not malicious. He had good intentions but didn't consider her perspective. The fault might be more on his lack of communication rather than the act itself. However, since the wife is hurt and feels betrayed, even if unintentionally, the author might need to take responsibility for not discussing his actions with her beforehand. But whether that makes him \"in the wrong\" is debatable. \n\nIn some contexts, keeping notes like that is a common way for people to remember important details. However, the perception here is that the wife found it unsettling. It's possible that the method of using an almanac as a \"playbook\" made her feel like he's scripting their interactions, which could be seen as insincere. If the gestures felt mechanical, she might feel they're not heartfelt. \n\nBut again, the author's intention was to show love, not to script interactions. The problem is more about the wife's feelings and their communication. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the action itself is inherently wrong or if it's a matter of differing perspectives. Since the author didn't have ill intent and the wife's reaction is based on her feelings, it's a situation where both could be seen as having valid points. However, the author might need to adjust his approach to respect her feelings moving forward. \n\nGiven that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his intentions were good, and he didn't act with malice. The issue is more about their communication and differing views on what constitutes a genuine gesture.\n"
