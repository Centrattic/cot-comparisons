She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac with personal notes about his wife. The situation is that he's been writing down details about her preferences and things she mentioned, and she found it, feeling betrayed and called it a \"playbook.\" He's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. First, I need to break down the key points. The author started the almanac to remember her preferences because he didn't want to forget them. He used it to do sweet things for her, and he didn't share it with anyone. But when his wife found out, she felt it was inauthentic, like he was using a script. She felt cheapened by his gestures because she thought he wasn't genuinely remembering on his own. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about intention vs. perception. The author's intention was to remember and show love, but his wife perceived it as insincere. Now, is he at fault? Well, did he do anything wrong by keeping these notes? I don't think he intended to deceive. He was trying to be thoughtful. However, maybe the problem is that he didn't consider how she might feel about the method. She might value spontaneity or genuine memory without needing prompts. \n\nBut wait, is keeping notes inherently wrong? If he's trying to be attentive and remember things, that's a good thing. But perhaps the wife felt that the notes made his actions feel less personal or like he wasn't truly paying attention. The question is whether the method of remembering is what matters. \n\nSome might argue that the almanac is a private way to stay organized, and it's not wrong. Others might say that if he's using it as a list to go through, it could come off as mechanical. But the author didn't show it to anyone, and he used it to do nice things. The wife's reaction is emotional, but does that mean he's at fault? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is about not discussing it with her beforehand. If he had shared his approach, maybe she would have appreciated it. But he didn't, and now she feels betrayed because he kept it secret. However, keeping personal notes about a spouse isn't inherently deceitful unless it's done with malicious intent. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the wife had preferences about how he remembers things, maybe she should have expressed that earlier. But the author's intention was good. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. The problem is more about their differing perspectives on what makes a gesture genuine. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to be thoughtful and organized, and while the wife's feelings are valid, the act of keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. The issue is more about their communication and differing expectations.\n"
