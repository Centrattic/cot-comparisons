She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a guy who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down details about his wife's preferences and likes. His wife found it and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapened his gestures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author says he wrote things down because he wanted to remember important details about his wife, not to manipulate or use it against her. He kept it a secret, not showing anyone. His intention was to show he cared by remembering her favorite things. But when his wife found out, she felt like he was using it as a strategy, which made her uncomfortable.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. Intention vs. perception. The author's intention is pure\u2014he wanted to remember things to make her happy. However, the wife's perception is that he's treating her like a project, using a playbook, which can feel inauthentic. Even if his intentions are good, if the action caused hurt, does that make him wrong?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The wife might have felt that keeping the notebook a secret was a lack of transparency. Maybe she wanted to feel that he remembered things naturally without needing a list. The fact that he didn't tell her about the notebook could be a point\u2014maybe if he had shared it with her earlier, she wouldn't have felt that way. But he didn't mean to do anything wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the notebook itself isn't inherently wrong. People have different ways of showing love. Some might see it as thoughtful, others as calculating. The issue is the emotional impact. The wife is upset, so even if the author didn't mean to, he caused hurt. That might make him responsible, but not necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In AITA contexts, often the focus is on whether the action was harmful and if there was malicious intent. If there's no malicious intent, sometimes the answer is \"No,\" but if the action caused harm, there might be some responsibility to address it. The author needs to acknowledge her feelings and maybe adjust his approach without the notebook, but that doesn't mean he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No), because his intentions were good, even if the action led to her feeling hurt. The problem isn't the notebook itself but how she perceived it. He's not in the wrong for trying to remember, but he should address her feelings and maybe find another way to show his care without the notebook.\n"
