She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author started keeping an almanac of personal details about his wife, like her favorite things and memories, to remember them and do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. Then his wife found it, got upset, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's intention seems good. He wanted to remember things about his wife because he cares. The almanac started as a way to not forget the little things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs. That seems thoughtful. But when she found out, she felt it cheapened the gestures and felt like it was a playbook. She's upset and maybe feels like he's treating their relationship like something scripted. \n\nNow, why might the author be in the wrong? Maybe he didn't consider her feelings about being cataloged. Even if his intent was good, keeping track of her preferences in such a detailed way could make her feel objectified or like he's not truly present in the relationship. She might prefer that he remembers things naturally rather than from a list. Also, the fact that he kept it a secret could be an issue. If he didn't discuss it with her before, maybe he should have. Trust and communication are important in relationships, and keeping something like that hidden might break that trust, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have any malicious intent. He was trying to be a good husband by remembering things. The almanac was a personal project to help him stay connected to her. But the problem is that the wife's reaction shows that she has different feelings about it. Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine effort over planned gestures. So, while the author's actions were well-meaning, he might have overlooked how she would perceive it. \n\nAnother angle is that the almanac itself isn't inherently wrong, but the lack of communication about it could be. If the author had shared his intentions with her, maybe she would have a different view. The fact that she felt betrayed suggests that she saw it as something manipulative or controlling. Even though that wasn't the case, her perception is important here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are intentions versus impact. The author intended to show love and care, but the impact was hurtful. In relationships, both intent and impact matter. If the wife feels deeply wronged, even with good intentions, the author might need to take responsibility for not considering her feelings. But if he didn't have any malicious intent, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that keeping it secret and then causing her distress might make him at least partially responsible. \n\nI think the answer depends on how much the author should have anticipated her feelings. Since he didn't know she'd react this way, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the act of keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge could be seen as intrusive, then he might be. The question is whether keeping a private notebook of personal details, even with good intentions, crosses a line. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were good, the impact of his actions hurt his wife. He might not be in the wrong in terms of malicious intent, but he is responsible for not considering her perspective. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because the impact was negative, but maybe B (not in the wrong) because the intent was good. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't mean to harm, but did cause harm, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in relationships, actions that unintentionally hurt are still the responsibility of the person taking those actions. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
