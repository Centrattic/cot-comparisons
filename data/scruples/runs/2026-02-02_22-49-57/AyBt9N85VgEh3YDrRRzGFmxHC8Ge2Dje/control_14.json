She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with notes about his wife. Let me read through the story again.\n\nThe author started writing down details about his wife after their first date because he wanted to remember things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs. He did this in a notebook called \"The Almanac.\" Over the years, he added more details about her preferences. He used it to remember things so he could do sweet things for her. But then his wife found it, and she's upset. She feels like it's a \"playbook\" and that it cheapens his gestures. She's dejected and might destroy it. The author is heartbroken and thinks he's doing it out of love, not for brownie points.\n\nSo the question is whether he's at fault. From his perspective, he's trying to remember important things about his wife because he cares. He didn't share it with anyone, and he used it to be thoughtful. But his wife's reaction is that it feels inauthentic or like he's using a script. \n\nIn relationships, intentions matter, but also how actions are perceived. Even if his intention was good, the wife's feelings are valid. Maybe she felt that keeping track of these things made him seem like he wasn't naturally attentive, or that he's calculating. Some might argue that the act of writing things down is just a tool for remembering, but others might see it as insincere. \n\nI think the key here is that the wife's feelings are hurt, and the author needs to consider why she feels that way. It's possible she wanted him to remember things because he genuinely remembered them, not because he wrote them down. The fact that she's upset suggests that the method he used made her uncomfortable. \n\nBut is he wrong? Well, he didn't have bad intentions. However, actions have consequences. If the way he's using the notes makes her feel like he's not being authentic, then maybe he is at fault for not considering her feelings. The problem might be that he didn't realize that keeping such a detailed record could be seen as manipulative or inauthentic from her perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that taking notes is a reasonable way to remember important things about a spouse, especially for someone who might forget. The issue is more about perception and communication. If he hadn't mentioned it, maybe she wouldn't have found out. But now that she did, he needs to address her feelings. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the wife is the one feeling betrayed, the author might be at fault for not considering how she would perceive his actions. Even if his intention was good, the result was hurt feelings. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't take her feelings into account, even if he didn't mean to cause harm.\n"
