She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author met his wife in 2008, and since their first date, he started a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down all the little details about her preferences\u2014like her love for lilacs, favorite colors, restaurants, etc. He used this to remember things and do sweet gestures for her. Recently, his wife found the notebook and is upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. Now he's wondering if he did something wrong by having this almanac.\n\nSo the key question is: Is keeping a personal notebook of his wife's preferences and using it to remember things a betrayal or wrong action?\n\nFirst, think about the intention. The author's intention was good. He wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. The wife, on the other hand, found out and feels that it cheapens the sweet things he's done. She might feel that it's manipulative, like he's using a list to play up his love, rather than genuinely remembering from the heart. But he's just trying to remember, not to manipulate.\n\nBut why would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine effort, not something that feels rehearsed or scripted. If he's using a list, she might think it's not sincere. Even though his intention is good, her perception is important. The problem is that he didn't consider her perspective. Maybe he should have discussed it with her before keeping such a notebook. The act of compiling personal details might make her feel like he's reducing her to a list of preferences, which could be uncomfortable or even creepy, depending on the context. However, since it's about a spouse and the intention is affectionate, that's less likely. Still, the wife's reaction is valid. If she feels betrayed, even if the action was well-intentioned, it's a problem in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: privacy. The author kept the Almanac a secret. While he didn't share it with others, the fact that it's a secret might make her feel like there's something hidden. In relationships, transparency is important. If he had mentioned it before, maybe she wouldn't have reacted this way. But he didn't see it as anything to discuss. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the concept itself is an issue. Maybe she feels that by keeping track, it's not genuine love but a strategy to be a good husband, which could undermine her feelings.\n\nBut is the act of keeping notes inherently wrong? Many people use reminders or lists to remember important things, especially in a relationship. For example, remembering anniversaries, likes, dislikes. The wife might see it as a lack of natural effort. The difference here is that it's a comprehensive list. If he's using it to plan gestures, maybe she feels it's not sincere. Alternatively, she might think that he's not truly paying attention if he has to refer to a list.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the action was done in a way that respects the wife's feelings. The author didn't consider her perspective and kept it secret. The wife's feeling of betrayal is valid, even if the intention was good. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings and keeping it a secret. But on the other hand, the action itself is a loving effort. The problem is the lack of communication and her interpretation of the gesture.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's mistake was keeping the Almanac a secret and not discussing it with his wife. His intention was good, but the way it was handled caused hurt feelings. So, he's partially at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his wife's perspective and the secrecy might have contributed to her feeling betrayed.\n"
