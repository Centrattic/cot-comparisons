She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The situation is that he started keeping a notebook with details about his wife's preferences and memories to remember them, which he calls The Almanac. His wife found out and felt betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" that cheapens his gestures. The author is confused because he didn't share it with anyone and thought it was a sweet gesture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's trying to remember important things about his wife because he cares. He's taken the time to document these things so he doesn't forget, which is a positive intention. But his wife's reaction is about feeling like her personal details are being cataloged in a way that feels inauthentic or manipulative. She might see it as him using the notes as a strategy rather than genuinely remembering things from his heart. \n\nThe key points here are consent and perception. The husband didn't ask his wife if she was okay with him keeping track of these details. While his intention was good, the act of keeping a secret \"playbook\" could make her feel like he's treating their relationship like a script. Even if he meant it as a way to show love, the method might have crossed a line by not involving her in that process. Trust and transparency in a relationship are important, and keeping such a thing hidden could be seen as a breach of that trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that he was just trying to do something thoughtful. However, the wife's feelings are valid. If she feels that her personal information is being used in a way that's not genuine, it could lead to resentment. The fact that she found out and felt the need to take the book might indicate that she values her privacy and authenticity in the relationship. \n\nSo, while the husband's intentions were good, the execution might have been flawed. He didn't consider his wife's perspective on the matter. It's possible that he should have discussed the idea with her first to ensure that it was okay with her. Since he kept it a secret, and it caused her distress, he might be in the wrong for not being transparent and for not respecting her feelings about how her personal information is handled.\n"
