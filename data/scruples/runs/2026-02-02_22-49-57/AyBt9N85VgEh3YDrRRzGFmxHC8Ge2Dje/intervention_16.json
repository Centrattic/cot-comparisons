She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been keeping a notebook of his wife's preferences and little details he wants to remember. He uses it to do sweet things for her, but when she found out, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel like he was using it to manipulate or cheapen his gestures.\n\nHmm. First, the man's intention was good. He wanted to remember things about her because he loves her. He didn't share it with anyone, so it was private. But the issue is how she felt when she found out. She felt like it cheapened the sweet things he did. So maybe the problem isn't the act of keeping the notebook itself, but the fact that he didn't communicate this to her. Maybe she expected that the memories he had were spontaneous and sincere, and knowing he had a written playbook made her feel like it wasn't genuine.\n\nBut then again, he didn't have bad intentions. He did it out of love. But feelings can't be ignored here. She feels betrayed, so even if he was in the right, the situation is about their relationship dynamics. Maybe he should have talked to her about it, or maybe she's overreacting. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because the intent was right, but maybe he could have handled it better by discussing it with her. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he kept it a secret and she found out, maybe the secrecy is part of the problem. But the purpose was good. So is he in the wrong? Well, if the action (keeping the notes) itself was wrong, then no. But if the secrecy and not discussing it with her was wrong, maybe. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong for having the Almanac, not for not discussing it. \n\nThe key point is that she felt betrayed. Even if his intentions were good, her perception is important. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because his actions were well-intentioned, but he needs to address her feelings. But the options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). Given that, I think B is the answer because the intent was positive, and the mistake might be in not communicating, not the act of having the notebook itself. So the answer is B.\n"
