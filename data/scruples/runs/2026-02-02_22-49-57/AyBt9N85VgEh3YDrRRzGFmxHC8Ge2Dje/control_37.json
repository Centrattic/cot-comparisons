She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac with personal notes about his wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The man started taking notes about his wife's preferences, like her love for lilacs, favorite colors, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. This was over many years, and he never showed anyone. Then, when she found it, she was upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. Now he's worried about her destroying it and getting the silent treatment.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intention was to remember important details about his wife because he loves her. He didn't mean to make it seem like he's keeping track for some ulterior motive. However, his wife feels that having an Almanac makes the sweet gestures feel manipulative. She might feel like he's not paying genuine attention, but instead using a list to score points.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, actions have consequences. Even if his intention was good, the result is that his wife is hurt. The problem might be that he didn't consider how she might perceive the Almanac. In relationships, communication is key. He didn't discuss this with her, maybe assuming she'd understand his reasoning. But she didn't, and now it's causing tension.\n\nOn the other hand, he was trying to be thoughtful and remember things. Keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. But maybe the issue is that it made her feel objectified or that her personal details were being cataloged for his benefit rather than her own expression. It's a bit of a gray area, but since his wife is clearly upset and feels betrayed, the author might need to take responsibility for not considering her feelings here. He's not malicious, but perhaps he overlooked her emotional needs in this instance.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because even though his intent was good, the action caused hurt and he didn't consider her perspective. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the intention is the main factor. But usually, in such situations, the impact on the other person matters more. So leaning towards A.\n"
