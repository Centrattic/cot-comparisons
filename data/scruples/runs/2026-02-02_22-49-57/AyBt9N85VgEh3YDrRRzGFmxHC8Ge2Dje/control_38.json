She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac where he writes down details about his wife. The situation is that he keeps track of her preferences and uses it to do sweet things for her. But his wife found out and is upset, thinking it's a \"playbook\" and feels cheapened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author says he did it out of love, to remember things and not be the guy who forgets. His actions were meant to be thoughtful. But his wife's reaction is about feeling like he's using a script, which might make her feel that his gestures are insincere.\n\nThe key points here are consent and transparency. Did he keep this secret because he didn't want to share his method, or did he think it was a private way to show love? The wife wasn't aware of the almanac, so her feeling of betrayal could come from the secrecy. Even if his intentions were good, keeping such a personal tool hidden might have led to misunderstandings.\n\nAnother angle is whether the act of documenting her preferences in a list, even with good intentions, could be seen as objectifying or reducing her to a list of traits. The wife might feel that her personal details are being cataloged for his benefit rather than being genuinely present in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author didn't share it with anyone else, so it was a personal effort to remember. The issue here is more about the wife's perspective. The author didn't lie, but the act of keeping it secret without her knowledge might have caused her to feel that her personal information was being used without her consent, even if it was for a positive purpose.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the author had shared his method earlier, maybe the wife would have appreciated the effort. But since she found out unexpectedly, it's understandable she feels betrayed. The problem isn't the almanac itself, but the lack of transparency. So while his intentions were good, the action of keeping it hidden might be what's wrong here.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because the secrecy and lack of communication led to her feeling betrayed, even if his intentions were loving. But others might argue that his actions were harmless and the wife is overreacting. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key issue is the breach of trust due to not discussing it with her.\n"
