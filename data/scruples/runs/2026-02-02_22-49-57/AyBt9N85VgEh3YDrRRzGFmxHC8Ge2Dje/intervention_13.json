She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with notes about his wife's preferences. The author created this almanac to remember things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to do sweet things for her. His wife found it and feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and cheapening the gestures.\n\nHmm. So the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's break it down. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private, and used it to make her happy. But his wife's reaction is that it feels manipulative, like he's using a playbook instead of genuinely remembering. \n\nWhy would she feel that way? Maybe she felt like the gestures became insincere because they were planned using notes. People sometimes value spontaneous acts of love more than planned ones. If she thought he was just following a list, it might make her feel like he's not truly present or attentive. Also, the term \"playbook\" suggests that he has a strategy, which could imply he's not being genuine. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to show love and care by remembering details. He didn't mean to make it seem like a strategy. The fact that he kept it private and used it for good reasons might mean he's not in the wrong. However, maybe he should have considered her perspective. If she felt betrayed, even if the intention was good, the action caused hurt. \n\nIs there a lack of communication here? The author didn't explain his reasoning to her until she confronted him. Perhaps he should have shared his motives earlier to avoid misunderstanding. But the wife's reaction seems harsh, given that the almanac was meant to help him remember things he might otherwise forget. \n\nSo the question is whether the author's action, though well-intentioned, crossed a boundary. If the wife feels that the gestures became mechanical or that he's not truly attentive, then maybe the author didn't consider her feelings. But if the author's actions were purely to express love and the wife is overreacting, then he's not at fault. \n\nI think the key is whether the act of having a written list undermines the sincerity of his gestures. If the wife perceives it that way, the author might not be in the wrong, but he might need to address her feelings. Since the wife's reaction is based on feeling cheapened, maybe the problem is her perspective rather than his action. But some might argue that keeping a list, regardless of intent, could be seen as manipulative. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent versus impact. The impact here is negative, but the intent was positive. If the author didn't know his actions would cause hurt, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the action itself (keeping a list) is inherently problematic, then maybe he is. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intention was good and the action was meant to show love, but the wife's feelings are valid. The problem might be a communication gap rather than the author being wrong.\n"
