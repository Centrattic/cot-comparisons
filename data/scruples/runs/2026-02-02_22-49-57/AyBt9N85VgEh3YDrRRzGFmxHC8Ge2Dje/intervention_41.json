She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves him keeping an almanac with notes about his wife's preferences and details. He wrote them down because he wanted to remember things to do sweet things for her. His wife found out, felt betrayed, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love and avoid being the forgetful partner. He didn't share it with anyone, so maybe he thought it was a private way to express his affection. But his wife took it as a playbook, implying that he was calculating or not genuine in his gestures. She might feel that he's not truly present or spontaneous in his love, but instead relying on a list. That could make her feel used or like his love isn't sincere.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping notes is a common way people organize information, especially for someone who wants to remember details. It's not inherently deceitful. The problem here is the wife's perception. The key issue might be about privacy and trust. Did the author keep this a secret for a reason? The wife might have felt that if he valued her so much, he shouldn't need to write it down. There's also the aspect of communication\u2014maybe they didn't talk about his need to take notes, so she didn't understand the intent behind it.\n\nAnother angle is that the wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed. The term \"playbook\" suggests she thinks he's strategizing his actions to impress her, which could undermine her trust. But if his intention was pure, maybe he should have explained it to her earlier. The fact that he didn't mention it before might contribute to her hurt feelings because she only found out when she discovered the book. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. His actions were well-meaning, but perhaps he didn't consider how his wife might perceive it. The secrecy around the almanac might be an issue. If he had told her about it earlier, she might have appreciated the effort. Now that she's hurt, it's about how he handles the situation going forward. The question is whether his actions themselves (keeping notes) are wrong or if it's more about communication. Since the act of taking notes isn't inherently wrong, but the wife's feelings are valid, maybe the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong but needing to address the communication gap. So, answer B.\n"
