She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife. The situation is that he started taking notes to remember important things about her, like her favorite things, and used these notes to do sweet things for her. Now, when she found out, she felt betrayed and called it a playbook, which made her feel like he was just using a script instead of genuinely remembering things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was good\u2014trying to remember details to be a better partner. He didn't share it with anyone and didn't mean to hurt her. On the other hand, the wife felt that having a written list made the gestures feel insincere. She might have felt like he wasn't truly paying attention or that he was using a strategy rather than being spontaneous.\n\nIs keeping such a list inherently wrong? Well, the author did it to be thoughtful, not to manipulate. The problem here might be more about communication. Maybe the wife didn't realize that he was doing this to be attentive. Or perhaps she felt that relying on a notebook meant he wasn't trying hard enough. But then again, everyone has different ways of showing love. Some people remember things naturally, others need to write them down. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's reaction is valid. If she interprets the almanac as a playbook, then maybe there's a misunderstanding about his intentions. He needs to explain that it's a tool for genuine love, not a script. But does that make him wrong? Or is he just using a method that she doesn't understand yet?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, intentions matter. The author's actions were to be a better husband, which is a positive intent. However, the outcome was negative because of how she perceived it. But is the author at fault for not foreseeing her reaction? Maybe not. Unless he had prior discussions about this, it's hard to say he's wrong. The key issue might be about transparency and communication. He didn't hide it before, but maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier. But since he didn't mean to hurt her and the action itself is benign, he's probably not in the wrong. The problem is more about their communication styles and differing perceptions of love languages. She might value spontaneous gestures more, while he uses a practical method. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
