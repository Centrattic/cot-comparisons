She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author met his wife, started taking notes on her preferences as a way to remember important things she told him. He did this because he wanted to be a considerate partner. The Almanac was a private notebook he used to keep track of her favorite things, so he could do sweet things for her. It was a secret, and he never showed it to anyone. But when his wife found it, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel like every gesture was calculated. Now she's upset and considering destroying it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the intent versus the effect. The author's intention was to show love and care by remembering things, which is a good motive. However, the way it was done might have been intrusive. Even though he didn't intend to make her feel like he was just using a list, his wife perceived it that way. She might have felt that his actions were insincere because he was relying on notes rather than genuinely remembering. \n\nBut wait, he was trying to remember! People have different ways of showing love. Some might feel that writing things down is a way to be thoughtful, while others might see it as a lack of natural memory or effort. The wife's reaction is based on her feelings of being manipulated or treated as an object to be \"scored.\" \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on whether keeping the Almanac was a breach of trust or privacy. Since he didn't share it with anyone and used it for good intentions, maybe not. But she felt betrayed, which is a valid emotion. The problem might be that he didn't consider her perspective on the matter. Maybe he should have discussed his approach with her instead of keeping it secret. However, the act of taking notes in itself isn't inherently wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if she didn't know about it and found out later, she might feel that her personal information was documented without her consent. That could be a privacy issue. But since it's about her own preferences, perhaps not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the impact on others. Even if the motive is good, if it hurts someone, it's a problem. The wife's hurt feelings are significant here. However, the author's approach was to be caring. It's possible that the wife's reaction is more about feeling objectified rather than the act of note-taking itself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think maybe not, because his intentions were good, but he might have failed to anticipate how she would feel. The answer might hinge on whether intent or effect is more important. In relationships, sometimes actions that come from good intentions can still be problematic if they don't consider the other person's feelings. However, the actual act of keeping the notes isn't necessarily wrong. The issue is more about communication and understanding each other's perspectives. \n\nTherefore, I'd lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he needs to address her feelings and find a way to meet her needs as well.\n"
