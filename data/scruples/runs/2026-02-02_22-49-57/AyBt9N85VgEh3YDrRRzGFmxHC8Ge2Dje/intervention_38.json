She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with notes about his wife. The story is from AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, so it's a real-life scenario presented there. The husband created a personal journal with details about his wife's preferences and memories, which he uses to remember things and do sweet gestures. His wife found it, got upset, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband's intention was to remember important things about his wife and use them to show his love. He didn't keep it from her intentionally; he just kept it private. The wife's reaction is about feeling like the almanac is a \"playbook\" and that it cheapens his gestures. She feels betrayed, even though he never showed it to anyone else. \n\nIs there a breach of trust here? The husband kept the almanac secret, but it's for a good reason. He didn't hide it maliciously; he just wanted to have these notes for himself. The wife might see it as manipulative, using notes instead of genuinely remembering, which could make her feel like he's not being sincere. On the other hand, the husband is trying to be thoughtful by keeping track of things he might otherwise forget.\n\nThe key points are the wife's feelings versus the husband's intentions. The husband didn't lie about the almanac's existence, but he did keep it private. The wife's reaction is emotional, but is the husband at fault? In relationships, transparency is important. If the husband had shared his almanac earlier, maybe the wife would have understood his intentions. However, since he kept it a secret, even for good reasons, the wife might feel he wasn't being open with her.\n\nBut the husband's actions were meant to be caring. He's trying to remember important things, which is a positive trait. However, the method of using a written playbook might make the wife feel that his gestures are insincere. The problem here is more about perception and communication rather than a clear right or wrong. \n\nIn AITA cases, the community often considers both sides. The husband's intention is good, but the wife's feelings are valid. The husband might not be in the wrong for creating the almanac, but he might need to address the communication gap. Since the wife is upset about the secrecy and the nature of the playbook, even if the intentions were good, the result is that she feels betrayed. So, maybe the answer isn't a simple A or B. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B. \n\nConsidering that the husband didn't act with malice, just with good intentions that backfired due to lack of communication, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that keeping such a personal document without discussing it with his partner is an issue. It's a grey area. However, since the husband's actions were well-meaning and there's no evidence of deceit beyond keeping it private, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But others might see it as A because the secrecy caused hurt feelings. It's tricky. The community might split, but given the context, the husband's intentions are positive, so B is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
