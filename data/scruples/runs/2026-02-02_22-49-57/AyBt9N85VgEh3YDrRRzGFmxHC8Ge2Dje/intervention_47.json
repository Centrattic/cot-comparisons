She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac where they wrote down personal information about their wife. The author created this almanac to remember important details about her, like her favorite things, and used it to do sweet things for her. But now the wife is upset, feeling that the almanac cheapens the gestures and feels like a playbook, making her feel betrayed.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: was keeping the almanac a breach of trust or privacy? The author didn't show it to anyone and kept it secret. The wife found out and is hurt because she expected the author to remember things naturally rather than relying on notes. The author's intention was genuine, to remember and be thoughtful, but the method caused her to feel like it's insincere.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author had good intentions, trying to be a better partner. On the other, the wife might feel that the notes make the gestures feel calculated instead of heartfelt. Trust is important here. If the author didn't share the almanac with anyone, maybe it's their own personal tool, but the wife's feelings are valid. The author might be in the wrong if the act of keeping such a detailed record without discussing it with the wife was a breach of trust. However, the wife didn't know about it, so maybe it's not about secrecy but about the underlying implication that the husband can't remember things genuinely.\n\nAnother angle: does the wife have a reasonable expectation that the husband should remember things without notes? People have different methods. Some take notes, others rely on memory. But if the wife values spontaneity and natural remembrance, the notes might feel like a crutch. The husband didn't intend to deceive, but the effect was hurtful. Maybe the issue isn't the almanac itself but the wife's perception of it as a playbook rather than a genuine effort.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was not malicious. He kept it private and used it to be thoughtful. However, the wife's feelings are valid. The author might be in the right in terms of intent but in the wrong in how it affected the wife. The question is whether keeping the almanac is inherently wrong or if the problem is in the wife's reaction. Since the author didn't use it in a harmful way, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the wife's feelings are important. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's intentions were good, so probably not in the wrong.\n"
