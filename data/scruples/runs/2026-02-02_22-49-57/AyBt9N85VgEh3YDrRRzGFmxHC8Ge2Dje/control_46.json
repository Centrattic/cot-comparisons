She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by having an almanac of notes about their wife. The situation is that the wife found out about the notebook and feels betrayed, thinking it's a playbook, which makes her feel like the sweet gestures aren't genuine. The author's intention was to remember important details about his wife to show his love and avoid being forgetful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's perspective is that taking notes is a personal way to remember things, done in good faith to be a better partner. He didn't share it with anyone, so he didn't mean to hurt her. On the other hand, the wife's reaction is emotional; she feels that the notes cheapen the gestures and that it's a playbook, implying insincerity. She might feel that the effort should come naturally without being documented, or that keeping such a notebook is a form of control or manipulation.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife's reaction suggests that the act of keeping detailed notes made her uncomfortable, possibly because she felt her personal details were being cataloged without her consent. Even if the intention was good, the method might have been a privacy issue. The author might not have considered how she would react if she found out. The fact that she called it a playbook implies she sees it as a strategy rather than genuine affection, which can lead to feelings of being used or not loved authentically.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the outcome of the action caused hurt. The key here is whether the action (keeping the notebook) was appropriate without discussing it with her. Since relationships require mutual understanding, maybe the author should have talked about this practice earlier. However, the wife's reaction is also about her feeling that the gestures aren't sincere anymore, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nDetermining who is in the wrong here is tricky. The author's actions were with good intentions, but the wife's feelings are valid. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because the intention was positive, but he might need to address her feelings and find a compromise. Alternatively, if the wife felt that the act of keeping such notes was intrusive or manipulative, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's more about the action and its consequences. The answer might hinge on whether the action was a breach of trust or privacy, which it might not be, but it did cause emotional distress. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the responder's intent versus the impact. Here, the impact is significant, but the intent is good. However, in relationships, both must agree on what's acceptable. The author might not be in the wrong for having the notebook, but he should have discussed it with his wife earlier to ensure it doesn't make her uncomfortable. Since he didn't, and it caused hurt, maybe he's partially at fault. But the core question is whether he's in the wrong. If the act itself is neutral, then no. But if the act is seen as manipulative, then yes. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the intention was good, but the situation highlights a communication issue.\n"
