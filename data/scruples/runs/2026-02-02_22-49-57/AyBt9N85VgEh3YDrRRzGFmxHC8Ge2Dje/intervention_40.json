She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after creating an \"Almanac\" of details about his wife. The author kept it secret, never showed anyone, and used it to remember things she liked to do thoughtful things. Now his wife is upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's using it to manipulate or not truly remembering her.\n\nHmm. The wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed and cheapened. The key points here are intent and communication. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife. But the wife might see it as insincere because he's relying on notes instead of just remembering naturally. She might feel like he's treating her as a project or using a strategy, which could make her feel like he's not fully present or genuine.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't intend to do anything wrong. He thought it was a helpful way to remember, especially since he was young and not great with details. The fact that he kept it a secret could be part of the problem. If he had shared his method with her before, maybe she would have understood his intentions better. But now, her reaction is hurt and betrayal, which is significant.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not in terms of malicious intent. But perhaps he didn't consider how she might perceive it. The issue is that he didn't communicate his reasons to her. Even if his actions were well-meaning, not discussing it with her led to misunderstanding. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he handled the situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong now that it's caused a problem. The answer could depend on cultural or personal expectations. Some people might see taking notes as a genuine effort, others as a way to manipulate. The wife's feelings are valid, but the author's actions were from a place of wanting to be considerate. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication. Alternatively, maybe A, if the act of keeping the Almanac is seen as deceitful or manipulative. But given the context, I think the author's intent was good, so B makes more sense.\n"
