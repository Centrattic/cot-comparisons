She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author keeping an Almanac with notes about his wife's preferences and using it to remember details for thoughtful gestures. His wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook.\" The author feels he's in the right because he's trying to show love and care.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the perspectives. The author's intention was to remember things about his wife to make her feel loved. He kept it secret and only used it when he wanted to do sweet things for her. The wife, however, felt like it made his gestures seem insincere or manipulative. She might have felt that he wasn't genuinely remembering but was just using a list, which could make her feel like he's not truly present or spontaneous.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. Is keeping a list to remember a partner's preferences inherently wrong? Well, the author didn't use it to deceive or manipulate; he was trying to be a more attentive partner. The issue seems to be about the wife's feelings of being objectified or her gestures feeling like a script. But did the author overstep by keeping a private list? Maybe the problem is more about transparency and communication. The author didn't mention the list to her before, which might have been a mistake. If he had shared his intentions and how he uses the list, maybe she would have understood. However, keeping it secret and then using it without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intent was good.\n\nBut the wife's reaction is also valid. She might feel that her partner isn't truly present, that the acts come from a list rather than genuine connection. Even if the intention is good, the wife's feelings of betrayal suggest that the method might have crossed a line. The key here is whether the act of keeping the list and using it for gestures without her knowledge was a violation of trust or privacy. The author didn't share it because he didn't want to reveal his intentions, perhaps fearing judgment or making it seem like a tactic. But that secrecy might have led to misunderstandings.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's perception matters here. Even if the author's actions were well-meaning, if they caused significant distress, there's a case to be made that he's at fault because he didn't consider how she might perceive it. The author needs to address her feelings and maybe adjust his approach, but was he wrong to have the list in the first place? Maybe not, but the lack of communication was a problem. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since his intention was positive and there's no evidence of deceit beyond the secrecy of the list, it's possible he's not in the wrong. The wife's reaction might be about her own feelings rather than the list itself. So, the answer could depend on whether the secrecy and the method of using the list were the issues. If his actions were harmless in intention and the problem is her perception, then he's not in the wrong. But if the secrecy and the nature of the list were a violation, then he might be. Given that he didn't use it to manipulate or deceive, but to genuinely care, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong. However, the situation highlights a communication breakdown. So the answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
