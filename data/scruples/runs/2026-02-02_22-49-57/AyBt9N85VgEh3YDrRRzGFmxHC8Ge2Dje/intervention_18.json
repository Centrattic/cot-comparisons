She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who created an Almanac, a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife, like her favorite things. His wife found it and now feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and is upset because she thought he remembered things naturally.\n\nSo, the man's intention was to remember important details about his wife, which makes sense. He wanted to be a good partner by remembering her preferences. He kept it private, and only the wife knew about it. But when she found it, she was upset. The question is whether he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the man didn't do anything illegal or unethical. He was trying to be thoughtful. The issue here is more about the wife's feelings. She might feel that the existence of the Almanac implies he doesn't truly remember her things from the heart, but instead relies on notes, which could make her feel like she's being cataloged or that the gestures are insincere. On the other hand, the man's motivation was genuine; he wanted to remember because he cares.\n\nHe didn't share it with anyone, so there's no breach of privacy or secrecy on that end. The problem arises from the wife's perception. It's possible that she felt the Almanac was a tactic to seem attentive rather than showing genuine memory, which could make her feel used or like the gestures aren't sincere. The key here is communication. If he had discussed his feelings with her about why he keeps the notebook, maybe she would understand better. But he didn't, so now there's a misunderstanding.\n\nIn relationships, feelings matter a lot. Even if his intention was good, if his actions caused her emotional distress, then he might need to consider her feelings more. However, he didn't have bad intentions. It's a situation where both sides might have valid points. The wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed, which is valid even if the action itself isn't malicious. The man might not be in the wrong, but he might need to address her feelings to resolve the issue. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether intentions alone are enough. Since he didn't do anything wrong intentionally, but his actions caused hurt, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is likely that he isn't in the wrong (B), because there's no malicious intent and the action itself isn't unethical. The problem is more about the wife's interpretation and their communication issues.\n"
