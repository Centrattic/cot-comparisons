She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband, who's been in a relationship since 2008, started keeping an Almanac with details about his wife's preferences. He did this so he wouldn't forget important things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs. The problem is that when his wife found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine gesture of love.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember things to show his love and thoughtfulness. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. But the wife's reaction is that it's cheapening the sweet things he's done, making her feel like he's just using a list instead of being spontaneous or genuine.\n\nSo the key points here are the intentions vs. the impact. The husband didn't mean to make it seem like a playbook, but to him, it was a way to remember. However, the wife's feelings are valid because she felt her partner was keeping a list for the wrong reasons, maybe implying manipulation or lack of sincerity. The question is whether the husband's action, despite good intentions, was wrong because it hurt his wife's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is about trust and transparency. The wife didn't know about the Almanac until it was found. Even though he didn't tell anyone, hiding it might have made her feel like there's something he shouldn't have kept from her. Maybe she expected a more open approach to their relationship, where such a personal item wouldn't exist because he should remember things naturally.\n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" suggests she thinks he's following a script, which might undermine her feeling that his gestures are genuine. If he's relying on a list, maybe she feels he's not fully present or sincere in the moment. Even though he meant it as a way to remember, the perception is that he's using a strategy instead of being naturally attentive.\n\nBut the husband's argument is that he's trying to be a good partner by not forgetting things, which is admirable. Many people struggle with remembering details, so using a notebook as an aid might be seen as a positive. The issue is that the method backfired because it didn't convey the same meaning to his wife as he intended.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband didn't realize that his method of remembering might be perceived differently. Maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier to understand her perspective. But since he didn't know she'd mind, it's not necessarily his fault. However, the fact that it caused hurt feelings means he might need to adjust his approach.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the wife's feelings are valid and he should have considered how she might perceive it, then maybe he did something wrong by not communicating his intentions. But if his intentions were pure and he didn't realize the impact, it's more about misunderstanding rather than being wrong. It's tricky. The answer might depend on whether the action itself is wrong or if it's about miscommunication. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the wife's reaction is valid, the husband might be at fault for not considering her feelings, even if his intentions were good. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes). But some might argue it's not his fault since he had good intentions. However, in relationships, actions can be wrong if they hurt the partner regardless of intent. So the answer is A.\n"
