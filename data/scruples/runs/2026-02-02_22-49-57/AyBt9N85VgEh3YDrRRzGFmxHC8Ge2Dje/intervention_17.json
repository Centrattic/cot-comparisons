She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The situation is that he kept a notebook with all sorts of personal details about his wife, like her favorite things and stuff. He did this to remember them so he could do sweet things for her. But his wife found out and is upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's using it to manipulate her. She's hurt and hasn't decided if he can have it back.\n\nHmm. So the question is, is he wrong? Well, first, he started the Almanac with good intentions. He wanted to remember things because he loves her and didn't want to forget. That seems thoughtful. He didn't share it with anyone else, kept it private. But when his wife found out, she felt it was inauthentic or like he was using the information as a playbook, which made her feel betrayed. \n\nNow, from his perspective, he's confused and hurt because he didn't think of it that way. He thought it was a way to show love. But maybe she saw it as insincere. The key here is whether the intent was wrong. He had good intentions, but maybe the act of keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge could be seen as intrusive, even if it's well-meaning. However, he was using it to remember things she told him, not to manipulate. \n\nBut why is she upset? Maybe she felt that instead of just remembering naturally, he's relying on a list, which makes her wonder if he's being genuine. Or maybe she feels that he's treating her like a project to be managed, which could affect her self-esteem. It's possible that she wanted him to remember things because he truly cared, not because he had a system. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to remember important details about her, which shows he cares. The problem might be the method rather than the intent. If he had just remembered the things without writing them down, there wouldn't be an issue. But by writing it down, it's perceived as a strategy rather than genuine affection. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation here? Some people might see keeping such a list as sweet and thoughtful, while others might see it as inauthentic. The wife's reaction is valid because she's feeling hurt. The husband might need to understand her perspective better. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's not like he did something illegal or unethical. He kept it private, didn't share it. But his wife's feelings are important. Maybe the issue is about transparency. If he had told her about the Almanac earlier, maybe she wouldn't have felt surprised and betrayed. But he didn't, so her reaction is based on not knowing until now. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether intent versus action is the focus. If the action (keeping the Almanac) was done with good intent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the action caused harm without considering her feelings, maybe he is. \n\nI think the key here is that he didn't do it with malicious intent. He was trying to remember things to show love. The problem is the wife's perception. So the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he might need to address her feelings of betrayal. So answer B.\n"
