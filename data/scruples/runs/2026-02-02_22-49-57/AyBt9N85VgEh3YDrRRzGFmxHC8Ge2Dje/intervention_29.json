She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who created an almanac with details about his wife's preferences and personal information. He did this to remember important things about her and to do sweet things for her. However, when his wife discovered it, she felt betrayed and hurt, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling that it cheapened his gestures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was positive: he wanted to remember his wife's likes and show his love. He didn't share the almanac with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, the wife's reaction is about feeling that her personal information was documented in a way that made her uncomfortable. She might have felt that it was manipulative or that her privacy was invaded, even though the intent was good.\n\nThe key points here are consent and perception. The author didn't ask his wife if it was okay to keep track of her personal details. Even with good intentions, using someone's private information without their knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife's reaction suggests that the act of keeping such a detailed record made her feel objectified or that her husband was treating her as a project rather than a partner. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of privacy. Even if the information is things she shared with him, the compilation into a personal \"playbook\" might make her feel like he's using those details to control or manipulate her, even if that's not the case. The term \"playbook\" implies a strategy, which she might interpret as insincere efforts rather than genuine love.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that he's trying to be a better partner by remembering her preferences. He didn't misuse the information, and he felt it was a way to show his love. The problem arises from the lack of communication. If he had discussed his reasons with her beforehand, maybe she would have understood his intentions. \n\nThe question is whether the action itself is wrong regardless of intent. In relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are crucial. The author might not be in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he failed to consider how his wife might feel about it. It's a matter of differing expectations and boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were positive and there was no malicious intent. However, he should have communicated with his wife about why he was doing it to avoid misunderstandings. The wife's feelings are valid, but the author's actions don't necessarily make him the asshole; it's more about the lack of discussion rather than the act itself. Therefore, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
