She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife. The story is that he's been writing down personal details and preferences to remember them and do sweet things for her. His wife found out and feels betrayed, calling it a playbook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author's intention was to remember things he'd otherwise forget, to make his wife feel loved and appreciated. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. That seems well-meaning. But his wife took it as manipulative or inauthentic, like he's using a list to game the relationship. \n\nNow, the key points here are trust and communication. The author didn't think there was an issue with keeping the notes until his wife reacted. He might not have considered how she would perceive it. Even if his motives were good, the fact that she felt cheapened and betrayed means there's a problem. It's about her feelings and how the action affected their relationship. \n\nHe also mentions that she hasn't decided if he can have it back and might destroy it. That shows the tension in the relationship now. The question is whether the action itself was wrong, regardless of intent. In relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are important. If the wife feels that the notes implied insincerity, then the action, while well-intentioned, might be seen as wrong because it caused hurt and mistrust. \n\nBut then again, keeping notes isn't inherently manipulative. Many people use reminders for anniversaries, preferences, etc. The issue here is the wife's reaction. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but in the context of their relationship, her feelings of betrayal are valid. The problem might not be the act itself but the lack of communication about it. If he had discussed it with her beforehand, maybe she wouldn't have felt that way. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether keeping a private journal of notes is wrong. Since the author's intent was positive but the outcome was negative due to the wife's perception, it's possible he's not in the wrong, but he did make a mistake in not considering her perspective. However, some might argue that keeping a private record of personal details without discussing it can be seen as underhanded, even if the intent was good. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often weigh both sides. The author isn't doing anything malicious, but the impact on the wife is significant. So, maybe he's not in the wrong (B), because the intent was good, but he needs to address her feelings and find a way to reconcile. Alternatively, if the act itself is considered manipulative, then he is in the wrong (A). But given the common AITA responses, the community usually considers intent and context. Since his intent was to be loving, and the mistake was not anticipating her feelings, the answer might be B.\n"
