She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author has been keeping a notebook called The Almanac where he writes down details about his wife's preferences, like her favorite color, restaurants, books, etc. He does this so he can remember important things and do sweet things for her. He's kept it private, never showing it to anyone. Recently, his wife found it and feels betrayed, calling it her \"playbook\" and saying it cheapened his gestures. Now she's giving him the silent treatment and considering destroying it. The author is confused because he thought this showed his love and dedication, and he's heartbroken that she's upset.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider his intentions. He created the Almanac to remember important things about her, which he did out of love. He didn't share it with anyone, and the purpose was to make her feel appreciated. That seems genuine. But maybe the problem is the secrecy and the implication that he's using these notes to manipulate or script his gestures, making them seem inauthentic. \n\nHis wife's reaction is key here. She felt that having a \"playbook\" made his sweet gestures feel less genuine. It might have made her feel like he was only doing things to meet expectations or that his love was calculated rather than spontaneous. Even if his intentions were good, the result was making her feel used or that her personal details were being cataloged without her knowledge. \n\nPrivacy is another angle. He kept it all to himself, so she was blindsided when she found out. She might have appreciated being involved or knowing that he valued her enough to write things down, but in a way that was more collaborative. The secrecy could have made her feel like he didn't trust her with his thoughts or that he's hiding something. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to remember things because he's a guy who might not naturally remember all those details. The Almanac is a tool to help him show love in her way. But maybe the issue is the perception of a script. If she feels like every action he takes is from a list, it might feel insincere. \n\nI think the key here is the wife's feelings. Even if the intention is good, if the result is making her feel unappreciated or like a project, then the author might be in the wrong. The problem isn't the act of keeping notes but how it made her feel. He should have considered how she might perceive this and maybe discussed it with her instead of keeping it private. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife is overreacting. The author is trying to remember things because he loves her, and the notebook is just a tool. But the fact that she felt betrayed suggests that there's a deeper issue about trust or feeling like she's being used. \n\nIn some ways, the author's intent is positive, but the method might have been flawed. By keeping it secret, he didn't consider her perspective. Maybe he should have been more transparent. The wife's reaction is valid because she's feeling hurt, and the author should acknowledge her feelings even if his intentions were good. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But if the action (keeping the Almanac) caused her harm and he should have anticipated that, then he might be partially in the wrong. However, if the problem is entirely her perception, maybe not. But the fact that he was keeping it a secret and didn't consider her feelings might tip the scales towards A. \n\nBut wait, another angle: sometimes people in relationships have different love languages. She might value spontaneous gestures over planned ones, and him having a list might make her feel like he's not genuinely present. So even if his intention was good, the method clashed with her emotional needs. In that case, he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for compromise. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are good and he's trying to remember things to express his love. But maybe he should have been more open about it. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife feels betrayed and the action caused her pain, then technically, he might be in the wrong. But some might argue that it's not his fault because he didn't mean to hurt her. \n\nHmm. The answer could go either way. The key is that the wife's feelings are valid, but the author's intentions are also positive. In AITA scenarios, the answer often depends on the impact rather than intent. Since his actions caused her distress and betrayal even if unintended, maybe he's partially at fault. So perhaps A. But others might say he's not in the wrong because he had good intentions. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the problem is more about the wife's perception and the secrecy, but he's trying to do better. However, I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check similar AITA cases. In some cases, if someone's actions, though well-meaning, cause hurt without considering the other person's feelings, they might be at fault. But in this case, the author's actions were a personal gesture without malice. \n\nMaybe the answer is B because he's not in the wrong. The wife's reaction is about their communication issues, not his inherent wrongness. So the answer is B.\n"
