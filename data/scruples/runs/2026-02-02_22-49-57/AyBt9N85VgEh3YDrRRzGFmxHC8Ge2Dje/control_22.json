She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of their wife's preferences. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author started writing down things about his wife when they first met, like her love for lilacs. He did this to remember important details so he could do sweet things for her. The almanac was a personal notebook he used for that purpose. He never showed it to anyone, kept it private. But when his wife found it, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" thinking he was using it to manipulate or perform for her. Now she's upset, and he's questioning if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author's intention was genuine\u2014he wanted to remember things to be a good partner. He didn't share it with others, and it was a personal effort to show love. On the other hand, his wife's reaction suggests that she felt the act of writing things down was insincere or a strategy rather than genuine care. Maybe she felt that if he had to write them down, he wasn't truly remembering or caring enough on his own. Or perhaps she saw it as a tactic to gain approval, which made her feel like he wasn't being authentic.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't explain his reasoning to his wife before she found it. If he had shared his intention with her, maybe she would have understood. But he kept it a secret, which might have led to her feeling like he wasn't being open. However, the act of keeping the notebook itself isn't inherently wrong. People use different methods to remember things. The problem might be more about the lack of communication rather than the notebook itself.\n\nAnother angle: some people might feel that relying on written notes makes the gestures less personal. If the wife thought he only remembered these things because he wrote them down, not because he truly remembered, that could hurt her feelings. She might have wanted him to remember things naturally as a sign of his genuine care. The author intended to show love, but his wife interpreted it as a calculated approach.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit subjective. The intention was good, but the method might have been a misunderstanding. He didn't mean to harm her feelings, but he didn't consider her perspective. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there is room for him to have communicated better. However, the action of keeping the almanac isn't a clear mistake. It's more about the differing expectations between the couple. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, meaning he's not in the wrong. The issue is more about communication and differing perceptions rather than a clear ethical wrongdoing. He didn't do anything malicious; he just had a different way of showing love that his wife didn't interpret well. Therefore, he's not at fault, but he could have handled it better by explaining his actions.\n"
