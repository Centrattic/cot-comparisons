She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who keeps an \"Almanac\" of his wife's preferences and details to remember them. He did this from the beginning of their relationship, writing things like her favorite flowers, colors, etc., so he can do sweet things for her. Now his wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapens his gestures. The guy is confused because he didn't mean any harm and just wanted to remember things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love. Taking notes to avoid forgetting is practical, especially since he admitted he might forget otherwise. The wife, however, feels that having a written list makes his efforts insincere. She might think that if he has to write it down, he's not truly remembering from the heart. That could make her feel like his gestures are calculated rather than genuine.\n\nIs there a cultural or social norm here? In relationships, people often value authenticity. If someone relies on a written list, the partner might perceive it as not natural or as a strategy, which could make the partner feel less special. On the other hand, keeping notes to remember important details is a common practice for many people, especially those who want to be thoughtful.\n\nAnother angle: privacy and trust. The husband didn't hide the Almanac, but he also didn't mention it to anyone. The wife found it without him knowing she had it. Maybe she felt it was a secret he kept even though it's about her. If he had mentioned it to her, maybe she would have been okay with it. But since he didn't, she might feel he was keeping something from her that's personal about her.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. If the husband had explained the Almanac to her earlier, maybe she wouldn't have felt betrayed. His intention was good, but the lack of communication led to misunderstanding. However, the wife's reaction might be overly harsh considering the husband's good intentions. But her feelings are valid because she's upset about feeling like her husband is using a playbook, which could imply he's trying too hard or insincerely.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, his intention wasn't to hurt, but he didn't consider how she might feel about it. Maybe he should have discussed it with her. But then again, the wife might be overreacting. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think the answer hinges on intent versus perception. The wife's feelings are valid, so the husband might be at fault for not communicating his reasons. But if he genuinely didn't think she'd be upset, maybe not. But the fact that he kept it a secret (even if not intentional) and she found out, which caused her distress, could mean he's at least partially at fault. But I'm not sure if it's entirely his fault. Maybe the answer is B, No, because his intentions were good, but he might need to explain better. However, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually sides with the person not being the asshole if intentions are good. So maybe B.\n"
