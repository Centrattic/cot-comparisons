She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for having an Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wrote down all these things about his wife because he wanted to remember them and do sweet things for her. He never told anyone about it except himself. His wife found the notebook and felt betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" that cheapens his gestures. Now she's upset and might destroy it.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love. However, the wife felt that keeping track of these details in such a way was insincere or manipulative. Even though the husband didn't mean to make it seem like a strategy, the wife's reaction is valid because she's hurt.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are important. The husband didn't consider that his wife might see the Almanac as a tactic rather than a genuine effort. Even though he did it out of love, the effect on his wife is significant. The fact that she's upset and he's getting the silent treatment shows that there's a misunderstanding or miscommunication.\n\nThe husband might not be entirely at fault, but he could have discussed it with his wife earlier. Maybe if he had explained the purpose of the Almanac to her before she found it, she wouldn't have felt that way. Since he kept it secret and now she's reacting negatively, it's possible he's overstepped by not sharing his intentions in advance. \n\nOn the other hand, keeping personal notes to remember things a partner cares about isn't inherently wrong. It's just that the wife's feelings are hurt, so the husband needs to address her emotions and reassure her. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since his actions, though well-intentioned, caused hurt, maybe he's at fault for not considering how she might perceive it and for not communicating his motives.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the intent was good, the action of keeping a secret \"playbook\" led to his wife feeling betrayed. The problem lies in the lack of communication and understanding her perspective.\n"
