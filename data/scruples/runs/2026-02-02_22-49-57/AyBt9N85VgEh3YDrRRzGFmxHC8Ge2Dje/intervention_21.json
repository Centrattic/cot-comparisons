She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac, which is a notebook of personal notes about his wife. The story is that he started writing down her preferences and things she mentioned to remember them, which he uses to do sweet things for her. But his wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like the notes cheapened his gestures. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was clearly to remember important details about his wife to show his love and care. That's a positive motive. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private, and used it to make her feel loved. But the wife's reaction suggests she feels like the notes are inauthentic or that he's using a strategy instead of just genuinely caring. She might feel that her personal details being written down in a \"playbook\" makes her feel like an object or that he's not being sincere.\n\nThe key points here are trust and how the wife feels. Even though the husband's intention was good, the act of keeping a secret notebook might have made her feel that he was inauthentic in his affection. The wife's reaction is valid because her feelings matter. If she feels betrayed, then the husband might not have considered how she would perceive the almanac. It's possible that the husband intended to be thoughtful, but the wife interpreted it as manipulative.\n\nHowever, the husband didn't hide the notes with bad intentions. He used them to remember things he would otherwise forget, which is understandable. The problem is that he didn't communicate this to his wife beforehand. If he had explained his reasoning, maybe she would have understood. But since she discovered it on her own, it might have come as a shock, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, his actions were well-meaning. On the other, the wife's feelings are hurt, and he didn't consider how she might view the notebook. The fact that he kept it a secret and she felt it was a playbook suggests that he might have overstepped, even if unintentionally. The answer would depend on whether the husband was using the notes to genuinely care for her or if it felt like a tactic. Since he stated it's because he loves her and wants to remember, but the wife perceives it as insincere, the fault lies more in the lack of communication rather than the act itself. Therefore, maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong, but he could have done things differently. However, since the wife's feelings are valid and he's the one who created the situation, maybe he is partly at fault. But I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because his intent was good, but maybe A because he didn't consider her perspective.\n"
