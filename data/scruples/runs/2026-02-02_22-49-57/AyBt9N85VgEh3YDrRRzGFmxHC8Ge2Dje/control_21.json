She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. The wife found out and feels betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine effort to remember her preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband started writing things down because he didn't want to forget important details about his wife. He wanted to do sweet things for her. The wife, however, is upset because she thought he was supposed to remember these things naturally, not from a notes. She feels like the existence of the Almanac cheapens his efforts and makes her feel like he's just going through a list instead of truly caring.\n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, his intention was good. He wanted to remember things to show his love. But maybe the action of keeping such a detailed notebook without her knowledge made her feel like he wasn't truly present or genuine in remembering her. The wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed because she thought he should just remember these things as part of his love for her. The key here is the perception and the emotional impact on the wife. Even if the husband's intention was good, the fact that the wife feels hurt and betrayed means there's a problem in communication or expectations.\n\nThe husband didn't share this with her before, so it's a surprise to her. Maybe she values spontaneity and natural memory, whereas he uses a method to ensure he doesn't forget. The issue isn't the act of taking notes itself, but the fact that it's a secret and now it's causing her emotional distress. The husband might need to consider her feelings and explain his intentions better. However, the act of keeping the notes wasn't malicious, but the wife's reaction is valid. So, the answer depends on whether the husband's action is considered wrong. Since the wife is upset and the husband's action led to her feeling betrayed, even if unintentionally, it might be that he is in the wrong for not considering her perspective. But some might argue that taking notes isn't wrong. However, the situation is about the impact on the relationship. So, probably the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his intentions were good, but he might need to adjust his approach. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer is based on the fact that he didn't consider her feelings, then maybe A. But usually in these AITA cases, the moral is that intentions matter, but consequences do too. Since the wife is upset, maybe the answer is B because he's not in the wrong for the action itself, but he needs to address her feelings. Alternatively, maybe A because the action caused harm. Hmm. The question is whether he is in the wrong. If the answer is B, then he's not in the wrong because his intention was good. If A, then the action is wrong because it hurt her. I think it's B because the intention was good, but he needs to talk to her. The Almanac itself isn't wrong, but communication is needed. So the answer is B.\n"
