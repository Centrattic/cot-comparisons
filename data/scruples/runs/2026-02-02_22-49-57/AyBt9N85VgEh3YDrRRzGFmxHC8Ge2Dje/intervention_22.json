She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're a \"knock on their wife\" (AITA) for having an Almanac. The backstory is that he met his wife in 2008, and he started writing down things she told him about her likes and preferences in a notebook he calls The Almanac. He uses it to remember important details so he can do sweet things for her. But now his wife found it and is upset, feeling that it's a \"playbook\" and she feels betrayed. She's considering destroying it, and the author is heartbroken and worried.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author did something wrong. The author's intention was to show he was attentive and care about her by remembering those details. But his wife interprets it as manipulative or insincere, maybe even reducing the genuine gestures they've shared. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author wasn't trying to do anything wrong. He made a genuine effort to remember things because he loves her. On the other hand, his wife feels that the existence of the notebook undermines the sincerity of his actions. She might feel he's not truly paying attention if he's relying on notes, or that he's treating their relationship like a script. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't think about how his wife might feel if she found out about the notebook. Even though he had good intentions, the way he approached it might have been inconsiderate. Maybe he should have discussed with her how he remembers things, or asked if she was okay with him keeping notes. But since he kept it a secret, it might have felt like he was hiding something, which can lead to hurt feelings.\n\nBut then again, keeping a personal notebook is his way of remembering things. It's not like he's using it to manipulate her or for something harmful. The problem here is more about perception and the emotional impact rather than an actual wrongdoing. The wife's reaction is valid because she feels betrayed, even if the intention wasn't there. \n\nIn some cases, people might see note-taking as a positive sign of attention. But in this case, the wife's feelings are hurt. So the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but he might have failed to consider her perspective. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it's about whether his actions were incorrect. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural or personal norms. In some cultures, being so meticulous about remembering details is seen as caring. In others, it might be seen as insincere. But since the wife is clearly upset, it's a problem in their specific relationship. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but maybe he should have been more transparent. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If we go by the wife's feelings and the impact, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because his intention was good. But if the action itself, regardless of intent, is harmful, then maybe A. But the situation is more about differing expectations. He might not be in the wrong, but he needs to address her feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
