She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if they're at fault for keeping an almanac of personal notes about their wife. The backstory is sweet\u2014they met, he started writing down things about her, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why the wife might be upset. She said the almanac has cheapened the sweet things he does for her and that she felt betrayed. Even though he never showed it to anyone, she now feels like the gestures were part of a \"playbook\" instead of genuine expressions of love. That's a key point. She might feel like he's being insincere or manipulative, even if his intentions were good.\n\nBut then, the author's intention was to remember important things about her because he cares. He didn't want to be the guy who forgets stuff. So his actions were motivated by love, not some ulterior motive. However, the way the wife perceives it is different. In relationships, the perception often matters more than the intent. If she feels betrayed, that's a real emotional reaction, even if he didn't mean to cause hurt.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of privacy. By keeping a detailed record, maybe he crossed a line she didn't realize existed. She might have felt that these personal details were meant to be shared and remembered naturally, not documented in a book. The act of writing them down could make her feel like he's treating her as a case study or a project rather than a partner.\n\nAlso, the idea of him going through the book to plan gestures could lead her to think he's calculating rather than spontaneous. Even if he's using the notes to do nice things, the fact that it's all organized might make her feel like the gestures are part of a strategy, not heartfelt actions. That could undermine her trust in the sincerity of his actions.\n\nThe author is upset because he thinks the almanac is a symbol of his love. But the wife's reaction is about feeling that the notes have made her feel used or that the love isn't genuine. It's a conflict between intention and perception. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it's important to consider if there's an action that was inherently wrong. He didn't do anything like spying or using the notes for harm. But maybe he should have discussed the almanac with her first, to ensure she was comfortable with how he was handling her personal information.\n\nIn some relationships, keeping private records like that might be a red flag for one partner but not for another. The issue here is the lack of communication. If he had shared the concept of the almanac with her earlier, she might have reacted differently. Now that she's found out and it's causing issues, he might need to validate her feelings instead of just defending his actions.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the problem stems from differing expectations and lack of communication, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But if his actions, regardless of intent, caused her emotional distress and she feels betrayed, then he might share some responsibility for not considering her perspective. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and his actions were well-intentioned, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. But considering the impact on her feelings, maybe he is partially at fault for not being more mindful of how she might perceive it.\n"
