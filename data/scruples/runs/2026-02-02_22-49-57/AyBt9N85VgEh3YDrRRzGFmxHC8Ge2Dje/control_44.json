She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac of personal information about his wife. So, the author started this notebook to remember things like her favorite colors, movies, etc., to do sweet things for her. But when his wife found out, she was upset, called it a \"playbook,\" and felt betrayed. The question is whether he was wrong.\n\nHmm, so first, the author's intention was good. He wanted to remember important details because he cares. But the wife's reaction is negative. Why? Maybe she felt like he didn't genuinely remember those things naturally, or that he's using the notebook as a tool to manipulate her into thinking he's attentive when he's not. Or perhaps she values spontaneity and authenticity, and the notebook feels inauthentic or insincere.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the wife's feelings. The author didn't share his notes with anyone, but keeping the notebook was his choice. However, when his wife found out, she was upset. Maybe she felt that having to refer to a notebook meant he wasn't truly paying attention to her, that he wasn't making the effort from his heart. Or she might feel that the notes are a list of things to do to \"get brownie points,\" which is inauthentic. The term \"playbook\" suggests she sees it as a strategy to impress her, which could feel manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is genuine. He's trying to remember things he would otherwise forget, not to fake his care for her. But intentions don't always align with how someone else feels. The wife's perspective is valid here. If she feels that the existence of the notebook cheapens the gestures, then from her point of view, it's a problem. The author might need to understand that the issue isn't the notebook itself but how she perceives it. Maybe she wants to feel that the person knows her without needing notes, that the effort is natural and not forced.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but in terms of their relationship dynamics, he might have overstepped. The problem isn't the action itself but the emotional impact on his wife. Since the question is about being in the wrong in a relationship context, if his actions caused harm despite good intentions, he might need to take responsibility. However, the answer depends on whether the wife's feelings are valid, which they are. So the author might need to adjust his approach to respect her feelings, even if his intention was good.\n\nThe answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong (B) because his intentions were good, but he should consider her feelings and maybe find another way to remember things. However, some might argue that he should have respected her need for authenticity and not relied on the notebook. But since the question is about being in the wrong, not whether the approach is the best, the answer is B.\n"
