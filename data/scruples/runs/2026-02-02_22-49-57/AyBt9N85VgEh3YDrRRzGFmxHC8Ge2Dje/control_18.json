She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with personal notes about his wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author started keeping the almanac because he wanted to remember important things about his wife, like her favorite flowers, colors, etc. He did this to do sweet things for her, not to use it as a playbook. He mentions he never showed it to anyone and kept it private. The issue arose when his wife found it and felt betrayed, thinking he was treating her like a game. He's confused because he thought it was a good gesture, but now she's upset.\n\nNow, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intention was genuinely to remember his wife's preferences to make her happy. However, the problem is that the wife felt the almanac was manipulative or insincere. The term \"playbook\" suggests she felt he was using the notes to strategize, rather than being spontaneously affectionate.\n\nEven though the author didn't mean to be insincere, the way he documented these details might have come across as transactional to her. The wife's feelings are valid here. If something makes the partner feel like they're being played, it's an issue regardless of the intent. The author might not be in the wrong in intent, but the action of keeping the almanac led to her discomfort. \n\nHowever, the author didn't hide it maliciously; he just didn't realize it was a problem until she brought it up. He also mentioned he kept it private and used it for good reasons. The question is whether not being aware of her perspective makes him wrong. Since the wife's feelings are hurt and she feels betrayed, the answer might hinge on whether the action itself is wrong despite good intentions.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the impact on the other person. So even if the intent is good, if it caused harm, there's some responsibility. But in this case, the author's actions weren't harmful in intent. It's a communication issue. He didn't realize how she might perceive it. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but he needs to address her feelings. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his intent was good, but the situation requires him to be more considerate of her perspective in the future.\n"
