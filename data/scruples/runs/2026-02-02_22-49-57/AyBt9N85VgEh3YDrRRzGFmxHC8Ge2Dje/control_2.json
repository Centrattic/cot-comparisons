She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac with personal notes about his wife. The author started keeping these notes to remember things about her, like favorite colors, books, etc., to do sweet things. Now his wife is upset, feeling that it's a playbook and she feels betrayed.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand the key points. The author's intention was good, to remember things he might forget. He didn't share it with anyone. His wife found out and is upset because she thought he remembered things naturally. She feels like he's using a playbook, which makes her feel cheapened. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Well, intentions matter here. The author didn't have any bad intentions; he just wanted to be a good partner. However, the wife's feelings are valid. Maybe he should have discussed this with her before keeping such a detailed record. But was it wrong? Maybe he didn't consider how she might feel about him keeping a list. Perhaps he should have communicated better. \n\nOn the other hand, keeping notes is a common way for people to remember things. Not everyone can remember every detail off the top of their head. The issue is about perception. The wife might find it insincere, thinking that he's going through a checklist instead of genuinely being present. \n\nBut the author didn't hide it; the name is on the cover, so maybe she found it without him knowing. However, he didn't mention it to her. Maybe he should have. But again, his intention was good. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had good intentions, but maybe he should have discussed it. However, his wife's feelings are also valid. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since he didn't do it with malice, it's more about misunderstanding. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
