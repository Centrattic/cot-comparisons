She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who keeps an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and details, which he uses to plan sweet gestures. His wife found it and feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like it cheapens his actions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her and doesn't want to forget. He kept it private, never shared it, and used it to do nice things. He didn't think there was anything wrong with taking notes to help remember. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is upset. She might feel that her personal details being written down make her uncomfortable. Maybe she thinks it's not genuine if he has to refer to a list, or she feels like he's treating her like a project to \"win.\" The term \"playbook\" suggests she sees it as a strategy, which could imply manipulation or insincerity. Even though his intentions are good, her feelings are valid here. Trust and communication are key in relationships. \n\nThe husband didn't realize that keeping such a detailed record might make her uncomfortable. He didn't discuss it with her, so it came as a shock. This could be a case of differing love languages. He might be expressing love through acts of service and remembering details, while she might value more spontaneous or heartfelt gestures without the underlying sense of planning. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he didn't have bad intentions, but he didn't consider her perspective. Intention vs. impact. Even if his motives were pure, the impact on her feelings matters. In relationships, sometimes what you do, even with good intentions, can affect your partner in unintended ways. Not consulting her about keeping such notes might be an oversight in communication. \n\nBut then, is it his fault for not foreseeing that? Maybe not. He might not be aware that some people find it unsettling. However, since it's causing her distress, he needs to address it. The question is whether he's at fault. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the actions were wrong, regardless of intent. So even if he didn't mean to hurt her, if his actions led to her feeling betrayed, he might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she's considering destroying the Almanac shows how hurt she is. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he kept a detailed record of her personal information without her knowledge or consent, which made her feel uncomfortable and betrayed. Even with good intentions, it's about respecting her feelings and boundaries. The husband should have communicated this practice to her earlier.\n"
