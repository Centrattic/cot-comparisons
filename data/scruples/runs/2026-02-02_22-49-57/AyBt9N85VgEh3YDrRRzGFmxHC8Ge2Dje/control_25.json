She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of details about his wife. The situation is that he started writing down things like her favorite color, restaurants, books, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. Now his wife is upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's using it to manipulate her, leading to betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The author says he's doing it out of love, to remember important things about his wife. He mentions he doesn't want to be the guy who forgets stuff. So his intention is positive. However, the wife feels it's cheapening the gestures and that he's using a playbook, which makes her feel like he's not genuine.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the action itself is wrong. The author didn't share this almanac with anyone, and he created it in good faith. But the issue arises from the wife's perspective. Even if the author had good intentions, if his actions are causing emotional harm, then maybe he's in the wrong. But some might argue that he's not wrong because his intentions were good, and he didn't mean to make her feel that way.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, transparency is important. The author kept the almanac a secret, which might have contributed to the wife's feeling of betrayal. If he had shared this with her earlier, maybe she wouldn't have reacted this way. But he thought it was a private way to show his love. However, the fact that he didn't discuss it with her before using it for gestures might have been a mistake.\n\nThe wife's reaction is about feeling like the gestures are insincere because they're based on a list. She values spontaneity and genuine memory, not relying on notes. This could be a matter of differing perspectives on what constitutes sincerity in a relationship. The author might not be wrong in his approach, but he might have failed to communicate his intentions, leading to misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the question is whether keeping the almanac is wrong. If the author's actions, despite good intentions, caused his wife emotional distress and feelings of betrayal, then maybe he is in the wrong. However, others might say that he's not wrong because he had no malicious intent and was trying to be thoughtful. The answer hinges on whether intent or the actual impact is more important in this context.\n\nConsidering that the wife is clearly hurt and the author's secrecy might have played a role, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But others might say B (No) because his intentions were good. However, in relationship advice scenarios, often the emphasis is on communication and how one's actions affect their partner. So if the action, regardless of intent, made the partner feel betrayed, then the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings and keeping it secret.\n"
