She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife to remember them and do sweet things for her. His wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook.\" The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife because he cares. He didn't share it with anyone else. But the wife felt that keeping it was a bad thing. The key points here are about trust and intentions. \n\nThe author didn't hide the existence of the Almanac per se, but he kept it a secret to himself. The wife found out and the reaction was negative. Why would she feel betrayed? Maybe she felt that keeping track of her personal details in a notebook made her feel like he's treating her like a case to manage, rather than being genuine. Or perhaps she values spontaneity and doesn't want her partner to have a \"strategy\" for making her feel loved. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to show love and care by remembering things. He's trying to avoid being the type of partner who forgets important details. So is his action wrong? Well, it's about perspective. If the wife interprets the notebook as a manipulative tactic, then the author might be in the wrong for not understanding her feelings. But if he had good intentions and the wife is overreacting, then he's not in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the issue is about privacy. The wife might have felt that her personal preferences and secrets were being documented in a way that she didn't consent to. Even if it's for good reasons, she might feel her privacy was invaded. \n\nBut then again, the author is documenting things that the wife shared with him. If he's just noting down things she told him, maybe the problem is more about how he used it. Did he use the notes to surprise her or to make her feel special? If so, that's not inherently wrong. But maybe she felt it was manipulative, like he's using the information to get a positive reaction out of her.\n\nThe author's actions were done without malice, but the wife's feelings are valid. The question is whether the action itself was wrong or if it's a miscommunication. In relationships, perception matters a lot. If the wife feels betrayed, even if the intent was good, the author might need to take responsibility for not considering her feelings in advance. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't ask for her opinion or consider how she might feel about having her personal details written down. Even with good intentions, not discussing it with her first could be a mistake. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, since his actions led to hurt feelings, some might argue that he is partially at fault because he didn't communicate his intentions, even though they were good.\n\nAlternatively, if the act of keeping the Almanac is seen as a genuine expression of care, then he's not in the wrong. The problem is the wife's reaction, which might be over the top. \n\nI need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). Given that the author had good intentions and the wife's reaction is based on her perception, but the act of keeping the notebook isn't inherently wrong, the answer might be B. However, if the problem is that he didn't consider her feelings and privacy, then A. \n\nBut the author didn't use the information in a harmful way. The issue is the wife's interpretation. In such cases, it's often a mix of both, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't have malicious intent, and the action was meant to show love, the answer is likely B. However, maybe the act of keeping a \"playbook\" is seen as insincere, so A. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The answer might depend on how the action is perceived in the relationship. If the wife feels it's manipulative, even if it's not, then the author might be in the wrong for not understanding her perspective. But if the author's intent was genuine, then he's not. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (No), because the author's actions were based on love and care, even if the wife perceived it negatively. The fault isn't entirely his unless he had malicious intent, which he didn't. The problem is more on the wife's side for misunderstanding his intentions. So the answer is B.\n"
