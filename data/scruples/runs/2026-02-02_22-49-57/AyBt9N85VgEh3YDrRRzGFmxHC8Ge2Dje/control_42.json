She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac with notes about his wife's preferences and memories. The key points here are the wife's reaction and the reasons behind the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the author started the Almanac to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite things. He didn't share it with anyone and only used it to make her feel special. His intention was to show his care and attention. However, when she found out, she felt betrayed, thinking it was a \"playbook\" and that he was using it inauthentically. \n\nNow, the main question is whether his actions crossed a line. On one hand, keeping personal notes seems harmless and even thoughtful. He didn't do anything deceitful; he just wanted to remember. The problem arises from her perspective. She felt like the notes cheapened the gestures, maybe because she felt he wasn't being genuine anymore. She might have preferred that he remember things naturally rather than from a list. \n\nBut is the author wrong? If he wasn't using it in a manipulative way and only to express love, maybe not. However, the fact that she's upset is significant. The issue could be about trust and how personal information is handled. Even though he intended to be loving, keeping a notebook that she didn't know about might have invaded her privacy, making her feel like her personal details were being cataloged without her consent. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the way he used it was fine. The problem is more about their communication. Maybe they should talk about why she feels that way. The author's intentions were good, but he didn't consider that his wife might view the notebook as inauthentic. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the method of remembering (using a notebook) was the problem. If the wife feels that it's a calculated effort rather than genuine effort, then maybe the author's approach is an issue. But if the problem is just about her feelings of betrayal without any malicious intent, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, since he kept it a secret and she felt betrayed, maybe that's where the mistake was. Not that the Almanac itself is bad, but the secrecy and lack of transparency could be the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but he needs to communicate better. However, if the secrecy and the way he used the notes made her feel like her personal information was being stored for ulterior motives, then he might be at fault (A). The line between helping to remember and being genuine is blurry here. The key is that the wife's feelings are valid, but the author's intentions were good. It's a communication issue rather than a right or wrong action. So, maybe the answer is B, but with the need for discussion.\n"
