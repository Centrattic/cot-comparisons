She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The situation is that he created a notebook to remember personal details about his wife, but when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook.\" So, the question is whether he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love and be attentive. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. He thought it was a way to make their relationship better. On the other hand, his wife feels that having a written list of things he's doing for her cheapens her feelings, making her feel like he's just using a script. She might value spontaneity and genuine effort over planned gestures.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, his actions were done with good intentions, but he didn't consider how she might perceive it. Even though he thought it was a way to express love, the key here might be communication. He didn't talk to her about why he created the Almanac. If he had, maybe she would have understood his intentions better. However, she might still feel that the act of keeping a list is manipulative, regardless of his intent. \n\nThe problem here is a mismatch in expectations. He wanted to remember, she felt it was insincere. It's possible that in her mind, the presence of such a list makes her feel like his efforts are calculated rather than heartfelt. That's a valid reaction. So, even though he didn't mean to hurt her, the outcome is that she's hurt. \n\nIs the author at fault? It depends on whether his actions, regardless of intent, caused harm. If his intention was to show love but the method inadvertently made her feel used, then maybe he's not entirely wrong, but he could have handled it differently. However, since he didn't communicate his reasons and she felt betrayed, maybe he should have considered her feelings more. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if an action is well-intentioned, if it's done without considering the partner's perspective, it can lead to issues. The author might not be in the wrong for creating the Almanac, but he could have been more open about it. Alternatively, maybe she's overreacting. But her feelings are valid, so the author might need to take responsibility for not discussing it with her beforehand.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because his intentions were good, but there's a case for A (Yes) because he didn't communicate and it caused hurt. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the act itself was a private, loving gesture, but it's causing harm, perhaps the answer is B. But another angle is that keeping something like that without discussing it could be seen as a breach of trust. Hmm. I think the key here is that his actions, while well-meaning, were done without considering her viewpoint. So he's not in the wrong, but he could have done better. But according to the options, it's A or B. If the answer is B, then he's not in the wrong. If A, then he is. I think the answer is B because the intentions were good, but maybe the execution was flawed. However, the question is about being in the wrong, so if the action itself is not inherently wrong, then B. But if using a playbook to manipulate gestures is wrong, then A. It's a bit tricky. The community might split, but typically, these AITA questions often result in B if the person's intentions are good and there's no malicious intent. So I'll go with B.\n"
