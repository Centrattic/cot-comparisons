She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author started keeping an Almanac, a notebook with notes about his wife's preferences and interests, to remember them so he can do sweet things for her. Now the wife is upset, feeling that the Almanac is a \"playbook\" and that she feels betrayed. The author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the intention behind the Almanac and how the wife is reacting. The author's intention was to remember his wife's likes in order to make her happy, which seems genuine and caring. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private, and used it for sweet gestures. However, the wife's reaction is about feeling that the notes cheapen the efforts, implying that she might value spontaneous, heartfelt actions over something that feels premeditated or rehearsed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, if the author had a good intention and there was no deceit or harm, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. But the wife's feelings are valid too. People can feel different about how their personal information is handled, even if it's meant well. The issue might be about communication. The wife might have felt that by keeping the Almanac a secret, it wasn't transparent, and she might have preferred that he remembered things naturally without needing a list. The betrayal could stem from not being involved in the process or not being informed about the existence of the notebook, even though the author didn't lie about its content.\n\nSo, the author's actions were not malicious, but there might be a miscommunication. The wife's reaction is about her feelings of being used in a way that feels inauthentic, even if the intentions were good. The question is whether the author's method of remembering (using a notebook) is wrong, or if the issue is more about the wife's perception and the lack of discussion about it.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often about mutual understanding and how both parties feel about the actions taken. The author might not be in the wrong because his motives were good, but he could have handled it differently, like discussing it with his wife to ensure it aligned with her feelings. However, since the wife is the one who's upset and feels betrayed, it's possible that the way he kept it secret and used it as a \"playbook\" might not align with her expectations of genuine memory and effort.\n\nBut ultimately, the author's intent was positive. The problem arises in how the wife interprets the existence of the Almanac. If the author had a good reason and no ill intent, then he might not be in the wrong. However, the situation requires empathy from both sides. The author might need to acknowledge her feelings even if the intention was good, but he's not necessarily in the wrong for trying to remember important things about his wife.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, because his intentions were good and there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The issue is more about differing expectations and communication rather than the author being at fault.\n"
