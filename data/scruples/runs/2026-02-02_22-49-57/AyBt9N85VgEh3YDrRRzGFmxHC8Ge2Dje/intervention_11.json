She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about their wife. The situation is that the wife found out about the notebook and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook.\" The author's intention was to remember important details about his wife to do sweet things for her, but the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's trying to show love and care by remembering things. The wife, on the other hand, feels like it's insincere because she thought he remembered on his own. The key here is intent vs. perception. The author didn't have any ill intentions; he wanted to be a better partner. However, the wife's feelings are valid because she might feel that the notes make the gestures feel rehearsed instead of genuine.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't deceive her and the notebook was a personal tool, then maybe he's not wrong. But the problem is that the wife didn't know about it until now, which might have made her feel like the gestures were premeditated rather than heartfelt. The author kept it secret, which could be an issue because sharing such personal items might be necessary in a relationship. However, the author didn't use the notebook to manipulate or harm; he used it to show love.\n\nThere's a difference between using a tool to remember things and making someone feel like their efforts are insincere. The wife's reaction is about feeling like the love isn't genuine. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might have inadvertently caused that feeling. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions are good, but the impact on the wife is negative. However, the author didn't have malicious intent. In many relationships, people have different ways of showing love. The wife might need more organic gestures rather than planned ones. The author might need to adjust his approach but isn't necessarily in the wrong because he didn't intend to hurt her. The main issue is communication. The wife's feelings are valid, but the author isn't at fault for trying to be considerate. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
