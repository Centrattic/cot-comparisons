She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac. Let me start by reading through the situation again. \n\nThe author met his wife in 2008, and over time, he started writing down various personal details about her that he wanted to remember. He did this in a little notebook called The Almanac. His intention was to remember her favorite things so he could do sweet things for her. Recently, his wife found the notebook, got upset, and felt betrayed, calling it his \"playbook.\" Now, he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are his intentions versus her feelings. He meant well, trying to be a thoughtful partner by remembering her preferences. But she felt like it was manipulative, maybe because she thought he didn't truly remember from the heart, or she felt it was a tactic rather than genuine effort. \n\nI should consider whether keeping the notebook was an invasion of privacy or if it's a reasonable way to stay attentive. The author didn't share it with anyone else, so it was between him and his wife. But when she found out, she felt hurt. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Maybe the author didn't realize that she had different expectations about how he should remember things. She might have wanted him to internalize the information instead of relying on a written list. Alternatively, she might feel that he was using the notebook to track her in a way that's uncomfortable. \n\nBut he had good intentions. He wasn't using it for any manipulative purpose, just to help him remember. The problem is that his actions led to her feeling betrayed. So maybe the issue is about how the action was perceived rather than the action itself. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he kept it a secret because he didn't want her to know he needed a notebook, that could be a problem. But he didn't hide it from her in a malicious way; he just didn't mention it because he thought it was a private way to stay organized. \n\nOn the other hand, if he was using the notebook to play \"games\" to win her affection, then he would be in the wrong. But his reasoning here is about genuine care. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling like her personal details were being cataloged without her consent, which could feel intrusive. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The author didn't consider that his wife might perceive the notebook differently. Even with good intentions, the way he approached keeping the almanac might not align with his wife's feelings about authenticity in their relationship. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I'm leaning towards B (No), because his intentions were positive. However, the way he handled it could be seen as a lack of communication. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether there's room for improvement. Since he didn't act with malice, maybe the answer is B.\n"
