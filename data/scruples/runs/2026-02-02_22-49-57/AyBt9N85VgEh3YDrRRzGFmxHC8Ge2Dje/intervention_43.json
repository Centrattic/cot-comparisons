She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down personal details about his wife to remember them. The wife found out and felt betrayed, thinking the notes cheapened his gestures and that it was like a \"playbook.\"\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no (he's not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband's intention was to remember his wife's preferences and do sweet things for her. He kept the notebook private, never showed it to anyone, and didn't share it. The wife, on the other hand, felt that having a written list made his gestures less genuine. She perceives it as insincere, maybe even manipulative, hence the betrayal.\n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, his actions were meant to show love and care. But the problem lies in perception and how the wife feels about it. The husband didn't have any malicious intent; he was trying to be a considerate partner. However, the wife's feelings of betrayal are valid because she wasn't aware of the notebook, and the existence of it made her uncomfortable. \n\nBut in relationships, sometimes even well-intentioned actions can cause hurt if they're perceived differently. The key here is whether the husband overstepped by keeping such detailed notes without her knowledge. However, the act of taking notes to remember things isn't inherently wrong. It's more about the wife's emotional response. \n\nThe husband didn't use the notebook in a way that's harmful, like keeping secrets for manipulation. He used it to express love. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling that her personal details being documented felt like he was reducing her to a list, making her feel objectified. But that's a matter of perspective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the husband didn't have any bad intentions and the wife is now upset, maybe the issue is more about communication. The husband didn't think to discuss it with her, which might have prevented the hurt feelings. However, the act itself isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions were good, and there's no evidence of malicious intent. The wife's feelings are important, but the husband isn't the one at fault here. He just needs to address her feelings and maybe adjust how he shows his care.\n"
