She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who kept a notebook with all sorts of personal details about his wife, like her favorite things, to remember and do sweet things for her. But when the wife found out, she felt betrayed and called it his \"playbook,\" making her feel like he was just using it as a strategy. The husband is confused because he thought it was a sweet gesture to remember important things about her.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember her preferences and show his love by writing them down. He kept it private and didn't share it with anyone. However, the wife felt it was cheapening the sweet things he did for her. She might feel that instead of genuinely remembering her, he was relying on a list, which could make her feel like her personal details were just items on a list rather than meaningful to him. \n\nThe key points here are the wife's feelings and the husband's intentions. The husband didn't mean to hurt her, but the effect was there. Sometimes, even with the best intentions, actions can be perceived differently. The wife might feel like her personal information is private, and having it written down in a notebook makes her uncomfortable. She might also feel like the husband is treating their relationship like a game where he has strategies, which could make her feel like he's not being authentic.\n\nAnother angle is trust. The husband didn't inform the wife about the notebook, which might make her feel that he kept secrets. Even though he didn't intend to, the existence of the notebook could be seen as a breach of trust because it's a private collection of her personal details without her knowledge. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intent was to remember and show love, which is a positive action. He didn't share it with others, and it's clear he cares. However, the problem arises from the wife's perspective. The fact that she's upset shows that the method he used to remember her preferences caused her discomfort. The real issue here might be communication. If the husband had shared his intention with her, maybe she would have understood better. But since he didn't, and her reaction is based on feeling betrayed, it's a matter of whether the method of keeping the notebook was respecting her boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even though the husband's actions were well-meaning, the way he handled it (keeping it secret) led to her feeling that her personal information was being stored without her consent. That could be a breach of trust. So, even though he wasn't in the wrong in terms of his intent, his actions might have crossed a boundary from her perspective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because his intentions were good. However, there's a discussion about boundaries and communication. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the wife's reaction is based on her feelings from his actions, the answer might be a bit nuanced. But according to the options given (A for yes, B for no), the answer would likely be B because he didn't have malicious intent and the issue is more about differing perspectives on privacy and communication.\n"
