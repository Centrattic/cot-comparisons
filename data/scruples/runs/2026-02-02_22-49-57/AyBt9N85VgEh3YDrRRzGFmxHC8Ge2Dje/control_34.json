She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of notes about his wife. The wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a playbook that cheapened his gestures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author started the almanac to remember things about his wife, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. He didn't show it to anyone and kept it private. His intention was to show love and remember details, which is a good motive.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife felt it was a playbook, implying she thought he was using it to manipulate her or that he wasn't being genuine. She might have felt that his gestures were insincere if they were planned based on notes. Trust is important in a relationship, and maybe she felt her privacy was invaded. The fact that he kept it secret for so long could have contributed to her feeling hurt when she found out.\n\nIs keeping notes inherently wrong? Probably not. Many people write things down to remember. But the issue here is the wife's reaction. The author didn't have bad intentions, but maybe he should have discussed it with her instead of keeping it a secret. Transparency in relationships is key. If he had shared his method of remembering things with her earlier, she might not have felt betrayed. The problem might stem from the secrecy rather than the act itself. However, since the wife is the one who found it and reacted this way, it's a matter of whether the author's actions, though well-intentioned, crossed a line by not being open about it.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were good, but maybe he could have handled it better by being more open. The answer is B (No), but there's a nuance where communication could have been improved. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, and since his actions were to show love and without malice, the answer leans towards B.\n"
