She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of details about his wife. Let me parse the situation.\n\nSo, the author started writing down little things his wife mentioned, like her favorite flowers, colors, etc., because he wanted to remember them and do sweet things for her. He thought it was a good way to show he cares. But then his wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and saying it cheapened the sweet things he did. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intention versus perception. The author's intention was to remember and be thoughtful, but his wife's reaction is negative. Why would she feel that way? Maybe she felt like he was treating the relationship like a script, using the notes as a tool to manipulate her feelings. She might value spontaneity and genuine effort over prepared actions based on a list. Also, the fact that he kept it a secret could be an issue. Even if he didn't mean to, not sharing such a significant part of his relationship with her might have made her feel excluded or that he wasn't fully open.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He was trying to be a considerate partner. But the problem arises from the wife's perspective. In relationships, how we express love can vary, and what one person sees as thoughtful, another might see as inauthentic. The wife's feeling of betrayal is valid here. Even if the almanac was meant well, the act of keeping it could be seen as not trusting his own memory or not engaging genuinely in the relationship. Maybe she wanted the gestures to come from the heart without being planned from a list.\n\nAlso, the secrecy around the almanac is important. If he never showed it to anyone and kept it hidden, that might make her feel like he's keeping things from her, which can erode trust. Even if the intention was good, the lack of transparency could be part of the problem.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, it's about respecting each other's needs and communication. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action did hurt his wife's feelings. However, some might argue that his approach was manipulative or insincere. The answer could depend on cultural or personal expectations. But since the wife is clearly upset, the author should consider her perspective. So, maybe the answer is A because he is in the wrong for not considering how she might feel about the almanac and keeping it a secret, even if his intentions were good.\n"
