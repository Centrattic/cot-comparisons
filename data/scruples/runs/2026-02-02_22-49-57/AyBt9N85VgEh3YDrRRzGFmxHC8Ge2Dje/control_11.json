She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an \"Almanac\" with details about his wife. From the story, the husband started writing down things about his wife like her favorite things, which he uses to remember and do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone, and it was meant to show his love. But when his wife found it, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel like he was using a script instead of genuinely remembering.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about intention versus perception. The husband's intention was to remember things to be a good partner, which is positive. However, the wife's reaction is negative because she felt it made her feel like he wasn't being genuine. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if there's a breach of trust or if the action itself is inherently wrong. The husband didn't share it with anyone, so secrecy isn't the issue. The problem is that the wife felt her feelings were cheapened. Maybe she felt he was treating their relationship like a checklist instead of from the heart. But is that his fault? He didn't mean to make her feel that way.\n\nAnother angle: does keeping a personal journal of things about a spouse cross a line? Probably not, unless it's used in a manipulative way. The husband's intent was good. However, the wife's feelings are valid. The issue might be communication. He didn't consider how she might feel about it. So maybe he's not wrong in intent, but the action had unintended consequences. But does that make him at fault?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife's reaction is over the top. She might be insecure or have a different view on what's genuine. The husband didn't do anything malicious, but the wife's feelings are hurt. So the problem is more about their communication and differing expectations rather than the husband being wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, the person's intent matters. If the husband didn't have bad intentions, he's not in the wrong. The wife's reaction is valid, but the husband isn't at fault for the action itself. The problem is their differing perspectives, not a clear wrong action. So answer B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
