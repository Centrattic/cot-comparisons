She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for having an Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife to remember them. The wife found out and is upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband started the Almanac because he wanted to remember things his wife told him, like her love for lilacs. He uses it to make sweet gestures for her. The wife is hurt and feels that instead of genuinely remembering things, he's using a list, which makes her feel like he's just following a script. She might feel that his actions are insincere or that he's not truly paying attention to her.\n\nSo, why is the wife upset? She might feel that the Almanac is a way for him to track her for his own benefit, maybe even manipulative. Even though the husband's intention is to remember things to show his love, the perception is that he's using a playbook, which could make her feel like he's not being genuine. Trust is a big factor here. The wife might have felt that if he truly loved her, he would remember those things naturally without needing a list.\n\nBut on the other hand, the husband's intention is pure. He wants to remember important details because he cares and fears being the husband who forgets things. He didn't share it with anyone, keeping it private. The problem arises in how the wife interprets the existence of the Almanac. It's possible that the act of writing things down makes her feel objectified, as if her personal details are just data points for him to use.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he didn't have malicious intent. But maybe he didn't consider how she would feel about him keeping such records. Trust and open communication are key in relationships. If he hadn't mentioned the Almanac before, and she found out this way, it might make her feel that he kept a secret that's personal to her. Even if his intentions are good, the secrecy might have contributed to her feeling of betrayal.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband's actions are wrong. The answer would depend on whether the action itself (having the Almanac) is wrong, regardless of intent. If the wife's feelings are valid and she's hurt, then the husband might need to adjust his approach. However, the husband isn't in the wrong because his intention is to show love and care. The conflict here is about differing expectations and communication issues rather than a clear right or wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, people have different ways of expressing love. The husband's method is through detailed note-taking, which works well for him. However, the wife's emotional response indicates that this method isn't working for her. The key issue is the lack of communication. The husband didn't consider how she might feel about the Almanac and didn't discuss it with her before. So, while the intent is good, the manner in which he kept the Almanac could be seen as a misstep because he didn't involve her in the process. \n\nTherefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because the action itself isn't harmful. But he might need to adjust his approach to accommodate his wife's feelings. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because his intentions are positive, and the issue is more about communication and differing perspectives rather than malicious behavior.\n"
