She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac with notes about his wife. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author met his wife in 2008, and over the years, he started writing down little details about her\u2014her favorite things, etc., to remember and do sweet things. He called it the Almanac. He never showed it to anyone, and it was a secret. But when his wife found it, she was upset. She felt it was a \"playbook\" and that he was using it to manipulate or insincere acts. Now she's giving him the silent treatment and might destroy it. The author is upset because he thought it showed his love and effort to remember her preferences.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants to know my take.\n\nWell, let's break it down. The key points are intention vs. perception. The author's intention was genuine\u2014he wanted to remember her likes and do thoughtful things. But his wife perceived it as a manipulative tactic, a playbook. The problem here is that while his actions were well-meaning, the way she interpreted it caused hurt. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even though he didn't mean any harm, keeping something like that secret might lead to misunderstandings. Maybe he didn't consider that she might see it as a strategy rather than a heartfelt gesture. The fact that she felt betrayed or that it cheapened his actions suggests that the method of keeping notes wasn't the issue, but the secrecy and how she interpreted it.\n\nBut was he in the wrong? Well, he didn't have ill intent. He was trying to be a good husband. However, maybe he should have discussed it with her or realized that documenting things in such a private way could be misinterpreted. It's a gray area. On one hand, his actions were loving. On the other, the wife's feelings are valid. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but perhaps in the approach\u2014by keeping it a secret and not considering her perspective. But does that make him in the wrong? The question is whether he's in the wrong, not just if there's room for improvement.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both intent and impact. If his wife is hurt, even if unintentionally, he might need to acknowledge her feelings and work on communication. But does that mean he's \"in the wrong\"? In terms of moral blame, maybe not entirely. So perhaps answer B (not in the wrong) because his intentions were good, but he could have handled it differently. The wife's reaction is valid, but the author isn't malicious. It's more about a communication breakdown.\n"
