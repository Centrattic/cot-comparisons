She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for having an almanac where he writes down things about his wife. The situation is that he created this notebook to remember important details about her, like her favorite things, and he uses it to do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapened his gestures. The author is confused and heartbroken because he thought it was a thoughtful gesture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife and show his love through actions. He didn't share it with anyone, so the secrecy might not be the issue. However, his wife's reaction is significant. She feels that the almanac made her feel like her partner was using a script, which might make her feel like he's not genuine or that his gestures are insincere. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't realize that his actions could be perceived negatively. He might not have considered that his wife might see the notes as a tactic rather than a heartfelt effort. The fact that she hasn't decided whether to destroy it shows the depth of her hurt. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, his actions were not malicious. He intended to do something loving. The issue might be more about differing perspectives on what constitutes genuine effort. However, maybe he should have discussed this with her earlier, especially since she mentioned that she always thought he remembered things naturally. By using the almanac, he might have inadvertently made her feel like he couldn't remember things without a list. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a personal way to show love or if they inadvertently caused harm. Since the wife is the one who's upset, and the author's intentions were good, it's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because his actions were sincere, but he needs to address the issue with his wife to understand her feelings better. However, if the problem is that the method of using a list made her feel like his gestures were insincere, then maybe the author should have considered her perspective. But ultimately, the answer is likely B, not in the wrong, because his intentions were positive. The main issue is communication rather than malice.\n"
