She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Almanac) is in the wrong. The situation revolves around a husband keeping a notebook with personal details about his wife, which he uses to remember things to do sweet things for her. But his wife found out, and now she's upset, feeling betrayed and like the Almanac is a \"playbook.\" The author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband started the Almanac to remember things his wife mentioned because he wanted to show he cared. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. The wife found it and feels like the sweet gestures are insincere because they're part of a playbook. She's hurt and considering destroying it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband was wrong to keep the Almanac. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but wants to know another perspective.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Intentions vs. impact. The husband's intention was to show love and remember details, but the wife felt it was manipulative. Honesty in relationships: Did he have a duty to disclose the existence of the Almanac? Secrecy: Keeping it a secret might be part of the issue if she felt it was something that should have been shared.\n\nAnother angle: Trust and transparency. Even if the intent was good, the wife might feel that keeping such a personal record without her knowledge undermines trust. She might feel like he's not being genuine, as if he's strategizing instead of naturally remembering things out of love.\n\nAlso, the concept of a \"playbook\" implies a script, which can make actions feel calculated rather than heartfelt. If she values spontaneity and organic gestures, the Almanac might clash with that. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, might not align with her emotional needs.\n\nBut on the flip side, the husband's actions were meant to show care and effort. He wasn't using the Almanac to deceive but to improve their relationship. The fact that he kept it private could be seen as trying to surprise her, which is a common way people express love through thoughtfulness.\n\nHowever, the problem arises when secrecy leads to feelings of betrayal. Even if the intent was good, the outcome is that the wife is hurt. In relationships, communication is key. Maybe the husband should have discussed the Almanac with her sooner to avoid misunderstanding. But he didn't do that, thinking it was a sweet surprise.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The husband's intentions were good, but the lack of communication and the wife's hurt feelings suggest that he might have overlooked her perspective. Whether he's in the wrong could depend on whether keeping such a secret, even with good intentions, is considered a breach of trust.\n\nIn some relationships, keeping personal notes is a common way to remember things, but if the partner feels it's a playbook, it might indicate deeper issues about how each partner views love gestures. The husband might not be in the wrong, but the situation highlights a mismatch in expectations. The wife's reaction is valid because her feelings are hurt, even if the husband's actions were sincere.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because his intentions were positive and aimed at showing love. However, the situation shows that better communication could have prevented the hurt. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just if there's room for improvement. Given that, the author's actions were well-intentioned, so he's not in the wrong, but there's a lesson in communication here.\n"
