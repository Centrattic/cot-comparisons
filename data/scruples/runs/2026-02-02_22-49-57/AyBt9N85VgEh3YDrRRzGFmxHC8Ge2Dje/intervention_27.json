She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author created an Almanac where he wrote down all the little things about his wife\u2014her favorite things, preferences, etc. He used this to remember and do sweet things for her. But his wife found out, and now she's upset. She feels it's a \"playbook\" and that he's using it to manipulate her, leading to betrayal. He's confused because he never meant to make her feel that way and is heartbroken.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good; he wanted to show love and remember important things. But the wife's reaction is valid too. Maybe she feels that he's keeping a secret that makes his gestures seem insincere. The key here is intent versus perception. The author didn't lie about the existence of the Almanac, but he kept it a secret, which might have caused trust issues.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the author's actions were well-meaning, not discussing this with his wife might have led to misunderstanding. The wife might have felt that her personal details were being documented without her consent, which could make her uncomfortable. Even though he didn't share it with others, the act of keeping such a detailed record might have crossed a line from her perspective.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were driven by love and the desire to remember her preferences. There's no indication of misuse or harm beyond her emotional reaction. The question is whether the secrecy or the act of creating the Almanac itself is wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, people have ways of showing love that others might not understand. But if something causes discomfort, it's worth addressing. The wife's feeling of betrayal suggests that the method of keeping the Almanac wasn't appropriate in her eyes. The author might need to reflect on why she feels that way and find a way to rebuild trust, but technically, his intention wasn't malicious. So, maybe he's not in the wrong (B), but he needs to address her feelings. However, depending on cultural or personal boundaries, some might argue he is (A). But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed despite his good intentions, it's a nuanced case. But since he didn't have ill intent, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
