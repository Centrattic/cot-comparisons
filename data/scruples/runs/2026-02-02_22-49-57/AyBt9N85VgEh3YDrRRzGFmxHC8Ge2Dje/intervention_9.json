She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac where he writes down personal details about his wife. The situation is that his wife found out about it and now she's upset, feeling like he's using it as a \"playbook,\" which has made her feel betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife to do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. He created it as a way to show love and effort. On the other hand, his wife's reaction is that it cheapened his gestures, making her feel like he's just following a script instead of being genuine. She might be hurt because she expected him to remember these things without needing to write them down, or maybe she feels it's an invasion of privacy.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, his actions were well-intentioned. He wanted to remember things to be a good partner. However, he didn't consider how his wife might perceive it. The key here is communication. The author didn't discuss this with his wife beforehand, so he didn't realize it might make her uncomfortable. The fact that she's upset now might be because it changed her perception of his gestures. Even if he didn't mean any harm, the effect was negative. \n\nBut then again, keeping a personal record of things she shared with him isn't inherently wrong. People have different ways of showing love. The issue here is more about differing expectations and the lack of communication. The author might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled it differently. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but he needs to address the situation by talking to her and understanding her feelings. The problem isn't the act of keeping the almanac itself but how it's affected their relationship. So the author's intentions are good, but the action led to unintended consequences. Therefore, he's not in the wrong, but he should reflect on how to make it right.\n"
