She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he created a personal almanac with notes about his wife's preferences and other details, which he uses to remember things to do sweet things for her. But his wife found it, felt it was a playbook, and now is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's intention seems genuine. He wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't share it with anyone else, so there's no malice there. He even mentions he doesn't want to be the guy who forgets stuff, which shows he's trying his best to be a good partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed and cheapened. She might feel that the almanac is a calculated way to make her feel appreciated, rather than a genuine effort. Maybe she wanted the spontaneity and sincerity of him remembering things naturally, instead of from a list. It's possible she felt like he was treating her as a project or using the notes to gain brownie points, even if that wasn't his intention.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything intentionally hurtful. He kept it private, and his actions were motivated by love. However, he might not have considered how she would perceive it. Maybe he should have discussed it with her before, to understand her feelings towards such gestures. The problem here is the lack of communication, not the act itself. So, the fault might not be entirely his, but there's room for discussion on both sides.\n\nIn terms of AITA, usually the community looks for intent and impact. The impact here is real (she's hurt), but the intent was good. The answer might depend on whether the method (keeping the list) was appropriate. Some might say that the method was okay, others that it's a personal boundary issue. But since he didn't do it to harm her, and it was meant to be a good thing, the author is probably not in the wrong. The wife's reaction is valid, but that doesn't make him wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
