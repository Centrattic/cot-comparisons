She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The story is about a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down details about his wife's preferences and interests. His wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like he was using it to manipulate the sweet things he does for her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The husband's intention was genuine\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't show it to anyone and kept it as a personal reference. The wife's reaction is based on feeling that this practice cheapened his gestures, implying that she thought he wasn't doing those things sincerely but was following a script.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants to know my perspective. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's actions were well-meaning and done out of love. He didn't intend to manipulate or deceive; he just wanted to be a better partner by remembering her likes. On the other hand, the wife felt that the existence of the notebook made her feel like he wasn't being authentic, that his gestures were premeditated and not from the heart. \n\nTrust and communication are important in relationships. The husband didn't hide his intentions, but he didn't discuss it with her either. Perhaps he should have talked to her about why he kept the notebook, to explain that it was a genuine expression of his feelings rather than a calculated approach. However, the fact that he didn't share it doesn't necessarily make it wrong. He didn't misuse the information or act in a deceitful way.\n\nThe wife's feelings are valid. If she feels that his actions were insincere, that's a legitimate emotional response. But the husband's intent was to show love and care. The problem here might be a communication gap. The husband didn't realize how his actions could be perceived, and the wife didn't express her feelings about it until she found the notebook.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's actions were not malicious. He was trying to be a thoughtful partner. The issue is more about differing perspectives on sincerity versus effort. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because his intentions were good, even if the outcome caused hurt feelings due to a lack of communication.\n"
