She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who created an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and memories to remember her better. His wife found out, felt betrayed, and is upset because she thought he remembered these things naturally. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The husband made the notes to remember the things his wife told him, which he didn't want to forget. He didn't share it with anyone and never showed it to her. His motivation seems genuine\u2014trying to be a better partner by remembering her likes and dislikes.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction is valid. She might have felt that the notes were a \"playbook,\" implying that he wasn't truly engaging with her but rather using a list. Trust and emotional connection are important in relationships. If she felt that his actions were inauthentic, even if his intentions were good, that could lead to hurt feelings. \n\nThe key points here are consent and transparency. The husband kept the Almanac a secret, which his wife didn't expect. She might have appreciated being told about it earlier, especially since she values authenticity. However, his actions were meant to show love and effort. \n\nIs it wrong to keep a personal notebook? Not inherently. But the lack of communication about it might have caused the issue. The husband didn't consider that his wife might have different feelings about being documented. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because his intentions were good. However, the situation highlights a communication gap. The answer here is B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong. The problem might be more about their communication rather than the act itself.\n"
