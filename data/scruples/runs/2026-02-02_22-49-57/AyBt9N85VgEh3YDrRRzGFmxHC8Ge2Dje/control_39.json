She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of his wife's preferences. So, the key here is understanding the dynamics between the couple. The author created this notebook to remember all the little details about his wife, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she felt betrayed and thought it was a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine effort. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind the Almanac. The author's intention was to remember things so he could show his love and make her feel special. That seems positive. But the wife's reaction is important here. She felt like her personal information was being used as a strategy, which made her uncomfortable. The issue might be about privacy and trust. Even if the intention was good, maybe she didn't expect him to keep such a detailed record. \n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't ask her if keeping the Almanac was okay. He did it on his own, so she might feel he didn't respect her boundaries. People have different comfort levels with how their personal info is handled. Even if he meant well, not discussing it with her first could be a mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction might be overblown. The author was trying to be thoughtful, and the Almanac was a way to show his love. But the wife's feelings of betrayal suggest that the method of keeping track wasn't the issue, but how it made her feel. Maybe she felt like he was treating their relationship as something transactional, using notes to \"play the game\" instead of being authentic.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. If the wife's feelings are valid and their communication has broken down, then maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the fact that the wife feels hurt and betrayed is significant. The author should have considered her perspective and perhaps discussed the idea with her before keeping such a detailed record. In relationships, transparency and mutual consent on such matters are important. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is more about differing perspectives and communication issues. Alternatively, if the act of keeping the Almanac without discussing it first is considered a breach of trust, then maybe A. But the key here is that the author's intent was positive, and the issue is more about the wife's reaction. Since the question is whether the author is wrong, and he didn't have malicious intent, I think the answer is B. The problem is more about their communication than the action itself.\n"
