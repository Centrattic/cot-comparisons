She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who wrote down all sorts of personal details about his wife in a book he calls \"The Almanac.\" He started doing this because he didn't want to forget the little things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs. Over the years, he's filled it with her favorites and stuff he wants to remember to do sweet things for her.\n\nNow, his wife found the book and got upset. She called it a \"playbook\" and felt cheapened by his sweet gestures. She's upset, and he's confused because he thought this was a good thing. The question is whether he's in the wrong or not.\n\nHmm. Well, the key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife to show his love and care. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. But his wife's reaction is that it feels like he's using a playbook, which makes her feel like his gestures aren't genuine but instead calculated. She might feel that he's not actually paying attention in the moment but is just following a list, which could make her feel like a performance or that he's not truly present.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were meant to be loving. He wanted to remember details that matter to her. On the other hand, the wife's feelings are valid. If she interprets his actions as manipulative or insincere, even if that's not his intention, it's a problem. Trust and authenticity in a relationship are important. The wife might feel that having a list of her preferences makes her feel like she's being cataloged rather than being truly known and loved for who she is.\n\nAnother angle: privacy. The author didn't tell her about the Almanac, which could be seen as keeping something important private. Maybe she would have preferred to not have that documented. She might feel that he shouldn't have written down personal things without her knowledge, regardless of the intent. Even if it's well-meaning, keeping such a detailed record without discussing it with her could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nBut then, the author didn't share it with anyone and didn't use it in a negative way. He wanted to remember to be a good partner. However, her reaction shows that she values spontaneity or genuine remembrance over a written list. The problem here is that he didn't consider her perspective\u2014it's not just about his actions but how they affect her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's possible he's not malicious, but he didn't consider that his actions might make her feel that her partner isn't being genuine. The fact that he kept it a secret and didn't discuss it with her might have contributed to her feeling betrayed. Even if his intention was good, the outcome is that his wife is hurt. In relationships, communication is key. He might need to understand that she didn't want her personal details to be written down, even if it's for good reasons.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that he's not in the wrong because he meant well and his actions were a way to show love. But the wrongness here is more about how his actions impacted her, not the intent. If someone feels betrayed or that their feelings are being manipulated, even well-intentioned actions can be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions, while well-intended, caused hurt and made her feel that his gestures were insincere. He should have considered her feelings and discussed his approach with her instead of keeping it a secret.\n"
