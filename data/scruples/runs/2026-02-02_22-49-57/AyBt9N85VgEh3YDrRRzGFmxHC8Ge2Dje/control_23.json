She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for having an almanac of personal notes about their wife.\n\nFirst, the almanac was created to remember important details about the wife, like her favorite things. The author mentions that they started after their first date because they didn't want to forget something the wife loved. The intention seems genuine and loving.\n\nThe problem arose when the wife found the almanac. She felt it was a \"playbook\" and felt betrayed. The author didn't show it to anyone, so they didn't intend to deceive. However, the wife's reaction is strong, indicating that she perceived his actions as inauthentic. \n\nThe key here is understanding the wife's perspective. The author might have thought keeping notes was a way to show love and effort, but the wife might feel that relying on notes instead of genuine memory is insincere. She might value spontaneous, heartfelt actions over planned ones based on a list. \n\nThe author's actions were without malice, but the effect on the wife is significant. The wife's feelings of betrayal suggest that the almanac made her question the authenticity of his gestures. Even if the intention was good, the outcome is that it hurt her. \n\nIn relationships, intentions matter, but so does how actions affect the partner. The author needs to consider that while the almanac was a tool for remembering, the wife might feel it's a crutch that doesn't reflect true effort. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intention, but the action had a negative impact. However, the answer depends on whether the author's actions were wrong despite good intentions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on both intentions and consequences. Since the consequence was significant emotional distress, the author might be in the right to feel they were trying to be considerate, but the wife's feelings are valid. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the intention was good, but the situation is more complex. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) if the action, regardless of intent, hurt the partner. However, the author didn't keep it secret for deceit but to remember. So B makes sense.\n"
