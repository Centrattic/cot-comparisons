She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author created an almanac to remember personal details about his wife, like her favorite things and interests. He did this to show he cares and to do sweet things for her. The problem arose when his wife found the almanac and felt betrayed, thinking it was a \"playbook\" rather than a genuine effort to remember her preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's intention was positive; he wanted to remember her likes to express love. The almanac was a personal, private effort. He didn't share it with anyone, which suggests he didn't mean to use it manipulatively.\n\nNext, the wife's reaction. She felt the almanac cheapened the gestures, implying she might have thought he was being inauthentic or using a list to \"game\" their relationship. This could stem from a lack of trust or misunderstanding about his motives. It's possible she felt her personal details were being cataloged for ulterior motives rather than heartfelt remembrance.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't explain the almanac's purpose before she found it. If he had shared it with her earlier, maybe she would have understood his intentions. Now that it's found, the issue is about perception vs. reality. His actions were well-meaning, but her feelings are valid too. Trust and transparency are important in relationships. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he had no malicious intent. The problem is a miscommunication. He didn't do anything harmful, like keeping secrets to deceive. He made a genuine effort to remember her, which shows care. The fault might lie more in not discussing it beforehand rather than the act itself. \n\nOn the other hand, if she felt betrayed, it's a significant emotional issue. But the author didn't do anything wrong intentionally. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his actions were loving, even if the outcome was unintended. The key is that he didn't act with deceit, and his intent was positive. The wife's reaction is valid, but he's not at fault here.\n"
