She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband keeping an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and memories. The wife is upset that he kept this notebook, feeling it cheapens the sweet things he does for her and that it's like a \"playbook.\" The husband argues he did it out of love, to remember important details, and not to use them in a manipulative way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband created the Almanac to remember his wife's likes and important details because he wanted to be a good partner. He never showed it to anyone and kept it private. However, the wife found out and is hurt, feeling that the notes make her feel like her husband is calculating his gestures instead of genuinely caring. She might see it as a lack of spontaneity or authenticity in his actions.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, his intention was good\u2014to show love and care. But actions can have unintended consequences. The wife's reaction suggests that the existence of the notebook made her feel objectified or that the gestures were not sincere. The concept of \"playbook\" implies she might think he's using a script, which can feel inauthentic. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband didn't discuss his notebook with her, assuming it was a private tool. However, by keeping it a secret, he didn't consider her perspective. Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine effort over planned acts. The husband's actions, while well-intentioned, may have inadvertently caused her to feel uneasy. \n\nIs the husband at fault? Well, he didn't have malicious intent. He wanted to remember things to show love. But he didn't consider how she might perceive the notebook. It's possible he misjudged her feelings about being the subject of a \"playbook,\" even if it was for good reasons. However, since he had no ill intent and the notebook was meant to enhance their relationship, some might argue he's not in the wrong. On the other hand, if his actions caused emotional harm despite good intentions, maybe he is partially at fault for not anticipating her feelings.\n\nIn the \"AITA\" context, the community often considers both intention and impact. If the impact is negative, even with good intentions, the person might be called out. But if the intention was purely positive and the impact is a misunderstanding, the person might be seen as not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the husband's action, though well-meaning, crossed a line by making the wife feel objectified. If so, he might be \"AITA.\" If not, he's not. Since the user thinks the husband isn't in the wrong, I should consider if that's the case here. The husband's actions were meant to show love, but the wife's reaction is valid. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit. However, in relationships, both partners' feelings matter. The husband might need to apologize and understand her feelings, but it's not necessarily his fault. So the answer could be B (No), but there's a middle ground where he needs to address her feelings without being in the wrong entirely.\n"
