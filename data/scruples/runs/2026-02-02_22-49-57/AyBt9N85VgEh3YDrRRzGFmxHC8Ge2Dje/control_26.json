She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with notes about his wife's preferences. The situation is that he started writing down things like her favorite color, restaurants, books, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. Now she feels betrayed, thinking it's a playbook and that he doesn't actually remember the stuff, which has made her upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he's trying to be a thoughtful partner by remembering details he might otherwise forget. The intention seems good\u2014showing love and care. But from his wife's perspective, she might feel that the act of taking notes implies she isn't important enough to be remembered without them, or that he's using them as a script instead of being genuine. There's a sense of betrayal because she expected him to remember naturally, not rely on a written list. \n\nThe key here is the emotional impact. Even if the author's intention was good, if the action caused pain or made his wife feel undervalued, then it's a problem. The fact that she mentioned it's \"cheapened\" every sweet thing he's done suggests that she feels the gestures weren't sincere. Maybe she values the idea that he remembers her without needing a reference. The author didn't mean to hurt her, but the outcome is that she's upset and giving the silent treatment. \n\nAlso, the author didn't mention the almanac to her before, so she didn't know about it. The secrecy might play a role here. Even if it's for a good reason, not discussing such a personal thing could lead to misunderstandings. She might have felt that he didn't trust her or that he's hiding something, even if it's just notes. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the wife expected him to remember things from his memory, and he relied on notes, that's a mismatch in expectations. The author's action, while intended to be loving, didn't take into account her feelings about how he remembers her. Maybe she wanted the personal effort of him committing those details to memory, seeing it as a sign of his attentiveness and love. The existence of the almanac, even if well-intentioned, might make her feel like he's not as present or genuinely remembering her as she hoped. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to remember, but the way he did it (without her knowing) and the resulting impact on her feelings means he made a mistake. He should have communicated his approach to her, maybe explaining that he wanted to remember but needed to write it down to avoid forgetting. That way, she might have understood and not felt that her memories were being reduced to a list. The fact that the wife is upset and the author is causing her distress makes him at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because the action hurt his wife's feelings and he didn't consider her perspective or communicate his intentions.\n"
