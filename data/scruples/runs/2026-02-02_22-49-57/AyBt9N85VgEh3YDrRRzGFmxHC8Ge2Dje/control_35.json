She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the guy wrote an Almanac with all the details about his wife that he wanted to remember. He started because he wanted to be a good husband and remember her favorite things. But when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, calling it a playbook. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, first, he didn't share this with anyone else, and he kept it private. His intention was to remember sweet things to do for her. But from her perspective, maybe she felt that keeping those notes was inauthentic. Like, instead of just naturally remembering, he was using a playbook, which might make her feel like he's not being genuine. \n\nAlso, maybe she felt that if he needed to write it down, he wasn't truly paying attention. The idea of a \"playbook\" suggests that he's using a strategy to win her affection, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if his intent was good, the effect was hurtful. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's trying to remember the things she likes, which is a kind gesture. He didn't mean to make her feel that way. The problem might be communication. He didn't think she'd mind, but her reaction shows that she had a different view. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good, but perhaps he should have discussed it with her instead of keeping it a secret. \n\nWait, the key here is her reaction. If she's upset and feels betrayed, even if his actions were well-meaning, he might be in the wrong for not considering how she'd feel about having her personal details recorded without her knowledge. It's about respecting her boundaries and feelings. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he kept a collection of her personal info without her consent, which made her feel untrusting. Even if it's to remember, she might value the spontaneity and authenticity of his actions. So, he should have been more open about it or found another way to remember without making it feel like a playbook.\n"
