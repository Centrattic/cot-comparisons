She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about \"The Almanac,\" which is a notebook where the husband writes down personal details about his wife, like her favorite things, etc. The wife found it and is upset, feeling betrayed, and thinks it's a playbook rather than a genuine expression of love.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's intention was to remember important details about his wife because he wanted to show his love and not forget things. He didn't tell anyone about it and kept it private. The wife, on the other hand, found it and felt that instead of remembering things naturally, he was just relying on the notebook, which made her feel like his gestures were insincere. She calls it a \"playbook,\" implying he's using it as a strategy to impress her, which she interprets as not truly caring. \n\nSo the main question is whether keeping such a notebook is wrong. Is it about intentions versus perception? The husband's intention is genuine; he wants to remember things he would otherwise forget. But the wife's reaction suggests that she feels the act of writing down these details somehow cheapens the effort. Maybe she values the spontaneous remembrance more than written notes. \n\nAlso, the fact that he kept it a secret might play a role. Even though he didn't share it with others, the secrecy could have led to distrust when she found it. She might have felt like he was hiding something, which could contribute to her sense of betrayal. \n\nBut then, is the husband at fault for wanting to remember things? If someone loves their partner, trying to remember their likes and dislikes is a positive thing. The problem arises in how the wife interpreted it. However, the husband might not have considered that his method of using a notebook could be seen as manipulative or disingenuous. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The husband didn't talk to his wife about the notebook. Maybe if he had shared it with her earlier, explained the purpose, they could have had a conversation about it. Since he kept it private, her discovering it without context might have led to misunderstandings. \n\nBut the original question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's feelings are valid; she feels hurt and betrayed. However, the husband's actions were intended to show love. The key here is whether the method of keeping the notebook crosses a line. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are important. If the husband had discussed his approach with his wife and she was okay with it, that might be different. But since he kept it secret and she found out this way, it's possible that the method of keeping the notes without discussing it contributed to her negative reaction. \n\nHowever, the husband's intention was good. He was trying to be a better partner by remembering things. The problem is more about how the wife perceived it. So is he in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If his actions, though well-intentioned, caused harm because of secrecy, maybe he's partially at fault. But if the issue is purely her interpretation, then he might not be wrong. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often considers both intentions and the impact. If the impact is negative, even with good intentions, it can be seen as the person being in the wrong. But in this case, the wife's reaction might be seen as overreacting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have communicated his actions. The fact that he kept it a secret could be seen as a mistake. But the act of keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on whether the secrecy or the method is the main issue. Since the husband didn't intend to hurt her and was trying to be thoughtful, but the way he did it led to her feeling betrayed, it's possible that he isn't in the wrong. The problem is more on the perception and communication rather than the action itself. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
