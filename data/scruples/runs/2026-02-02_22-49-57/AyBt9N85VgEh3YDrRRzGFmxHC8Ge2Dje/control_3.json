She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he created this \"Almanac\" where he wrote down all sorts of personal details about his wife\u2014her likes, favorites, etc. He did this so he wouldn't forget and could do sweet things for her. But then she found it, and she's upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's using it to manipulate or not genuinely remembering her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intimacy and trust in a relationship. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember things to show his love. But the wife felt betrayed. Even though he didn't share it with anyone, keeping such a detailed record of personal information might have made her feel like her privacy was invaded or that his gestures weren't genuine. \n\nWait, but he wrote it down because he wanted to remember. Isn't that a common way people try to be attentive? Like, if someone writes down their partner's favorite things to make sure they don't forget, isn't that a sign of care? But maybe the problem is that it's a secret. She didn't know about it, and the fact that he kept it hidden made her feel like he wasn't being authentic. \n\nAlso, when she found out, she felt like the sweet things he did were cheapened. Maybe because she thought he was just following a checklist instead of truly caring. Even if his intention was good, maybe the act of keeping an almanac made her feel like he wasn't engaging with her in the moment. \n\nBut is it wrong for him to have done that? Well, the issue is that it's about how the action was perceived. Even if his intention was pure, if his partner feels hurt, then maybe he should have considered her perspective. Perhaps he should have discussed it with her instead of keeping it a secret. Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over prepared gestures. \n\nSo, is he at fault? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, he was trying to be thoughtful. On the other, his wife's feelings are valid. Maybe he didn't mean to make her feel that way, but if his actions led to her feeling betrayed, then maybe he did something wrong. The fact that he was keeping it a secret might be part of the problem. In a healthy relationship, sharing such efforts might be better than hiding them. So maybe he should have talked to her about it earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she overreacted. But her feelings are important too. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife feels betrayed and the action caused harm, then he might be partially wrong for not considering her feelings or not being transparent. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Different people have different views on privacy and relationships. Some might think keeping a notebook is normal, others might find it creepy. So the answer depends on context and communication. Since he didn't mention it to her and she had a negative reaction, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it differently. \n\nBut the question is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. I think the key here is that he didn't have malicious intent, but his actions made his wife feel uncomfortable. So maybe he's not in the wrong (B), but he should have been more open. However, some people might argue that he was wrong for keeping such a detailed record secretly. \n\nAnother angle: if the Almanac was meant to help him remember, then it's a tool for his personal use. But if his wife felt it was a playbook, that's a misunderstanding. The problem is the perception. Since he didn't mean to hurt her but did, it's a matter of whether his actions were inherently wrong. Since he intended to show love, maybe he's not in the wrong. But again, if it's causing her pain, maybe he should have considered her feelings more. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his intentions were good, and his actions were meant to be thoughtful. However, he might need to address her feelings and adjust how he shows love. The mistake was maybe not discussing it with her, but the act itself wasn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
