She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. The key points are that he started this after their first date to remember things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs, favorite colors, etc. He uses it to do sweet things for her, hasn't shown it to anyone, and the wife found it and felt betrayed, thinking it's a playbook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author says he does this because he wants to remember important things about his wife and show he cares. That's a good intention. But the wife is upset. Why? Maybe she feels like he's not remembering on his own, which could make her feel like he's not genuinely paying attention. She might have thought he remembered because he would do sweet things based on her preferences, but if he's relying on notes, maybe she feels he's not making the effort. \n\nAnother angle is privacy. Even though he's keeping the notes to himself, she might not have expected him to document such personal information. It could feel invasive, even if well-meaning. The term \"playbook\" suggests she might think he's treating their relationship like a script, which could imply manipulation. But the author denies that, saying he doesn't do it for brownie points. \n\nCommunication is a big factor here. Did he ever discuss this with her before? If he kept it a secret, maybe she found it surprising and that's part of why she's upset. The way he found her was under a situation where she was at work and maybe in a messy state, but he found her beautiful. The Almanac started as a way to not forget, but her reaction is about feeling cheapened. \n\nIs there a cultural or social norm that considers this behavior inappropriate? Some might see it as a sweet gesture, others as a lack of genuine memory. The wife's feelings are valid; if she feels betrayed, that's a real emotional harm, even if unintended. The author might have to consider that while his intention was good, the action of keeping a detailed notebook without her knowledge might not align with her expectations of privacy or authenticity. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the wife's reaction is about the intent versus the action. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to remember, but maybe for not discussing it with her first. The wife's feelings are important, and the author should respect that. Therefore, it's a no, but with the caveat that he needs to handle the situation by communicating and understanding her perspective. The correct choice is B.\n"
