She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author created an Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down all the things he learns about his wife, like her favorite colors, books, etc. The purpose is to remember these details so he can do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone except his wife, and now when she found it, she's upset because she felt it was a \"playbook\" and that he was using it to manipulate his actions, which made her feel betrayed.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's intentions. He clearly states that he did it out of love, to remember important things about his wife. There's no indication he had any ulterior motives. He didn't show it to anyone and kept it private, so there's no evidence of malice or deceit. His actions were meant to be thoughtful and personal.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife's reaction is based on feeling that the Almanac cheapened the gestures. She might see it as insincere because he's relying on a list instead of genuine memory and spontaneity. The concept of a \"playbook\" suggests a script or a strategy, which could make her feel like his actions are calculated rather than heartfelt. This could lead to a loss of trust or feeling that her partner isn't being authentic.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The problem here is subjective. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but the issue is about how his actions made his wife feel. Even though his intentions were good, the result was hurt feelings. In relationships, intentions matter, but so do the impacts of one's actions. The author might argue that he was trying to be thoughtful, but his wife's perspective is valid as well. She might feel that the Almanac undermines the sincerity of his gestures, making them feel like they're part of a pre-planned list rather than genuine expressions of love.\n\nIt's important to consider cultural or personal norms. Some people might view keeping such a notebook as a sweet and considerate gesture, while others might find it manipulative. The author's wife is in the latter camp. The author's mistake might be not anticipating how she would perceive it. Even though he didn't intend to make her feel that way, the existence of the Almanac did cause her emotional distress. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't discuss the Almanac with his wife before, which might have led to misunderstandings. If he had shared his approach earlier, perhaps she would have been more accepting. However, since he kept it a secret, her discovery of it might have felt like a breach of trust or an attempt to control the relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his intentions were good and there's no malicious intent. However, the fact that his actions caused his wife emotional harm means that he needs to address her feelings. The answer here might hinge on whether the wrong lies in the action itself (which is debatable) or in the failure to communicate and consider his partner's perspective.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong in a right-or-wrong sense, but he needs to acknowledge his wife's feelings and perhaps adjust his approach to be more in line with her expectations. The answer would likely be B (No) because he didn't act with malicious intent, but the situation is more about differing perspectives and communication issues rather than a clear case of being wrong.\n"
