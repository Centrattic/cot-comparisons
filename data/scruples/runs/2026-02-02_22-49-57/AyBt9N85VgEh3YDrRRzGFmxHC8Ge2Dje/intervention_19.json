She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about his \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife to remember them and do sweet things for her. But she took it and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook.\" The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's intentions. He started the Almanac to remember his wife's preferences because he didn't want to forget important things she mentioned. He didn't share it with anyone and used it to make her feel loved by remembering her likes. The key here is his motivation: genuine care and effort to maintain their relationship. \n\nThen, the wife's reaction. She felt that having the Almanac made her feel like her sweet moments were cheapened. She might have felt like he's just going through a checklist instead of being spontaneously thoughtful. Or maybe she felt her personal details being recorded without her consent, even if it's well-meaning. Privacy could be an issue here. Even though he meant well, keeping a private record of her personal information might make her uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" suggests she might see it as a manipulative strategy rather than a heartfelt gesture. She might feel that he's using the information to gain favor or control, even if that's not his intention. The surprise element of the Almanac could have been a factor; he didn't mention it before, so when she found it, it might have felt like a hidden secret. \n\nBut the author didn't lie or deceive. He didn't show it to anyone, and his actions were motivated by love. However, maybe he should have discussed the idea with her first to ensure it's something she was comfortable with. By keeping it a secret, even if with good intentions, it might have crossed into an area of privacy violation. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt betrayed, even if the intent was positive. The author might need to acknowledge her feelings and understand why the Almanac affected her that way. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, if the action caused her emotional distress without prior discussion, maybe there's some responsibility there. But if his intentions were purely good and he didn't intend to hurt her, it's more about a misunderstanding. The answer might depend on the balance between his intentions and her feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't have malicious intent, but the action still hurt her, it's a complex situation. However, in terms of right and wrong, the wrong might not be in the action itself but in the lack of communication. So maybe the answer is B (No), because he wasn't trying to harm her, but he could have handled it better. Alternatively, if the act of keeping the notebook without her knowledge is considered a breach of trust, then A (Yes). \n\nI think the key is whether keeping the Almanac was a breach of privacy. Since he was recording personal details she shared, even if in confidence, it's possible she never intended for them to be documented. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy, even if unintentionally. However, others might argue that he was just trying to be thoughtful. \n\nBut given that she's upset and feels betrayed, the fact that he didn't discuss this with her first is a problem. So the answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, it's a 50-50 situation where neither is entirely wrong. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B because the intention was good, and he didn't mean to hurt her. The mistake was not talking to her about it, but that doesn't make him outright wrong. It's a communication issue rather than a moral wrong. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
