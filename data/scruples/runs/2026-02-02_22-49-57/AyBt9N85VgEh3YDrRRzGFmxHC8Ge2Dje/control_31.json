She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author in the given AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The story is about a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and personal details. He never showed it to anyone and used it to remember things for sweet gestures. However, when his wife found it, she felt betrayed and upset, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapened his intentions. The author is wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember his wife's likes to be a considerate partner. He kept it private, which suggests he didn't mean to manipulate or use it for anything underhanded. On the other hand, the wife's reaction is valid. She might have felt that her personal information was being stored without her consent, even if it was with good intentions. Privacy is important in relationships, and not discussing such a detailed notebook could lead to misunderstandings. The wife might have perceived it as an invasion of her privacy or as insincere gestures if she felt he was just using the notes to appear attentive rather than truly being present and remembering naturally.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The husband didn't inform her about the notebook, so she discovered it unexpectedly. This lack of communication could have led to her feeling betrayed. Even if his intentions were pure, the act of keeping a secret about such a personal document might have been a mistake. In relationships, transparency is important. The wife might have preferred him to remember things without needing to write them down, or at least to have discussed it with her before keeping such detailed notes.\n\nHowever, the husband's actions were not malicious. He was trying to be a thoughtful partner. The problem here might be more about differing expectations and a lack of communication rather than an intentional wrongdoing. The wife's feelings are valid, but the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because his motives were good. However, the way he handled the situation (keeping it a secret) could have been better. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn AITA judgments, the focus is often on whether the person's actions were unreasonable or if they overstepped. In this case, the husband's actions were well-meaning but perhaps naive in terms of not considering his wife's perspective on privacy. The fact that she felt the need to call it a \"playbook\" suggests she felt manipulated, even if that wasn't the intention. So, while he's not outright in the wrong, he might be at least partially responsible for not discussing it with her. The answer might lean towards B (No), but with the caveat that there's room for improvement in communication. However, since the answer must be just A or B, I need to decide based on whether he's in the wrong. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, and his intentions were good but the action led to harm, it's tricky. The wife's reaction is valid, but the husband's actions, while perhaps ill-advised, don't make him the asshole. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
