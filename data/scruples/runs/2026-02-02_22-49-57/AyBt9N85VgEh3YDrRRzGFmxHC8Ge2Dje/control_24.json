She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac where he wrote down personal details about his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author started keeping notes on his wife's preferences to remember them and do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone and kept it private. But now his wife feels betrayed, thinking it's a playbook, and is upset. \n\nSo, the key points are: the intention was to remember things he loves about her, he kept it private, but she feels like it's inauthentic or manipulative. The question is whether he was in the wrong by keeping this notebook.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he wanted to show his love and effort by remembering details. His wife's reaction is feeling that it's insincere, maybe like he's using a script. \n\nIs keeping notes inherently wrong? Well, people often take notes to remember important information. If the intention was good, maybe it's not wrong. But the wife's feelings are valid. Maybe she felt that the notes were a facade, making her feel like he wasn't naturally remembering things but relying on a list. \n\nThere's a cultural aspect here. Some might see note-taking as a genuine effort to be attentive, others might see it as inauthentic. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling that her partner isn't truly present or attentive without the notes. \n\nAlso, the author kept it a secret. Maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier. If he had shared his intentions, maybe she would have understood. But he didn't, and now she's upset. \n\nThe author's defense is that he wanted to remember, but maybe his wife felt that using a notebook was a crutch rather than genuine effort. The line between effort and manipulation can be thin. \n\nIn relationships, trust and feelings are key. Even if his intention was good, if it made her feel that his gestures were inauthentic, then maybe there's a problem. The fact that she's considering destroying it shows how hurt she is. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's possible he wasn't, because his intention was good, but he didn't consider how it might be perceived. However, actions have consequences, and not discussing it with her could be a mistake. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their relationship. However, since the wife is feeling betrayed and the author's actions led to that, maybe he's at fault for not considering her perspective earlier. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes) because he should have communicated his intentions better.\n"
