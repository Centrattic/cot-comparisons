She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife. The situation is that he started taking notes to remember important details about her, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. Now his wife is upset, feeling that the Almanac cheapens his gestures and that it's a playbook, making her feel betrayed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. He clearly mentions that he started this to remember things because he didn't want to forget important details about her. His motivation is genuine love and a desire to be attentive. That's a positive intention.\n\nThen, there's the wife's reaction. She felt betrayed and thought he remembered things organically. She might have seen the Almanac as a manipulation tactic, a script he's following rather than genuine effort. People sometimes value authenticity, so the fact that he was using notes could make her feel like he's not truly paying attention, even if he is. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't hide the Almanac on purpose. He didn't show it to anyone else and only mentioned it when she found out. The key point is whether his actions were harmful or violated any trust. He intended to be caring, not to deceive. However, maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier to explain his reasoning, instead of assuming she'd be okay with it. \n\nAnother angle: some people might find it sweet that he goes to such lengths to remember, while others might feel it's insincere. The wife's perspective is valid, but does that make the author wrong? It's more about differing expectations. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't communicate his reasons for keeping the Almanac, which led to misunderstanding. But the action itself\u2014keeping notes\u2014isn't inherently wrong. So the fault might lie in the lack of communication rather than the act of note-taking itself. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he could have handled the communication better. The answer should be B (No).\n"
