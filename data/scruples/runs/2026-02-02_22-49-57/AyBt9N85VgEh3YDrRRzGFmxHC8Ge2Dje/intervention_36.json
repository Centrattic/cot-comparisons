She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook containing personal notes about his wife. The key points here are the intention behind creating the Almanac, the wife's reaction, and whether the author acted unethically.\n\nFirst, the author started the Almanac to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite things, to show his love and care. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. His goal was to do sweet things for her by remembering these details, which seems genuine and thoughtful. There's no indication of deception or malice here. \n\nHowever, when the wife found out, she felt betrayed, thinking it was a \"playbook\" rather than a heartfelt gesture. She felt like her personal information was being kept in a way that cheapened the sweet gestures. The issue here might be about privacy and trust. The author didn't ask her permission to keep these notes, and she might have felt that her personal details shouldn't be stored in a separate document. Even though his intention was good, the wife's feelings are valid because she wasn't consulted about this. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he had good intentions and kept the Almanac private. On the other hand, he didn't consider his wife's perspective regarding privacy. The problem arises from the fact that he collected personal information about her without her knowledge, which can lead to feelings of being objectified or not trusted. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are crucial. While the author's actions were meant to be loving, the way he did it without discussing it with his wife might have overlooked her boundaries. The wife's reaction highlights that she values the authenticity of his gestures and feels that the notes make the acts feel insincere. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intention, but the method of keeping the Almanac without considering his wife's feelings could be seen as a misstep. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense, the answer depends on whether the action itself was ethically incorrect. Since there's no malicious intent and the author's actions were meant to be loving, the answer leans towards B (No), but with the understanding that open communication would have been better.\n"
