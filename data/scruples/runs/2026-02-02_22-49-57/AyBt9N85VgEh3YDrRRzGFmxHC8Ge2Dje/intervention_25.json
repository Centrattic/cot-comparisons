She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story did something wrong by keeping an almanac of their wife's preferences. The situation is that the wife found out about the notebook and is upset, feeling betrayed and saying it's a \"playbook.\" The author feels they are trying to remember things they love about her and are confused why it's a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The almanac started as notes to remember small details about the wife, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. The wife found the book, which was a secret the author kept. She's upset because she thought he should remember these things naturally, not rely on a written list. The author didn't share it with anyone else, so it's personal. The wife is considering destroying it and is distant now.\n\nNow, to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the secret. Did keeping the almanac in secret cross a line? The author's intention was to remember and do nice things, but the wife feels it's manipulative. Maybe she values genuine, spontaneous remembrance rather than something documented. Secrets in relationships can be sensitive, even if well-intentioned. If the author had shared it earlier, maybe the reaction would have been different. The wife might also feel that the notes are a way to control the relationship, hence the term \"playbook.\" \n\nBut the author's actions were to show love and effort. They didn't use the almanac to manipulate or deceive but to help remember. The problem is that the wife didn't know about it and felt it was a betrayal. So, the wrong here is more on the wife's reaction, or maybe the author's secrecy. The question is whether the author's actions, despite good intentions, were wrong because they were done without transparency. \n\nIn relationships, sharing personal things can be expected in some contexts. If the wife felt that the notes were meant to be kept private and he didn't tell her, maybe it's a breach of trust. But the author didn't intend to hide it; they just didn't mention it. The wife's feelings of betrayal are strong. It's possible the almanac made her feel like he's keeping a scorecard or planning things rather than being genuine. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. The author's intention was positive, but the action of keeping it a secret might have been unwise. Relationships require communication, and if the wife didn't know about the almanac, the secrecy might be the issue. On the other hand, the wife's reaction is also valid because she expected him to remember things naturally. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to remember, but the lack of communication could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the almanac is a good gesture, but the way the wife found out (suddenly during a call) and her interpretation of it as a playbook is the issue. The author didn't use the almanac to hurt her, but the secrecy might have led to her feeling unvalued. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key point is the secrecy. If he had mentioned it, maybe she would have been okay. But since he kept it a secret, even if it's just for personal use, it could be seen as a lack of trust. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being open about it. However, the wife might be overreacting. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. The intention was to preserve memories, not to deceive. The wife's feelings are valid, but the action itself isn't malicious. The author should explain their intent, though. So the answer is B, no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
