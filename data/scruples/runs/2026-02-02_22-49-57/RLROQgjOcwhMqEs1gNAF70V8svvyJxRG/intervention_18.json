He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife's ability to manage household tasks and her own work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement for his office because of the view. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife has to keep the kids from disturbing him. This restriction affects her ability to use the top floor, including showering, doing chores, etc. The wife works from home too and handles most household responsibilities. She suggested the basement for his office, which is more suitable for silence. The husband, however, insists on staying in the bedroom, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author (wife) is not in the wrong, but they want to confirm. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nConsidering typical workplace setups and shared living spaces, it's reasonable for the wife to expect her husband to choose a space that minimizes disruption, especially since the basement is available and would solve the problem. The husband's preference for the view seems less critical compared to the practical needs of the household. The wife is trying to balance work and family responsibilities, and the husband's choice is hindering her ability to do so. \n\nThe husband's job is 90% conference calls, so he needs a quiet environment. However, the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which is quieter, makes sense. His refusal to move might be seen as not considering her needs. The wife isn't being unreasonably loud; she's managing kids and chores, which are typical family duties. The husband's setup is causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nIn such scenarios, compromise is usually expected. Since the basement is an option that would prevent disturbances, the husband's choice might be seen as self-centered. The wife isn't in the wrong for not guaranteeing silence in a space that he's chosen despite knowing it's not ideal. Therefore, the answer is likely B.\n"
