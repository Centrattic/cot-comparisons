He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in their bedroom even though the wife suggested the basement. Now, when he's working from the bedroom, especially on conference calls, the wife can't do her chores or take care of the kids without disturbing him. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. The husband says she's the asshole for not keeping quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The husband chose the bedroom despite the basement being an option, which the wife had suggested. By setting up in the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to use the space they share. The wife is making a reasonable compromise by saying she can't guarantee silence but is trying to manage the kids. The husband is now holding her to an impossible standard, expecting silence when he chose the location. \n\nI think the wife's stance is valid. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom affects her daily life significantly. The wife is trying to balance work, chores, and kids, which is a lot. The husband should have considered the impact of his choice. By not moving to the basement, he's the one creating the problem. The author (the wife) is not in the wrong because she's standing up for her needs and the practicality of the situation. The husband is the one who should have compromised. So the answer should be B.\n"
