He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who set up his home office in the bedroom instead of the basement. The author, who is the wife, works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She had suggested the basement for his office because it would be quieter, but he chose the bedroom for the better view. Now, she can't use the bathroom, shower, do chores, etc., when he's on calls because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She told him that if he's in the basement, she can guarantee he's undisturbed, but if he stays in the bedroom, she can't. He's saying she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the one being unreasonable for not moving to the basement. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a job that requires him to be on conference calls, so he needs a quiet environment. Choosing the bedroom might be for the view, but if there's a better space available in the basement, maybe he's being a bit selfish. The wife works from home too and handles the majority of the housework and childcare. Her space is being taken over by his office, limiting her ability to do basic tasks. The author's reasoning is that she can't control the noise if he's in the bedroom, so she's not at fault for not keeping the environment quiet there. The husband, on the other hand, is expecting her to manage the household in a way that doesn't interrupt his work, but if he's in a space that's shared (the bedroom), it's harder for her to do that without compromising her own needs.\n\nThe key points here are about shared spaces and responsibilities. The husband's choice to use the main living area (bedroom) for his office creates conflicts in a home where both are working and taking care of kids. The wife is being asked to sacrifice her own needs and ability to work by not having control over the environment where he's working. The husband, by choosing a space that's part of the shared living area, is contributing to the problem. The wife isn't wrong for not promising silence because the setup is impractical. She's trying to balance work and family, and his choice is making it harder for her. So, it seems like the husband is more at fault here for not considering the practical implications of his office location. The author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up for her own needs and the reality of the situation.\n"
