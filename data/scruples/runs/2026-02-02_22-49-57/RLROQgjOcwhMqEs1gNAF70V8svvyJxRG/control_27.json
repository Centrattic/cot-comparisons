He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing the wife to have to manage the kids and household tasks while he's on calls. The wife suggested the basement instead, but he prefers the bedroom for the view.\n\nSo, the author is the wife. She's saying that by not keeping him undisturbed, she's the one in the wrong? Wait, no. The title is \"AITA for not keeping my husband undisturbed...\" So she's the one who's not keeping him undisturbed. The question is whether she's at fault for not doing that.\n\nThe husband chose to set up in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. He's expecting her to manage the kids and the household to keep him undisturbed. But she's the one working from home too and handling most of the chores and kids. She can't even use the bathroom or shower when he's on calls.\n\nThe key points here: He's the one who chose the location. She offered an alternative (basement) which would avoid the conflicts. He declined. Now, she's being blamed for not keeping him undisturbed. But is that her responsibility? If he's in the bedroom, which is a shared space, maybe it's reasonable to expect that his work setup is causing her inconvenience. She's trying to balance work and home, but his choice is making it harder. \n\nThe husband's job is mostly conference calls, so maybe he needs a quiet space. But by choosing the bedroom, he's encroaching on the wife's personal space and her ability to work and take care of the house. The wife is offering a solution (basement) that would prevent the problem, but he's not taking it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's the one who caused the issue by not choosing the basement. The wife is trying to manage the situation but is being blamed for not preventing disruptions. Since he's the one who set up the office where it's causing the problem, he's probably more at fault. The wife isn't in the wrong because she's being reasonable and trying to help, but he's choosing a setup that creates the conflict. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
