He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom even though the wife suggested the basement. Now, when he's working, especially on conference calls, the wife has to keep the kids away, which limits her ability to use the top floor for showers, chores, etc. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him that if he's in the basement, she can guarantee he won't be disturbed, but in the bedroom, she can't. Now they're arguing about who's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. His job involves a lot of calls, which require silence. The wife is handling most of the household responsibilities and her work, which is hindered by his setup. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The user already thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants to confirm. \n\nThe husband's choice to work from the bedroom affects the wife's ability to do her job and manage chores. The wife's objection is about the disruption caused by the kids and her own needs. She's trying to balance both her work and the household, which is a lot. \n\nSetting up in the basement would minimize disruption, so by choosing the bedroom, he's causing a conflict. The wife is reasonable in pointing out that his choice affects her. She's not promising silence because of the kids, which is a valid point. The husband is upset because he wants undisturbed work time, but he's the one who made the choice that leads to the problem. \n\nSo, the wife isn't wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in the bedroom because it's his decision to be there. The husband's choice creates the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
