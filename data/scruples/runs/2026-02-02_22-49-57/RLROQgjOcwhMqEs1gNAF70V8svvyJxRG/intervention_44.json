He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing the wife to have to manage everything else without being able to do her own tasks. The wife suggested moving the office to the basement but he chose the bedroom because of the view. The husband is on conference calls, so she can't disturb him. But she feels it's unfair because she's handling most of the housework and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom was his preference for the view. But the wife is managing the household and her ability to work and do chores is being restricted. The key point here is about mutual consideration and compromise. When setting up a home office, especially when someone else is working from home too, it's important to consider each other's needs.\n\nThe wife offered a solution (basement) that would minimize disruption. He rejected it, possibly prioritizing his comfort over her ability to function. The husband's work requires minimal setup, but the wife's tasks are more about daily living and household management. It's a conflict between personal preference and practicality. Since the basement option was available and would reduce conflict, the husband's choice might not be fair. The wife isn't obligated to constantly adjust her life to his preferences, especially when it impacts her well-being and work. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
