He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home. The husband set up his office in the bedroom despite the basement being available. The author is handling most of the childcare and housework, and his setup is causing her to have limited privacy and ability to do her own work or chores.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom for his office despite the basement option. The basement would have been quieter, but he prefers the view. That seems like a personal choice that affects the household dynamics. The author is left managing the kids and household tasks, which are already a lot, and his location is making it harder for her to manage her own responsibilities and self-care.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility. The husband should consider that setting up in the bedroom creates more disruption for the author. The author, on the other hand, is trying to balance her own work and chores. She's not promising silence in the bedroom, which is a fair point because she's also dealing with kids and housework. The husband is upset because he wants quiet during calls, but he could have chosen the basement to avoid this conflict. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she's being honest about the constraints of her situation. The husband made a choice that complicates her life, and she's standing her ground by pointing out the consequences. It's a matter of communication and compromise, but the initial fault lies with the husband for not considering the impact of his choice. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
