He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife's ability to manage the household and work from home.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The basement is described as having adequate space and being quieter, which would minimize disruptions. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is a lot, and his setup in the bedroom is limiting her ability to use the top floor, including basic tasks like showering or taking a nap.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and consideration. The husband has the option to work in a different space where his work doesn't interfere as much with the wife's responsibilities. The wife is honest about her limitations\u2014she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. The husband, on the other hand, is expecting her to manage the household without disruptions, which might not be feasible if he's in a shared space.\n\nI think the husband is in the wrong here because he's not considering the practical impact of his choice on his wife. Setting up in the basement would solve the problem, but he chose not to. The wife is being reasonable by not making promises she can't keep. So the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
