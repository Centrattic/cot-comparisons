He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom and the wife feeling restricted because of it. \n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement. The wife then can't use the bathroom, do chores, etc., when he's on calls. The wife works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She's saying she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, and the husband is upset with her for not being quiet.\n\nI need to figure out if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The husband made a choice that affects the wife's daily life. The wife is trying to communicate her needs by suggesting the basement, but he didn't take it. Now, she's standing her ground that she can't restrict her life for his work setup. \n\nThe husband's job is 90% conference calls, so he needs silence. But the wife's job and responsibilities also require space and time. The problem is that he's in the bedroom, which is a shared space, so expecting silence there might be unrealistic. The wife is asserting her right to use the space as well. \n\nThe husband's argument is that she's not being quiet, but by setting up in the bedroom, he's creating a situation where he needs others to restrict their activities. The wife is saying she can't do that, which is reasonable. She's trying to balance both their needs. \n\nSo, I think the wife is not in the wrong because she's asserting her needs and the husband should have considered the shared space implications. The answer would be B.\n"
