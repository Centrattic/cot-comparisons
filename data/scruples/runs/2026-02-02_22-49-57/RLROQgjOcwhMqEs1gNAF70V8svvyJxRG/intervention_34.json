He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about their husband setting up his office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions because he's on conference calls. The author tried to suggest the basement, but he prefers the better view. Now, the author can't do basic things like shower or take a nap when he's working from the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is working from home, which is important. But the author is also working from home and handling most of the household chores and kids. If he's in the bedroom, it's restricting her access to the top floor, making her life harder. The husband has the option to work from the basement, which is quieter and avoids these issues, but he chose the bedroom for the view. \n\nThe key point here is that the husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing significant inconvenience to the author. The author is not making a demand but is setting a boundary. She's saying that if he's in the basement, she can guarantee no disturbances, but if he stays in the bedroom, she can't control the noise from the kids or her own activities. The husband is upset because she's not keeping it quiet, but she's arguing that his choice is the problem.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband should consider that his location affects the author's ability to work and manage the household. The basement is available and would prevent these conflicts. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where his work interferes with her responsibilities. The author is not in the wrong because she's trying to balance both their needs and is setting reasonable boundaries. The husband, on the other hand, is not compromising and is causing unnecessary stress on the author. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
