He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home. The husband set up his office in their bedroom, even though the basement was available. The author feels that he should move there to avoid disrupting her and their routine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband works from home a few days a week and chose the bedroom for the better view. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The author is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is being affected by his setup. She suggested the basement, which has more space and would guarantee silence. She told him she can't promise silence if he stays in the bedroom, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not agreeing to keep the bedroom undisturbed. The main issue here is about shared space and mutual accommodations. The husband is using the bedroom for work, which is a shared space, and his choice impacts the author's ability to manage household tasks. The husband isn't using the available space in the basement, which would have minimized disruptions.\n\nTypically, in a shared living space, both parties should make reasonable accommodations. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to conflicts. The author is working from home as well and handling most chores, so her needs are also valid. The husband could have chosen the basement to avoid disrupting the author, but he prioritized his view. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because the husband's decision creates the problem. He should have considered the practicality of the setup. The answer should be B.\n"
