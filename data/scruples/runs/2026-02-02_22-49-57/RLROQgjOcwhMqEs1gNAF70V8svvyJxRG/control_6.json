He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their husband's setup for working from home.\n\nFirst, the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which the wife suggested. The main issue is that when he's on conference calls, the wife can't use the top floor, including showering, doing chores, etc., because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She also mentions that she works from home and handles most house duties. The husband refuses to move to the basement for the view, and she's telling him they can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but would be quiet in the basement. Now they're in a fight.\n\nI need to determine if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The key factors here are the husband's choice to place his office in a shared space (the bedroom) despite a better alternative (basement) existing. The wife is setting boundaries about her own needs and responsibilities. The husband's setup is causing her significant inconvenience, affecting her work and household tasks. The wife's response is to say she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which seems fair because she can't control others' behavior in that space. The husband's insistence on the better view seems prioritizing personal comfort over practicality and the wife's needs.\n\nThe question is about who is at fault. The wife isn't the one creating the situation by choosing the basement; it's the husband's decision. She's trying to assert her needs, which is reasonable. So, the author (the wife) isn't wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
