He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband working from home in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the wife who also works and handles most chores. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. The key points here are the impact on the wife's ability to do her job and household tasks, the husband's preference for the view, and the compromise that the wife offered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband's job requires being on conference calls, so he needs a quiet space. The wife, who also works and manages the household, is being restricted from using the top floor when he's working. The basement is available but he chose the bedroom. The wife told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is a reasonable stance because she can't control the kids or her own needs. \n\nThe husband is upset that she's not being quiet, but he's the one who chose a location that's problematic. The wife is trying to maintain a balance, but his choice is causing issues. The question is whether she's wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. \n\nI think the husband's decision to work in the bedroom, despite the alternative, is the root of the problem. The wife is not at fault for not creating a silent environment when he's in a space that isn't optimal. She's also handling a lot of responsibilities. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
