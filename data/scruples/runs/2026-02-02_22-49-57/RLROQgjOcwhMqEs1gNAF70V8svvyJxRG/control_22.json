He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves her husband working from home in their bedroom, causing her a lot of inconvenience. She suggested he move to the basement, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she's stuck managing the kids and chores without being able to use the bathroom or take a nap when he's on calls.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife works from home too and handles most of the household and kids. She can't use the top floor when he's on calls, which includes the bathroom. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, so he should move to the basement where they promised not to disturb him.\n\nThe main question is whether the wife is in the wrong for not letting him stay in the bedroom. From a fairness perspective, the husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to significant restrictions for the wife. The basement option would allow him to work undisturbed while she can use the top floor. By not moving, he's creating a conflict that affects her ability to work and manage the household. \n\nThe wife's responsibility for the kids and chores is a big factor. If the husband is in the bedroom, she can't use that space, which is a major inconvenience. The husband is being asked to make a small adjustment (moving to the basement) for the greater good of the household balance. The wife is not being unreasonable in her request; she's trying to maintain her own work and responsibilities. The husband's refusal might be seen as selfish, prioritizing his comfort over her needs. \n\nHowever, maybe the husband has a valid reason for preferring the bedroom. But the wife's side has more constraints. The fact that the basement is available and adequate suggests that moving there is feasible. The wife isn't asking him to leave during calls but to avoid a situation where her use of the space is restricted. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife isn't in the wrong. She's trying to create a balance where both can work, and the husband's choice is causing the problem. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
