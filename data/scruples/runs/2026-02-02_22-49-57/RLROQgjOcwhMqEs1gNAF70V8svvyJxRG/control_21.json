He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the wife. The husband works from home part-time, and since his job is mostly conference calls, he needs silence. The wife feels that by setting up in the bedroom, he's making her responsible for keeping the kids and others quiet, which limits her ability to use the top floor, take care of chores, and even take a break when the baby is sleeping. She suggested the basement, which has more space and would be quieter, but he prefers the bedroom for the view.\n\nSo, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong for not allowing him to have a quiet workspace in the bedroom. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's perspective: he chose the bedroom for better view and maybe proximity to the family for some reason. But his job requires silence, so if he's in the bedroom, the family has to be quiet. The wife is handling most of the house chores and childcare, and his choice limits her ability to use the top floor. She's working from home too, so she needs that space. The basement is available, but he refuses to use it. \n\nThe key issues here are about shared space in a home, responsibilities, and mutual accommodations. When you work from home, setting up an office in a less disruptive area is common. The husband's choice affects the wife's ability to function, especially since she's juggling work and home duties. The wife is asking for mutual respect and consideration. If he's in the bedroom, expecting silence, but she can't access her own bathroom, shower, or do chores, that's a problem. The wife's argument is that he should have chosen the basement to avoid conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband's preference for the view is a valid reason, but it's his job that requires the quiet. If he's the one who needs the quiet for work, it's more reasonable for him to relocate to a space that minimizes disruption. The wife isn't being disruptive per se, but the presence of the kids and household activities is natural. By choosing the bedroom, he's putting the burden on her to manage the household without using that area. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, mutual respect means considering each other's workspaces and responsibilities. The husband's job doesn't require him to stay in the bedroom, and the basement is a better option. The wife is right to ask him to use the basement if it ensures her ability to work and manage the home. So, the wife isn't in the wrong for not guaranteeing silence if he's in a space that's not conducive to quiet. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
