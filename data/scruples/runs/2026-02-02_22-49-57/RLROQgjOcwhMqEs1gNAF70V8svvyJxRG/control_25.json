He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong regarding their husband setting up his office in the bedroom. The husband works from home a few days a week, prefers the bedroom because of the view, and the wife is struggling because she can't use the top floor when he's on calls. She suggested the basement, which he refused, and now she's not keeping the bedroom undisturbed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The wife's argument is that by choosing the bedroom, he's causing her to have to manage the house and kids while being restricted from using the space. She's taking on most of the household chores and childcare. The husband is upset that she can't be quiet when he's working there. \n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and consideration. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom limits the wife's ability to function normally in her own home. She's trying to balance work, chores, and kids. The husband's choice of workspace leads to a situation where the wife can't use the top floor, which is part of her home too. \n\nThe wife isn't wrong for setting boundaries. She's explaining that she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a valid point because managing a household with kids is unpredictable. The husband, on the other hand, chose a location that complicates her responsibilities. The wife is trying to compromise by offering the basement, which is more suitable for his work needs (quiet, no disruptions). \n\nIn this scenario, the husband is the one making a choice that affects the wife's daily life. The wife is responding logically to the situation. She's not the one who is in the wrong. The husband is the one who should consider his wife's needs by moving to the basement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main issue is the husband's refusal to compromise when the wife has offered an alternative that would make things easier for both.\n"
