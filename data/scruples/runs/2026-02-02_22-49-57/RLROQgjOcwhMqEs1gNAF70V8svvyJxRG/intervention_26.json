He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and handles chores and kids. The wife suggested the basement for his office, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she can't use the top floor without disturbing him, and she's feeling it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom might be based on personal preference for the view, but the wife is handling the majority of domestic responsibilities, which is a common issue in many households. The fact that his job is 90% conference calls means he needs a quiet environment, and the wife is trying to manage the kids and chores around that. However, by setting up in the bedroom, he's taking up a space that's traditionally a shared or private area for the family, not just for work. \n\nThe wife is taking on most of the housework and childcare, which is already a lot. If he's in the bedroom, she can't use the bathroom or take a nap without worrying about disturbing him. The basement is an available, quieter option. He's asking her to be quiet, but she's saying she can't promise that. It seems like he's not considering her needs and the practicality of the space. \n\nWork-life balance is important for both partners. The husband's work setup is affecting the wife's ability to work and manage her responsibilities. It's a shared living space, so each should accommodate the other. The wife is reasonable in her suggestion to use the basement, which is less disruptive. The husband's refusal might be seen as selfish, especially since it's impacting her significantly. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife is not the one causing the noise; the kids are. She's trying her best to keep them from interrupting his work, but if he's in the bedroom, it's a more sensitive area. However, the root problem is his choice of workspace. The basement would be a better location for both. The husband might be the one in the wrong here because he's prioritizing his comfort over the wife's ability to function without constant interruption. \n\nAlso, considering that both are working from home, the division of responsibilities and workspace should be mutually beneficial. The husband's setup is creating a conflict that could be easily resolved by moving to the basement. The wife is not at fault for not being able to control the kids' behavior entirely in the top floor if he's there. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
