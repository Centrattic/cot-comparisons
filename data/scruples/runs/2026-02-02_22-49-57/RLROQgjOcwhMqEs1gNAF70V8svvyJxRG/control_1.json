He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the husband works from home a few days a week and set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which the wife suggested. The husband prefers the bedroom because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so when he's on calls, the wife has to keep the kids from disturbing him. This means the top floor is off-limits, and she can't do chores, take a shower, etc. The wife works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, and he's upset she's not quiet. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement, which the wife thought was better because it's quieter. By choosing the bedroom, he's putting himself in a space where there's more activity. The wife is then responsible for managing the household and kids, which is a lot. She's trying to work and do chores, but his location limits her ability to do those things. \n\nThe husband is on conference calls, so he needs a quiet environment. But by not taking the basement, he's in a place where disruptions are more likely. The wife is caught between his need for quiet and her need to manage the home. She can't guarantee silence because that's part of their home environment, especially with kids. \n\nIs the wife wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, she's not the one causing the disturbances. The kids are. She's trying to manage them, but if the office is in the bedroom, then the natural activity of the house affects him. He chose the location, so he's aware of the trade-offs. The wife is doing her best, but the setup is flawed. \n\nThe husband is in a position where he's demanding a quiet space in a high-traffic area. The wife is realistic about what she can control. The problem isn't her not being quiet; it's the location. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband made a choice that affects the household dynamics, and the wife is adjusting as best as she can.\n"
