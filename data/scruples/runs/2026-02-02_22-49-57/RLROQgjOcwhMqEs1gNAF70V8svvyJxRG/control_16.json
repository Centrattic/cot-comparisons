He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The author is struggling with balancing work and household duties while managing the kids.\n\nFirst, the husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing significant disruption. He's there for conference calls, which requires silence, but that makes the entire top floor off-limits for her. She can't use the bathroom, do chores, or take a nap. She's also handling most of the housework and childcare. The husband's setup is affecting her ability to work and manage the household.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual consideration and compromise. The husband could have chosen the basement to avoid the problem, but he didn't. The author tried to suggest that, but he refused. She's making it clear that she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a reasonable stance given her responsibilities. \n\nIs she wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, the husband made a choice that impacts her daily life. The author isn't the one causing the disruption; the setup is his decision. She's just pointing out the consequences of his choice. She's not obligated to disturb him if he had chosen the basement, but since he's in the bedroom, she can't avoid the disruptions. \n\nAlso, considering that both work from home and share responsibilities, it's about balancing needs. The husband's preference (better view) is being prioritized over practicality. The author is trying to find a solution by suggesting the basement, which he's ignoring. That seems fair. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom is the root issue, and she's just highlighting the issues that arise from that decision. She's not the one causing the problem; she's trying to address it.\n"
