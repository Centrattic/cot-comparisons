He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. Now the wife is struggling with noise from the kids and can't use the bathroom or shower without disturbing him during conference calls. She works from home too and handles most chores and kids, so this setup is causing her a lot of stress.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he prefers the bedroom because of the view. But his job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife is doing her best to manage the kids but can't control them entirely, leading to disruptions. She suggested the basement, which is more suitable for his work needs but less convenient for her. The husband is upset that she's not keeping it quiet, but the wife argues that he should have chosen the basement to avoid the problem.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's choice of workspace affects the wife's daily life. The basement is available and would minimize disruptions for both. The husband's preference for the view over practicality might be seen as selfish, especially since the wife is handling the household and work. She can't guarantee silence in the bedroom because of the kids and her own responsibilities. The husband's refusal to move his office creates a conflict where the wife is forced to limit her activities.\n\nI think the key points are about shared responsibilities and consideration. The wife is trying to be considerate by agreeing to not disturb him when he's in the basement but can't do the same for the bedroom. The husband's choice is not respecting her needs. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband is in a position where he could choose a better location to minimize disruptions, and his decision to prioritize his view is causing unnecessary stress to his spouse. The wife isn't at fault for not being able to control the kids or her own needs when he's in the bedroom. The husband should be more flexible and compromise by moving to the basement to support her as well.\n"
