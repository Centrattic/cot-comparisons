He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which is causing a lot of disruption for the wife. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. The husband works mostly on conference calls, so during those times, the whole top floor is off-limits for her. She suggested he use the basement where there's more space and less noise, but he prefers the bedroom view. Now she's saying she can't even take a shower or nap when he's working there, and she can't promise silence if he stays there.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The key points are about shared space usage, responsibilities, and mutual respect. The husband chose to set up in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which would have been less disruptive. The wife is trying to manage her own work and household duties while dealing with the constraints of his setup. \n\nFrom what I read, the husband's choice is causing her significant inconvenience. The fact that he's not considering her needs as much as she's accommodating his by not being disruptive if he were in the basement. The wife is standing her ground by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which seems reasonable because she can't be expected to suppress her natural needs just because he's working. \n\nThe husband's argument is that she's being too noisy, but he's the one who chose a location that's in the middle of the active living areas. The wife's alternative (basement) is a better solution for minimizing disruption. So, by not moving to the basement, the husband is creating a problem that the wife can't control. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed, since he's in a space that's part of the family's regular use. The husband should have heeded her suggestion to reduce conflict. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
