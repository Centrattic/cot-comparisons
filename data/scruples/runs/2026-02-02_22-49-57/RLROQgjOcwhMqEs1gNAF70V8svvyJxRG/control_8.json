He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home. The husband set up his office in the bedroom, despite the basement being available. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and household to avoid disturbing him. She works from home too and handles most chores and childcare, which is being impacted by his setup. She suggested the basement for silence, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now she's telling him she can't guarantee silence there, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the wife) is wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect and practical living arrangements. The husband has a choice to work in a space that causes disruption, while the basement would be quieter. The wife is managing a lot already with her work and chores. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where her tasks are hindered. The wife is not at fault for setting boundaries, especially since she offered an alternative. The husband's decision to work in a disruptive location might be the issue. The answer likely leans towards B (author not in the wrong) because the husband chose a less ideal spot despite knowing the consequences. The wife's need to manage her responsibilities isn't unreasonable, and she's standing up for her needs.\n"
