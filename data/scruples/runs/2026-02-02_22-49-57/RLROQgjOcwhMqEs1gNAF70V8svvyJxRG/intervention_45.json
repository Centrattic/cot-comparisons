He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author who also works from home and manages household tasks and kids.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the author's suggestion. The basement was presented as a better option for fewer disturbances. The author's main issue is that the husband's setup in the bedroom restricts her ability to move freely, do chores, and take care of the kids without worrying about disturbing his work calls. \n\nThe husband is making conference calls, which are presumably important for his job, but the author is handling a lot of domestic responsibilities. The key point here is whether the husband should have listened to the author's suggestion. The author isn't stopping him from working; she's just not promising silence if he's in the bedroom. She's setting boundaries, which is reasonable because her needs are also valid. \n\nThe husband's choice to prioritize the view over the practicality of the basement might be seen as self-centered. The author is trying to balance work, chores, and childcare, which is a lot. By choosing the bedroom, the husband is creating a situation where the author has to constantly monitor the kids and limit her own activities to avoid disrupting his work. That seems unfair, especially since there's an alternative space available that would prevent these issues. \n\nThe author's stance is that she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is a fair point because she's managing other responsibilities. The husband is upset that she's not keeping it quiet, but if he had chosen the basement, the problem wouldn't exist. So the root of the conflict is the husband's decision not to use the more practical location. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she's advocating for her needs and pointing out the impracticality of the husband's choice. The husband, on the other hand, is not considering the author's workload and the practical implications of his office setup. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
