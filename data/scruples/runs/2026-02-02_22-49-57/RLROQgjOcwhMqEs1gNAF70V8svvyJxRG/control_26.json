He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his home office in their bedroom despite being offered the basement. The wife feels that this setup is causing her a lot of stress because she can't use the top floor for chores, showers, or naps when he's on calls. She's arguing that he should have chosen the basement to minimize disruption, and he's upset that she's not keeping it quiet in the bedroom. They're both working from home and dealing with kids, so space is a big issue.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement for a better view, but the basement would have been less disruptive. The wife can't do her tasks and is the one managing the kids and home. The husband is working on calls, which do require quiet, but he's in a space that's not ideal for that. The question is whether the wife is wrong for not keeping the room undisturbed when he's working.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she's taking on a lot of domestic responsibilities and now her ability to function is being hindered. She's offered a solution (basement) which he declined. The husband's choice to work in a high-traffic area (bedroom) might be the root issue. The fact that she's the one handling the kids and chores suggests she's in a position where she can't avoid making noise, unlike the basement which is more isolated. \n\nThe user might think that the wife should have insisted on the basement setup. However, the husband has his own reasons (view) for choosing the bedroom. But considering that the basement is an option with less disruption, maybe the husband is the one being unreasonable. The wife's right to use her own home shouldn't be compromised unless there's a mutual agreement. Since the husband didn't take the less disruptive option, the wife's frustration is valid. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the husband's choice to work in a space that causes more disruption isn't reasonable, especially when an alternative exists. The wife is not at fault for not being able to guarantee silence due to the nature of their home and responsibilities.\n"
