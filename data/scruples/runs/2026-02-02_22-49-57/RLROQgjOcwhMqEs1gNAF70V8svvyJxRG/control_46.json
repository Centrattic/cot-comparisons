He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's husband set up his home office in their bedroom, leading to conflicts where the author can't do daily tasks without disturbing him. The husband works mostly on conference calls, so the author has to manage the kids and household to avoid noise. The author suggests moving the office to the basement, which has more space, but the husband prefers the view and stays in the bedroom. The author can't shower, nap, or do chores when he's there, while she manages her job and the household.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. The husband chose the location of his office, which is in a shared space (the bedroom), which is a common area for both partners. The author is taking on the responsibility of ensuring his work environment is undisturbed, which affects her ability to do her own work and household duties. The husband is working from home, so he has some claim to a quiet workspace, but the bedroom is a personal space for both. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The husband's choice of office location affects the author's ability to use the space normally.\n2. The author is already managing a lot (work, kids, chores) and the setup is causing her inconvenience.\n3. The basement is an available, quieter option that would prevent these issues. The husband has been offered this solution but refuses for a preference (better view).\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when one person's work setup is causing significant disruption to another's life and work, especially when there's an alternative available, the person causing the disruption might be at fault. The husband is prioritizing his comfort (view) over practical considerations that would minimize conflict. The author isn't being unreasonable by not guaranteeing silence when the office is in a shared space. The husband's refusal to use the basement, despite it being a better solution, places the burden on the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one causing the problem by not choosing the basement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
