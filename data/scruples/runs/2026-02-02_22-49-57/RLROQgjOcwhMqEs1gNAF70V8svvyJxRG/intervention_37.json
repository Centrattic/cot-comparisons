He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong.\n\nThe husband set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The author has to manage the kids, chores, and her own work, but the husband's setup in the bedroom restricts her movement. She told him she can't guarantee silence there, so he's upset with her for not being quiet, while she's upset he didn't take the basement.\n\nFirst, the husband has a choice. He chose the bedroom over the basement for the view. The basement was suggested for its silence and less disruption. By choosing the bedroom, he's in a space that's naturally more active, especially with kids. The author is managing the household and her work, which is already a lot. The husband's decision impacts her ability to do basic tasks. \n\nThe key point is mutual respect and compromise. The husband could have chosen the basement to minimize disruption. The author can't control everything in the bedroom if there are kids. Her setting boundaries by saying she can't promise silence is reasonable. The husband's complaint about not being quiet seems misplaced since he had the option to work where it's quieter. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the husband made a choice that affects her, and she's asserting her needs. The answer should be B.\n"
