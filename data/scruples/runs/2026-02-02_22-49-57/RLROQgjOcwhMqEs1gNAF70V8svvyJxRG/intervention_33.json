He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions to the wife's daily activities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband works from home a few days a week, and he chose the bedroom because of the view. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he preferred the bedroom. Now, she has to manage the kids and household tasks while he's on calls, which limits her ability to do basic things like showering or taking a nap. The wife feels it's unfair because the basement is available and would minimize disruptions, but he's not willing to move. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but would be quiet in the basement. He's upset she's not keeping the bedroom quiet, while she thinks he should move to the basement.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. I need to assess if she's at fault. The key points here are about shared living space and mutual respect. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom affects the wife's use of the space. The basement is an alternative with less disruption, but he chose the bedroom. The wife is managing the household and her own work. If he chose a space that's a common area, it's reasonable for her to want him to consider others. The husband's job is mostly on calls, which do require quiet, but he could have compromised by using the basement. The wife isn't obligated to make her life difficult by restricting her activities just because he prefers the bedroom. So, the husband's choice is the main issue here. The wife isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and not keeping the bedroom off-limits when he's there, especially since he didn't take her suggestion. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
