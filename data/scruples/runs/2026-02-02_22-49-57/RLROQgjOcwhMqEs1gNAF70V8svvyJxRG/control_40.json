He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruption to the wife's daily activities because of his conference calls. The wife suggests moving to the basement for more silence but he refuses, preferring the view. She can't use the bathroom, do chores, etc., when he's in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for work despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. His job is mostly calls, so he needs silence. But the wife has her own work and household responsibilities. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to use that part of the house. The question is whether she's wrong for not keeping him undisturbed.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise in a shared living space. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom affects the wife's ability to manage her own tasks. The wife is setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. The husband is upset because she's not keeping quiet, but he initially refused the basement which would have avoided the issue. \n\nLegally or socially, there's no strict rule, but in terms of fairness, the husband made a choice that impacts his wife's daily life. The wife is just asserting her need for space and function. Since he could have chosen the basement to avoid conflict, but didn't, the responsibility might lie more with him. Therefore, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because the husband's decision to work in the bedroom created the problem.\n"
