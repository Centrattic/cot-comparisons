He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband set up his home office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife who handles most of the household duties and childcare.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The wife is now restricted from using the top floor, including the bathroom and doing chores. She's also working from home and taking care of the kids. The husband's job is mostly on conference calls, so he needs quiet, but the wife can't guarantee that in the bedroom. The wife told him she can't promise silence there, so he should move to the basement where there's space.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband might think he's just doing what he prefers (better view), but the consequences are limiting his wife's ability to manage the household. The wife is in a tough spot because she's handling both work and childcare, and the husband's setup is causing her stress. \n\nIs the wife in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, she's not the one causing the disturbance; the kids are. But she's responsible for managing them. However, the husband chose the location, knowing that the basement would avoid these issues. If he's insisting on the bedroom, then maybe he's the one causing the problem by not choosing the alternative solution offered.\n\nThe key point is that the husband was given a viable alternative (basement) but chose the bedroom for his preference. The wife can't control the kids' behavior, and she's already stretched thin. So, the husband's choice leads to the conflict, making the wife not the one at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
