He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruption to the wife's daily activities. The wife suggested moving the office to the basement for less disturbance, but he prefers the bedroom for better view. Now, she feels restricted in her own home because she can't use the bathroom, take a nap, etc., while he's on calls. She's the one handling most chores and kid duties, so his setup is impacting her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core of the issue. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion for the basement. His job is mostly conference calls, which require silence, so the wife has to manage the kids and avoid making noise. The wife is taking on more responsibilities because of this setup. The question is about who is at fault here.\n\nThe wife is trying to balance her work and household duties while the husband's choice is affecting her. The key points are: the husband's decision to work in the bedroom against the wife's advice, the resulting restrictions on her movements, and the imbalance in their shared responsibilities. \n\nFrom the description, the wife isn't being unreasonable by not guaranteeing silence if he's in the bedroom. It's a fair compromise to expect him to go to the basement where he won't be disturbed. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife's activities are limited. The husband's preference for the view seems less important than the practical issues of shared living spaces and responsibilities. \n\nThe wife is not in the wrong here because she's advocating for her own needs and the practical aspects of household management. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing the conflict, so the issue lies more with him not considering the impact on his wife. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
