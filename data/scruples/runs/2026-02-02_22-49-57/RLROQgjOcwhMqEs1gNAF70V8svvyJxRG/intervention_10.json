He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to a lot of disruption.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The husband works from home a few days a week and chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. His job is mostly conference calls, so she has to manage the kids to avoid disturbing him. This causes her to be unable to do chores, take a nap, or even use the bathroom in peace. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, but if he uses the basement, they'll leave him alone. He's upset that she's not quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nKey points: The husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing significant disruption to the wife's ability to do her job and manage household tasks. She offered an alternative (basement) that would avoid the problem. He chose not to take it, leading to her being unable to function properly. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband is making a choice that affects her negatively, and she's standing her ground. Setting up in the basement would solve the issue, but he's prioritizing his preference for the view over her needs. The wife is trying to balance her own work and domestic responsibilities, which are essential. The husband's refusal to move seems inconsiderate given the impact on her. \n\nSo, the author is just stating that she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is reasonable. The husband is the one not compromising. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
