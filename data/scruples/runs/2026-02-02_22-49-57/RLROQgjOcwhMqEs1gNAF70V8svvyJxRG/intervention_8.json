He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions. The wife suggested the basement but he chose the bedroom for the better view. Now she's struggling with managing the kids, chores, and her own work, all while he's in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband works from home part-time and his job involves a lot of conference calls. He's in the bedroom, which is a shared space, leading to the wife having to restrict their kids and herself from using that area. The wife is handling most of the household duties and her own work from home, which is being impacted. \n\nThe key points are: the husband's choice of workspace affects the wife's ability to manage the household and her own work. The wife offered an alternative (basement) that would minimize disruptions, but he refused. The husband is now upset because the wife can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is a valid point, but he chose a space that's not ideal for minimizing disturbances.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, when someone has the option to choose a workspace that's more secluded (like the basement) but opts for a shared space (bedroom) despite knowing it could cause issues, the onus is on them to adjust. The wife is being reasonable by suggesting the basement, which is more suitable for remote work, especially when it's 90% conference calls that require quiet. The husband's preference for the view seems less critical compared to the functional needs of the household.\n\nThe wife's frustration is justified because she's taking on more responsibilities and her work-life balance is affected. The husband's choice is causing her to have to restrict their children's movements and her own activities, which is a lot to ask. The fact that the basement is available and would prevent these issues means the husband's decision to stay in the bedroom is the root of the problem.\n\nSo, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong because she's making a reasonable suggestion to minimize disruptions. The husband is the one who's not compromising by choosing a less ideal workspace. The answer should be B (No), as the author isn't at fault.\n"
