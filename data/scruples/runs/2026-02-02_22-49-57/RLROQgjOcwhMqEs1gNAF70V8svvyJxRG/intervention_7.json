He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The wife suggested the basement, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, the wife can't do basic tasks or take care of the kids without disturbing him. She's working from home too and does most of the housework.\n\nSo, the author is saying she's not keeping him undisturbed, but he's the one who chose the bedroom. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in the bedroom, or if he's wrong for not moving to the basement. \n\nFrom what I read, the husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he needs quiet. But the wife is the one handling the kids and chores. She's saying that by being in the bedroom, he's making the entire top floor off-limits, which affects her ability to work and manage the household. The wife gave a clear suggestion (basement) which he ignored. Now she's setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband made a choice that affects her work and daily life. The wife is trying to balance both her job and household duties. If he chose a location that makes her job harder, isn't he the one at fault? She's standing her ground by not promising silence if he's in the bedroom. It seems like the husband's decision to prioritize his view over practicality is the root of the problem. The wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because he's the one who didn't take her advice. So the answer should be B, no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
