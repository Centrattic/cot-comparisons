He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband set up his home office in their bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement. Now the wife is struggling with managing the kids and household tasks because she can't disturb him during his conference calls, leading to her being unable to do basic things like showering or napping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband chose the bedroom for the better view and the wife's alternative was the basement. The husband's job requires being on calls, which is important, but so is the wife's ability to manage her work and household responsibilities. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The wife made a suggestion, but the husband didn't take it. Now, the wife is not promising silence if he's in the bedroom. Is it fair for her to set boundaries? Since she's already taking on most of the housework and childcare, having her movements restricted might be unreasonable. \n\nThe husband might think that once he's in the office, others shouldn't disturb him. But if the office is in a shared space (the bedroom), it's logical that the wife can't have full freedom. The basement offer would create a clear separation, making it easier for both. The husband's refusal to move there could be a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife is trying to balance work and home, and by not keeping the bedroom office undisturbed, she's asserting her needs. The husband's expectation of silence might be unrealistic if the office isn't in a dedicated, isolated area. \n\nSo, considering that the wife communicated her suggestion, and the husband didn't act on it, the wife's stance seems reasonable. The answer is B (No).\n"
