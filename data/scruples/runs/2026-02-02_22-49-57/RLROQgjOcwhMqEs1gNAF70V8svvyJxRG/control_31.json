He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home in their bedroom. Both parties work from home and share responsibilities with the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which the wife suggested because it would be less disruptive. He prefers the view. The issue is that when he's on calls in the bedroom, the whole top floor is off-limits, affecting the wife's ability to do chores, shower, nap, etc. The wife is managing the kids and household tasks while working, so her inability to take a shower or bathroom break is a real problem.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to disruptions for the wife, who is also working and managing household duties. While it's reasonable for the husband to want a quiet workspace, choosing a family area (the bedroom) where others live and need to use the space creates conflict. The wife is not wrong for pointing out that his location choice affects her ability to function. She gave a compromise option (basement) which he rejected. Now, she can't guarantee silence, which is fair because she can't control the kids or her own needs. The husband's expectation of silence in the bedroom, a shared space, might be unrealistic. So the author is not in the wrong; the husband's choice is the root issue here.\n"
