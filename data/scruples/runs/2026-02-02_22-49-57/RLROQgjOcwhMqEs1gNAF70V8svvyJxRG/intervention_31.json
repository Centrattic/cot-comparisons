He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions because of conference calls. The wife suggests moving the office to the basement for less disturbance, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now she can't do chores or take care of herself because the kids can't be around during his calls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. His job involves a lot of calls, which requires silence. However, the wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, and his setup is limiting her ability to function. The main conflict is about space usage and responsibilities.\n\nThe wife's argument is that she can't control the kids and the environment if he's in the bedroom. She's taking on most of the domestic work. The husband's preference for the bedroom's view seems like a personal choice, but it's affecting her daily life. \n\nIs the wife wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, she did agree to not disturb him if he worked in the basement. By choosing the bedroom, he's in a space they share, which is different from a dedicated basement office. The wife can't realistically control the kids all the time, and expecting her to manage the household without disruptions when he's in a shared space might be unfair.\n\nThe husband's stance is that he's working and needs silence, but setting up in the bedroom was his choice. The wife isn't the one causing the noise; the kids are. So, maybe the husband is in the wrong for not considering the practicality of the basement. The wife isn't at fault for not being able to control the children around the clock when he's in the bedroom.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The husband made a choice that affects the household, and the wife's responsibilities are impacted. The key issue is the husband's choice of workspace leading to the conflict, not the wife's inability to manage the environment.\n"
