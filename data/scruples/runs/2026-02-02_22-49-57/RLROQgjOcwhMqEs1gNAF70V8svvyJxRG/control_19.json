He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions to the wife's daily activities. The wife suggested the basement, but he chose the bedroom because the view is better. Now, the wife can't shower, do chores, or take naps when he's on calls. She works from home too and handles most of the household tasks and kids. The husband is upset that she's not keeping it quiet, while she's upset he's not using the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who's more in the wrong. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom seems self-centered. The basement was an available option that would minimize disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to manage her responsibilities. The wife's argument is about the practicality and fairness of their living situation. She's taking on a lot, and his decision affects her ability to function. The husband's job is primarily conference calls, which require quiet, but he could have chosen a location that doesn't interfere with her needs. The key point is that he had an alternative space available. So, the husband is not respecting her needs by not using the basement. The author (wife) is not in the wrong because she's advocating for her own needs and the practicality of their home setup. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
