He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is the asshole (AITA). The situation is about the husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author.\n\nFirst, the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so he needs silence. The author feels that by choosing the bedroom, he's making her responsible for keeping the kids and others quiet, which limits her own ability to use the top floor, including taking a shower, doing chores, or even using the bathroom. The author also works from home and handles most of the housework and childcare.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is the view is better in the bedroom. The author counters by saying he should have chosen the basement where there's guaranteed silence, and she can't promise silence in the bedroom. The husband thinks she's the problem for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the problem for not moving to the basement.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the husband made a choice that affects the author's daily life. He had the option to work in the basement, but he chose the bedroom for a non-essential reason (view). That seems like a selfish decision, as it's causing significant disruption to the author's ability to manage the household and her own work. The author is trying to set boundaries by telling him that if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee quiet, which is a reasonable response. She's not the one causing the disruptions; the husband's choice to work in a space that's part of the living area is the root of the problem. Therefore, the husband is more at fault here. The author isn't wrong for standing her ground and pointing out that his choice leads to issues. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
