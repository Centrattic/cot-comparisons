He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who has to manage the household and kids.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The basement would presumably be quieter and out of the way. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, so having the husband in the bedroom is making it hard for her to get things done. She can't take a shower, do chores, etc., because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him during calls.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is the better view, which seems trivial compared to the impact on the wife's daily life. The wife is clear that she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, but she offered the basement as an alternative. The husband is upset that she isn't quiet, but he's the one who chose the location that causes the problem.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband's choice to prioritize his view over the wife's ability to manage the home seems to be the root issue. The wife isn't at fault for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in a shared space that's causing her problems. The basement option was available and better for both parties. So the wife is justified in her stance. The answer should be B.\n"
