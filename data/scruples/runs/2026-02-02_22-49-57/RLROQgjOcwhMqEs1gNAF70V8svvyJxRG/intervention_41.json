He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to conflicts with the wife's ability to do chores and manage the kids.\n\nFirst, the husband chose his preferred location despite the basement being available. The wife offered the basement for less disruption, which makes sense because it's a better space for work from her perspective. The husband's job requires a lot of conference calls, so he needs silence, but the wife is handling the household and kids, which is already a big load. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual consideration. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom affects the wife's daily life significantly. The wife is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence there but can in the basement. The husband is upset that she isn't quiet, but he's the one who chose the space where they're all together. \n\nI think the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong because she's trying to manage her responsibilities and is upfront about the limitations of the bedroom setup. The husband could have chosen the basement to minimize conflict. The wife's stance is reasonable, and the husband's refusal to compromise might be the real issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
