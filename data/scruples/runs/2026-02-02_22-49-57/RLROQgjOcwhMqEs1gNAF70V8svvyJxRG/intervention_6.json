He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing the wife to have to manage the kids and household without being able to do her own tasks. The wife suggested moving to the basement for less disruption, but he wanted to stay in the bedroom for the view. The wife now feels restricted in her ability to work and manage chores because she can't disturb him during calls. She's asking if she's the asshole for not keeping him undisturbed while he works from home.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which would minimize disruptions. The wife is taking on most of the household responsibilities and her own work from home. By having the office in the bedroom, his work setup is affecting her ability to function. The key points here are mutual respect and shared responsibilities in a household.\n\nThe husband's choice to prioritize the view over the wife's practical concerns might be seen as inconsiderate. The wife is then left in a position where her needs are being compromised. While it's true that she should respect his work environment, the setup he chose is creating conflict. The wife isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and refusing to make her life harder because of his preference. It's reasonable for her to ask him to move to the basement to avoid such issues.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is wrong for not keeping the bedroom undisturbed. But the root issue is the husband's decision to locate his office there. The wife is not at fault for not accommodating an unreasonable setup. Her reasoning is practical, and she's trying to balance her own responsibilities. So, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
