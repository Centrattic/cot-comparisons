He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong here. The situation is about her husband working from home in their bedroom, which is causing disruptions for her. She suggested he move to the basement for more privacy and fewer interruptions, but he prefers the bedroom because of the view. Now, she can't use the bathroom or do chores without disturbing him, especially since he's on conference calls. The husband's job is 90% calls, so he needs quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband chose to set up in the bedroom despite the alternative space in the basement. The wife is handling most of the household and childcare, which is already a lot. By being in the bedroom, he's limiting her access to that area, affecting her ability to do her job and household tasks. The wife is firm that if he's in the basement, they won't disturb him, but if he's in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence. \n\nThe key points here are about shared space and mutual consideration. The husband's work requires quiet, but the wife's responsibilities are being hindered. The basement option seems to offer a compromise where both can work without interfering. The husband's choice to stay in the bedroom, despite knowing it would cause issues, might be where the problem lies. The wife is not at fault for not keeping him undisturbed if he's in a space that's not designated for quiet work. \n\nThe husband might argue he's entitled to work in a preferred location, but the wife's needs are also valid. Since the basement is available and would solve the problem, the husband's refusal to use it could make him responsible for the conflict. The wife isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially since she's already managing a lot. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
