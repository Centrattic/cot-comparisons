He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The author feels they can't use the bathroom or do chores without disturbing him, especially since he's on calls 90% of the time. They also work from home and handle most chores and kids.\n\nFirst, the husband's choice to work in the bedroom when given the option of the basement seems like a personal preference. But the problem is that this setup is causing significant disruption to the author's daily life. The husband's job requires silence, so the author can't use the top floor, including the bathroom. This seems like a big issue because basic needs are being affected. The author is trying to balance work, chores, and kids, which is already a lot. \n\nThe husband is not considering the impact of his decision on the author. Even though he's working from home, he's in a shared space (the bedroom) which is leading to conflicts. The author tried to offer a better solution (basement) where there would be no disruption, but he refused for a less critical reason (view). The fact that the author can't even take a shower or nap because of his work setup shows that his choice is causing unnecessary hardship. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both have jobs and responsibilities. The husband's refusal to take the basement, which would isolate him and reduce disturbances, is putting more burden on the author. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for flexibility. They're trying to accommodate his work needs but also need their own space. Since the basement is available and would solve the problem, the husband's choice is where the issue lies. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not keeping the husband undisturbed when he's in the bedroom, especially because he didn't take the alternative that would prevent such disturbances. The answer should be B.\n"
