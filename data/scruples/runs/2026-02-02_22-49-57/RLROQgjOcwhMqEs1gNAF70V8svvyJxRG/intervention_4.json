He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about setting up the home office in the bedroom versus the basement.\n\nThe husband chose the bedroom for his office because of the view, even though the basement is available and would be quieter. The wife is struggling with managing the kids and household tasks, and his setup is making it hard for her to do her own work, chores, or even take a shower. She suggested the basement, but he didn't go for it. Now she's being asked to keep the bedroom undisturbed, which affects her greatly.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct. The key points here are about mutual consideration and the use of available space. The husband's choice is creating a significant burden on the wife, who already has a lot on her plate. The fact that there's a viable alternative (basement) that would solve the problem suggests that the husband didn't prioritize her needs. The wife isn't obligated to make constant sacrifices for his preference. So, it seems like the husband is the one not being considerate here. The author (wife) isn't in the wrong for standing up for her own needs and not being able to guarantee silence if he insists on being in a space where disruptions are likely. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
