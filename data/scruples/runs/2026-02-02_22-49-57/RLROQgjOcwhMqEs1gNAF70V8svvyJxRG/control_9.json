He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement. The wife suggested the basement because it's quiet, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now, because of his job involving a lot of conference calls, the wife has to keep the kids from disturbing him, which restricts her own activities like showering, doing chores, etc. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him that if he's in the basement, they won't bother him, but she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom. He's upset she's not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The husband has the option to work from the basement, which is quieter, but he chose the bedroom for personal preference (the view). The wife is now having her daily tasks and her ability to work hampered because of this choice. The husband's work setup is affecting the household dynamics, and the wife is bearing the brunt of the disruptions. \n\nIn terms of fairness, when someone has a choice that directly impacts others, it's usually expected that they consider the impact on others. The husband's preference for the view is creating significant inconvenience for the wife. The wife is trying to set boundaries by asking him to move to the basement if he wants guaranteed quiet, which makes sense. The husband is upset with her for not keeping it quiet, but he's the one who chose the location. \n\nSo, the wife isn't in the wrong because she's advocating for her own needs and the practicalities of managing the household. The husband's decision to prioritize his comfort over the shared space's functionality is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
