He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, and the wife feeling restricted because of it. \n\nFirst, the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite the basement being available. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now, when he's on calls, the whole top floor is off-limits, affecting her ability to do chores, take a shower, or nap. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids.\n\nThe key points here are: The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to her having to manage everything else without being able to use the space freely. She's taking on most of the domestic responsibilities. The husband is not in the basement where he's supposed to be undisturbed, so he's choosing a location that causes her inconvenience. The wife is trying to set boundaries but is being forced to accommodate his preference at her own expense.\n\nI think the husband is the one in the wrong here. He has the option to work in the basement where it's less disruptive but chooses the bedroom, knowing it will affect her. The wife is not at fault for not being able to be quiet when he's in the bedroom, especially since she's managing the house and kids. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
