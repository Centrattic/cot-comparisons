He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe husband moved his office to the bedroom instead of the basement, even though the basement is quieter and would minimize disruptions. The wife suggests the basement, but he prefers the better view. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so when he's in the bedroom, the whole top floor is off-limits for the kids and her. That leaves her unable to do basic things like take a shower, do chores, or nap when the baby is asleep. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She tells him that if he's in the basement, they won't disturb him, but if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence. He's upset with her for not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not choosing the basement.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's choice of workspace affecting the wife's ability to function. The wife is trying to balance work and household responsibilities. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom leads to restrictions on her movements and activities. The wife is pushing back by saying she can't control the environment if he chooses that space, which makes sense because she can't control the kids or her own needs. The husband's preference for the view seems less critical than the practicality of minimizing disruptions. The wife is trying to find a solution that works for both, but he's not compromising. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about mutual respect and considering each other's needs. The husband's job requires quiet, but the wife's responsibilities also need space and flexibility. The basement option would solve both issues by isolating the work area, allowing the wife more freedom. By choosing the bedroom, the husband is creating a conflict that the wife is then responsible for managing, which isn't really her fault. The wife isn't in the wrong because she's setting boundaries and trying to protect her own ability to work and manage the household. The husband, by not compromising, is the one causing the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
