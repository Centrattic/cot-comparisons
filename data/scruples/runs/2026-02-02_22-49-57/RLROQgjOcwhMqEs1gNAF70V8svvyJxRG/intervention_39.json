He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. The wife is struggling because when he's on calls, she can't use the top floor, which affects her ability to do chores, take care of the kids, and even use the bathroom. She told him she can't promise silence if he stays in the bedroom, and now he's upset with her for not being quiet. She's arguing that he should have chosen the basement to avoid the issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband wanted the bedroom for the view, which is a personal preference. But he's causing disruption to the wife's daily life. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is a lot. The basement is available and would minimize disruption. The husband's choice to prioritize his view over her practical needs seems problematic. The wife is reasonable in saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a valid concern. She's not the one creating the problem; he is by choosing a location that interferes with her responsibilities. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
