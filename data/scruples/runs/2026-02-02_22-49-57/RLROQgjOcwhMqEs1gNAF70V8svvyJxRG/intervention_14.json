He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, leading to disruptions for the author and their children. The husband works from home a few days a week, and his job is mostly conference calls. The author suggests moving the office to the basement for less disruption, but he prefers the bedroom because of the view. The author then can't do chores, shower, or take naps because they have to keep the kids from disturbing him. The author works from home too and does most of the chores and childcare. They argue about this, and the author thinks the husband is in the wrong for not moving to the basement.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not, and wants to know if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's choice to set up in the bedroom despite the basement being available. The author's need to manage the household and work. The husband's job requires silence, but the author's ability to function is being hindered. The husband is not flexible, and the author is trying to balance work and home duties. \n\nThe husband's job is important, but so is the author's ability to work and manage the household. The basement is available and would solve the problem, but he refuses. The author is being reasonable by offering to ensure no disturbances in the basement but can't in the bedroom. The husband's preference for the view isn't justifying the disruption. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is not accommodating the author's needs by moving to the basement, which is a reasonable compromise. The author is not wrong for not keeping the husband undisturbed when he's in a space that's not designated for his use. The bedroom is a shared space, and the author has a right to use it as well. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to balance work and family responsibilities, and the husband is not being reasonable by refusing to move to a more suitable location.\n"
