He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife who can't use the space freely.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption. Now, since he's in the bedroom, she's stuck managing the kids and can't use the top floor, including the bathroom. She works from home too and does most chores. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset she's not quiet enough.\n\nSo, is the author (the wife) in the wrong? Well, the husband made a choice to work where it's easier for him, but that's causing her significant inconvenience. The wife didn't force him to stay in the bedroom. She offered an alternative (basement) that would have avoided the problem. By suggesting he move, she's trying to balance their needs. The husband is now blaming her for not keeping the environment quiet, but that's not her responsibility if he chose a space that's difficult to isolate. She's already taking on more household duties, so expecting her to manage all the disruptions without moving his office seems unfair. The answer is B; she's not in the wrong.\n"
