He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves their husband setting up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, causing disruptions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband works from home part of the week and prefers the bedroom for the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so he wants to avoid disturbances. The wife suggests the basement for less disruption, but he refuses. Now, the wife is struggling with household chores and childcare because she has to keep the top floor quiet when he's working. She feels his choice is making her life harder, while he's upset that she can't be quiet in the bedroom.\n\nThe question is whether the author (wife) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the details: The husband's job requires being undisturbed, but he chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The basement is available and would minimize disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife can't use the main living areas when he's working. The wife is taking on most of the housework and childcare, so her ability to function is being hindered. \n\nThe key point is that the husband made a choice that affects the wife's daily life. The wife tried to accommodate by offering the basement, but he didn't take it. If he's in the basement, disruptions would be less. So maybe the issue is his choice, not the wife's. The wife is trying to balance work and household duties, and his setup is making that impossible. \n\nOn the flip side, the husband might argue that the wife should manage the noise, but she's also working from home and handling the kids. It's a shared responsibility, but the husband's decision to place his office where it causes conflict seems problematic. The wife isn't at fault for not keeping him undisturbed if he's in a space that's not ideal for his job's needs. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's choice to work from the bedroom leads to the conflict, and the wife's attempts to manage are reasonable.\n"
