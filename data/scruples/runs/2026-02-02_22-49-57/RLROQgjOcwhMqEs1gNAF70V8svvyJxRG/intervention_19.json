He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home in their bedroom.\n\nFirst, the husband moved his office to the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so he needs silence. However, by choosing the bedroom, he's making it hard for the wife to do her own work, take care of the kids, or even do basic chores like showering because she has to avoid disturbing him. The wife argues that if he wanted silence, he should have chosen the basement where it's guaranteed. The husband is upset with her for not being quiet, but she's upset he's not considerate of her needs.\n\nI need to determine if the wife is in the wrong. The key points are: the husband chose the bedroom despite the alternative, the wife is managing work, kids, and chores, and the husband's choice is causing her significant inconvenience. The question is whether she's obligated to maintain silence despite his choice. Since the husband had the option to work in the basement where there's less disruption, the wife isn't necessarily at fault for not keeping him undisturbed in a location he chose against her advice. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
