He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband setting up his office in their bedroom, which is causing disruption to her and the kids. The husband prefers the better view, but this setup limits her ability to do basic tasks and manage the household.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is more practical. The author was clear about the basement being a better option because it would minimize disturbances. However, he refused, prioritizing the view over practicality. \n\nNow, the author is working from home too and handling most chores and childcare. Her argument is that the husband's choice to work in the bedroom is making the entire top floor inaccessible for her and the kids during his calls. She even compromised by saying she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, which seems reasonable. The husband, on the other hand, blames her for not being quiet, which feels unfair because the root issue is his decision to work in a space that's causing the disruption in the first place.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband is the one who made a choice that affects the household's dynamics. The author is trying to balance work, chores, and childcare, which is already a lot. The basement option would have minimized these issues. The husband's refusal to move his office to a less disruptive area seems to be the main problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because the setup he chose is inherently problematic. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
