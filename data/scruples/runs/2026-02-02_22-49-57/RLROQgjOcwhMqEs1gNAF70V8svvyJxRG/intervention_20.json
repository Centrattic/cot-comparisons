He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a person whose husband set up his office in their bedroom instead of the basement. The person (probably the wife, based on the context) is arguing that she's not in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because he chose the bedroom. The husband is working from home part-time, mostly on conference calls, and the wife feels that by choosing the bedroom, he's making it impossible for her to do her own work, chores, and take care of the kids and baby without disturbing him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement, which the wife suggested. The basement is quieter and presumably more isolated, but he wanted the better view. Now, because he's in the bedroom, the whole top floor is off-limits during his calls, which affects the wife's ability to do her tasks and take care of the kids. The husband is upset that she's not keeping him undisturbed, but the wife is saying he's the one who made a choice that limits her space.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, if he chose a location that's part of their shared living space, then it's reasonable for her to expect that he should consider her needs too. By moving to the basement, he could have a dedicated workspace without interrupting her. Since he didn't do that, and instead took up their bedroom (which they both use) as his office, it's putting a burden on her to manage around his work setup. The wife is trying to balance her work, chores, and childcare, which is a lot already. By not choosing the basement, he's forcing her to accommodate his preference, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. She's justified in standing her ground because the husband made a choice that affects her daily life. The answer should be B.\n"
