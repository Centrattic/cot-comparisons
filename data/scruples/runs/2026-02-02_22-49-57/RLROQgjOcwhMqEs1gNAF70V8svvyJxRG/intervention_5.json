He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not keeping their husband undisturbed while he works from home. The husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the basement is available. The author is handling all the chores and kids, and having to keep them quiet when he's on calls. She suggested the basement for better silence but he prefers the bedroom for the view.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is the location of the office. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, which require a quiet environment. The author can't use the top floor freely because of that. She's also working from home and managing the house and kids. The husband says she's the asshole for not being quiet, but she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Well, she did tell him that if he's in the basement, they won't disturb him, but if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence. That seems fair. She's trying to balance her own work and responsibilities. The husband chose the bedroom despite the alternative. Maybe he's the one making the situation harder by not taking the basement option. The author isn't obligated to disrupt her own work and chores just because he chose an inconvenient location. So probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
