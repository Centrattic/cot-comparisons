He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband moved his office to the bedroom instead of the basement, which has fewer disturbances. The wife is now having trouble with the kids not disturbing him, which affects her ability to do chores, shower, nap, etc. She asked him to go to the basement for more space, but he preferred the view. Now she's saying he's being unreasonable by not going to the basement, and he's upset that she's not keeping quiet when he's working in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has the right to work in a comfortable environment, but maybe he's not considering the impact on his wife. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is a lot. If the basement is available and offers a disturbance-free zone, it seems logical for him to use that. But he chose the bedroom for the better view. The wife is honest about the consequences of that choice\u2014she can't move around freely when he's on calls. \n\nIs the wife being unreasonable by not guaranteeing silence in the bedroom? Well, she's already doing the most she can by keeping the kids from disturbing him. But the problem is that her own tasks are being hindered. If the basement is an option, then maybe the husband should prioritize that for the family's overall convenience. The wife isn't wrong to point out that his choice affects her negatively. He's choosing his comfort over her ability to manage the household. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's working from home means he should be considerate of the home environment. Since the basement is available and silent, it's a fair request for him to use that space. The wife isn't refusing to be quiet; she's saying she can't promise that in the bedroom. So she's being honest about the limitations. The husband is being difficult by not accepting that. Therefore, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
