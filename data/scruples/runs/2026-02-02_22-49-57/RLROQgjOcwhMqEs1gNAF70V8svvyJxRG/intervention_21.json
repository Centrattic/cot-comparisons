He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing the wife to have to manage the kids and household without any privacy or ability to do her own work or chores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife, who also works from home and handles most chores and kids, can't do anything without disturbing him. She suggested the basement for him, but he refused. Now she's saying he's the asshole for not moving, and he's calling her the asshole for not being quiet.\n\nThe wife argues that she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, so she told him if he stays there, they won't bother him. But the problem is that his choice to be in the bedroom is making her life harder. The husband is being asked to move to the basement, which has space, but he doesn't want to. \n\nI think the key points are: the husband's choice affects the wife's ability to function. The basement option exists and is better for both, but he refuses. The wife is trying to manage their home while working, which adds stress. It's about compromise and considering each other's needs. The husband is prioritizing his comfort (view) over the wife's practical needs. \n\nSo, is the author (the wife) in the wrong? If she's trying to maintain normal household functions and her job, but he's in a shared space, maybe she's not in the wrong. The husband is the one choosing to be in the bedroom, which is a shared area, and expecting silence. The wife is being realistic about the limitations. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
