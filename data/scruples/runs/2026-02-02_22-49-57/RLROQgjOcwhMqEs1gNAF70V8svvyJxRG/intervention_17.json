He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author's husband set up his office in their bedroom despite being offered the basement. The husband works mostly on conference calls, so the author has to manage the kids and household tasks to avoid disturbing him. She can't even take a shower or nap peaceably. The husband is upset that she's not keeping quiet, but she argues that he should have chosen the basement. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose to work in the bedroom for the view, which seems like a personal preference. However, this choice affects the author's ability to manage household responsibilities. She works from home too and handles most chores and kids. The husband's setup is causing her stress and limitations. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and practicality. While the husband has the right to choose his workspace, it's impacting the author's daily life. The author made a reasonable suggestion (basement) for his office, which he declined. She's not obligated to make his work environment perfect at the expense of her own needs. The husband's complaints about not being quiet seem unfair because he could have chosen a space that doesn't interfere with her. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but would for the basement. That shows she's trying to be fair. The husband's job is part of their shared home, so they should find a balance. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own needs and responsibilities. So, the answer is B.\n"
