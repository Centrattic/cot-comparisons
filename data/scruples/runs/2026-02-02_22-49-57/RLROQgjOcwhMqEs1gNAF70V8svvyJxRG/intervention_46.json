He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which is causing the wife a lot of disruption. The wife suggested the basement, which has more space and would be quieter, but the husband prefers the bedroom for the view. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, and the husband's setup is making her life harder. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, but promised no disturbances in the basement. He's upset with her for not being quiet, but she thinks he's in the wrong for not moving to the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the expectations and responsibilities. The husband is working from home, which should ideally be set up in a place that minimizes disruption to the household. The wife is doing the majority of the domestic work and childcare, which is already a lot. By choosing the bedroom, he's making it harder for her to do her own work and manage the home. The basement is available and would be better for both parties\u2014quieter for him and less disruptive for her.\n\nThe wife's argument is that she can't promise silence in the bedroom because of the kids, but she can in the basement. The husband is choosing a location that makes his work interfere with her responsibilities. The key here is shared responsibility and mutual consideration. While the husband has a right to a quiet workspace, the wife's ability to function and manage the household is also important. The fact that the basement is an option suggests that the husband could have chosen a more considerate location. The wife's refusal to compromise on silence in the bedroom, while reasonable, is a logical consequence of his decision. The husband is not respecting her needs by staying in the bedroom, so the wife is not in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
