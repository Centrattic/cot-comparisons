He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The setup is that the husband works from home and chose to set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which is quieter. The author is the wife who has to manage the kids, chores, and her own work, but the husband's choice limits her ability to use the top floor, including showering and doing chores. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, so he's upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. Let's look at the key points. The husband has the option to work from the basement, which is quieter, but he chose the bedroom for the view. The wife is already juggling her job, chores, and kids. By choosing the bedroom, he's essentially making her responsible for creating a quiet environment there, which is difficult with kids and the other responsibilities. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the husband wanted a quiet workspace, he should have set it up in the basement where silence is guaranteed. The wife isn't at fault for not being able to enforce silence in an area she's already managing multiple tasks. The husband's decision to place his office in a high-traffic area (bedroom, which implies proximity to kids' rooms) complicates things. The wife's refusal to make promises about silence is reasonable because she can't control the kids' behavior or her own needs. \n\nThe husband's job is mostly conference calls, which require quiet, but his choice of location creates a conflict. The wife isn't the one causing the noise; the kids are. So, the responsibility lies with the husband to choose a suitable workspace. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the husband made an impractical choice, and she's being realistic about her limitations.\n"
