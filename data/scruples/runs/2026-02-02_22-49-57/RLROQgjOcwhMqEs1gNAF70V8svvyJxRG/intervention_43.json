He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The wife suggested the basement, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now she can't do things like shower or take a nap because he's on calls. She works from home too and does most of the chores and takes care of the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The husband's choice affects her ability to work and manage the household. The wife is trying to balance work and home responsibilities. She gave a reasonable alternative (basement) which he rejected. He's now expecting her to keep everything quiet in the bedroom, which is part of their shared living space.\n\nThe question is whether the author (wife) is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The user thinks she's not wrong, but wants confirmation. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, when someone's work setup disrupts another's ability to function, especially when alternatives are available, the person causing the disruption might be at fault. The husband had the option to work in a separate area (basement) that wouldn't interfere. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife can't use that space freely. The wife isn't obligated to make sacrifices if the other party isn't considering her needs. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband is the one who chose the location, knowing the consequences. The wife is justified in not guaranteeing silence if he's in a space that's part of their shared home, especially when he has another option. The husband's refusal to use the basement is the root issue here.\n"
