He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband working from home and setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The wife suggested the basement for less disturbance, but he preferred the bedroom for the view. Now, the wife can't do basic tasks without disturbing him, and the husband is upset she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. However, the wife is handling most of the household duties and work, and his choice is limiting her ability to function. The wife tried to compromise by saying if he works in the basement, they won't disturb him. But he chose not to take that option.\n\nLegally or morally, is the wife at fault? The husband made a choice that affects her daily life. The wife isn't obligated to keep the bedroom undisturbed if he's there; that's his choice. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom leads to these conflicts. The wife is trying to balance work and family, and the husband's preference is creating friction. So, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one making the choice that causes the disruption. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
