He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, which is causing a lot of disruption for the wife. She handles most of the housework and childcare, and he's using the bedroom, which is their shared space, leading to her being unable to do basic tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption, which makes sense because the basement is probably a separate area. By choosing the bedroom, he's taking over a space that's shared, not just his individual workspace. The wife now has to manage the kids and housework without being able to use the top floor, which is where the bedroom is. That's a lot of stress on her.\n\nThe husband is working from home, so he needs quiet for calls. But the wife's needs are also valid\u2014she works from home too and has childcare responsibilities. The key point here is that the bedroom is a shared space. By setting up his office there, he's limiting her ability to use that space. The husband's choice to prioritize his view over the practicality of shared space use seems to be the root of the problem. The wife is trying to maintain a balance, but the husband's setup is causing her to have to constantly adjust, which is unfair.\n\nThe wife isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries. She can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a shared area. The husband's refusal to move to the basement, which was suggested for minimal disruption, shows he's not considering her side. The answer likely leans towards the husband being in the wrong, making the author (the wife) not the asshole. So the answer should be B.\n"
