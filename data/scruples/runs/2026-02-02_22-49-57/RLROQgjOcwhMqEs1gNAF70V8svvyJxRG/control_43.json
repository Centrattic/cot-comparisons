He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband works from home and set up his office in their bedroom despite being offered the basement. The author feels that by choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to do daily tasks and take care of the kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband chose the bedroom because of the view, even though the basement is available and would be quieter. The author is responsible for managing the kids and household chores, which is challenging when the office is in the bedroom. The husband's job involves a lot of conference calls, so he needs quiet. However, the author can't use the bathroom, shower, or nap when he's on calls. She's also working from home and handling most of the housework and childcare.\n\nThe main issue is the location of the office. The husband's choice affects the author's ability to function. The question is whether she's wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The husband's decision to place his office in the bedroom leads to this problem. The author isn't making noise; she's just trying to use the house normally. The husband's setup restricts her use of the space. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's not the one causing the noise. The problem stems from the husband's choice of location. The author is trying to balance work, childcare, and household duties, which is already a lot. By choosing the bedroom, the husband is creating a situation where she can't perform these tasks without disturbing him. She's not the one at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
