He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in their bedroom, causing disruptions, and the author can't do basic tasks because of it. \n\nFirst, the husband moved his office to the bedroom despite the basement being available. The author suggested the basement for fewer disturbances, but he preferred the view. Now, the husband's job is mostly conference calls, so the author has to keep everyone else from disturbing him, which restricts her own activities.\n\nThe author is working from home too and handles most house chores and kids. By choosing to work in the bedroom, the husband is limiting her ability to do things like shower, take a nap, or even use the bathroom in peace. The author told him that if he's in the basement, they won't bother him, but if he stays in the bedroom, they can't guarantee silence. The husband thinks she's the problem for not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nSo, the key points here: the husband made a choice that affects the author's daily life. The author is taking on the majority of household responsibilities and her job while trying to accommodate his work setup. The husband's preference for the bedroom over the basement is causing conflict. The author is setting boundaries by saying she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a reasonable response. The husband's job requires a quiet environment, but he could have chosen a location that minimizes disruption for everyone. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband has the option to move his office to the basement where it's less disruptive. The author isn't obligated to create a disturbance-free zone for him if he's in a shared space like the bedroom. The husband's choice to prioritize his personal preference (view) over practicality (basement's quietness) seems to be the root of the issue. The author is not in the wrong for holding him accountable for his choice and its consequences. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
