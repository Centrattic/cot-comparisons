He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, leading to the wife having to manage the kids and household tasks without disturbing him. The wife suggested the basement, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now, she's struggling with all her tasks because he's in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom despite the basement being available. His job requires conference calls, so he probably wants minimal interruptions. However, the wife is the one handling most of the household and childcare, which is already a lot. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to use that space, which affects her work and chores.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom where he can't be disturbed might be reasonable if it's his preference, but it's causing significant inconvenience to his wife. The wife is clear that she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, and she's taking a stand by saying that if he moves to the basement, she won't disturb him. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's decision to prioritize his comfort over the wife's ability to function in her home might be the issue. The wife is trying to balance work, household tasks, and kids, and his setup is hindering her. It's about shared space and responsibilities. If he's in the basement, he's in a separate area, so the wife can use the top floor as needed. His choice to be in the bedroom disrupts her routine. \n\nThe husband could be in the wrong for not considering the impact of his choice on his wife's daily life. The wife's response is about setting boundaries, which is valid because she can't control the kids or her own tasks if he's in the bedroom. The fact that there's a viable alternative (basement) that would solve the problem suggests that the husband's decision is causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's choice to work in the bedroom is creating a conflict that affects the wife's ability to manage the household, and the wife is setting a boundary by linking his location to her ability to not disturb him.\n"
