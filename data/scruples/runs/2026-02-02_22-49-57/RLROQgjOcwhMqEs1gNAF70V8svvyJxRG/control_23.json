He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband started working from home a few days a week. He set up his office in their bedroom instead of the basement, which was suggested by the wife. The wife's reasoning for suggesting the basement is that it would be quieter, so the kids wouldn't disturb him. But he prefers the bedroom because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so during those times, the whole top floor is off-limits to the children, which affects the wife's ability to do chores, take showers, nap, etc. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but if he moved to the basement, they wouldn't bother him. Now they're arguing, and she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about shared space and responsibilities. The husband chose to work in a space that's part of the family area (bedroom) instead of a more isolated area (basement). By doing so, he's limiting the wife's ability to use that space for her own needs, especially since she has her own work and childcare duties. The wife is trying to balance her responsibilities and her own needs, which are being hindered by his choice. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband made a choice that impacts the household dynamics. The wife is trying to hold him accountable for that choice. The husband is expecting her to accommodate his work setup, but he didn't consider the trade-offs of where he sets up. The wife's argument is that if he wants a quiet space, he should go where others won't interfere, rather than making her manage all the disruptions. \n\nThere's also the aspect of shared responsibilities. Since she handles most of the housework and childcare, her ability to do her job and manage the home is being compromised. It's a common issue in households where both partners work from home and need dedicated spaces. The husband's refusal to move to the basement, despite the wife's suggestion, might be seen as not considering her workload and the practicalities of their living situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The husband's decision to set up in the bedroom creates a conflict because it's a shared space. The wife isn't at fault for not keeping the bedroom silent when it's being used as a family space. The husband's choice to prioritize his preference (view) over practicality and her needs might be the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
