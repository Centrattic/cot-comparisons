He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in their bedroom, which causes the wife to have to manage the kids and household tasks without being able to use the room or bathroom. The wife suggested he move to the basement for a quieter environment, but he prefers the bedroom's view. The author (wife) is upset because he's not taking her suggestion, leading to her being restricted in her own home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The husband chose the bedroom for his office despite the wife's alternative suggestion. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife ends up managing both her work and the kids, and his setup is making it hard for her to do basic tasks. \n\nThe question is whether the wife is wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The key here is about mutual respect and compromise. The husband's job requires silence, but the wife's needs (showering, chores, etc.) are also valid. By choosing the bedroom, he's essentially taking over the shared space, which affects her daily life. The wife did offer a solution (basement) that would have solved the problem, but he didn't take it. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? If the husband insisted on the bedroom without considering the impact on his wife, then he might be at fault. The wife isn't wrong for standing up for her needs and pointing out the consequences of his choice. The husband's decision to not move to the basement, despite knowing it's causing issues for the wife, could be seen as selfish. The wife's response is about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband made a choice that affects her, and she's justified in expressing that.\n"
