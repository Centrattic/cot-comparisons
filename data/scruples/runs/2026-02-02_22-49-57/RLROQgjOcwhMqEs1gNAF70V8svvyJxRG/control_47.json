He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The husband works from home a few days a week and set up his office in their bedroom instead of the basement, which the wife suggested. The problem is that when he's on conference calls, the wife can't do normal things like shower, do chores, take a nap, etc. They argue about whether the wife is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed, but she feels the husband is wrong for not using the basement.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The basement is quieter and more spacious, so why did he pick the bedroom? Maybe because the view is better, but that's a personal preference. However, the wife is taking on most of the household chores and childcare, which is already a lot. By setting up in the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to move around freely. \n\nThe wife said she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is a reasonable statement since kids are unpredictable. The husband might be expecting her to control the environment to ensure his work isn't disturbed, but that's a lot to ask. It's not realistic to expect complete silence when there are kids around. \n\nThe wife is working from home as well and handling most of the chores and kids. So when the husband is in the bedroom, her ability to manage the house and take care of the baby is restricted. The basement option would allow both of them to work without interfering with each other. The husband's choice to prioritize his view over the wife's ability to function at home seems like the main issue here. \n\nSo the wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because it's impossible to control the kids and household completely. The husband should have considered the practicality of the basement setup. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
