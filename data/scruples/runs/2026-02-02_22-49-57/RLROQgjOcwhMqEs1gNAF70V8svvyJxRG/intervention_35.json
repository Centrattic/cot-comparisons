He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about where the husband set up his office.\n\nSo, the husband works from home a few days a week and chose the bedroom as his office. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so when he's on calls, the whole top floor is off-limits. The wife can't do chores, take a shower, or nap. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him that if he's in the basement, they won't disturb him, but she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom. He's calling her the asshole, but she thinks he is.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom might seem reasonable for him, but it's causing significant disruption to the wife's daily life and responsibilities. The wife is taking on a lot\u2014work, kids, chores\u2014and the husband's setup is limiting her ability to function. The basement was an option that would have allowed him to work with less interference from the family and also let the wife manage her tasks without being restricted.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong for not keeping the husband undisturbed? Well, she's trying to balance her own needs and responsibilities. If he had chosen the basement, which was suggested and would minimize disruptions, maybe the problem wouldn't exist. The husband's preference for the view is causing a conflict that affects their household dynamics. The wife is being realistic about her limitations\u2014she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom because of the kids and other tasks.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's choice is self-serving and not considering his wife's workload. The wife is being practical and suggesting a solution (basement) that would benefit both. By staying in the bedroom, he's making her life harder. So, the wife isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one not considering her needs and the practicality of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
