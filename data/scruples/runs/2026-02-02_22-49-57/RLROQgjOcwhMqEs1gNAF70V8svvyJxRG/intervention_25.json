He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who has to manage the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view, even though the basement is quieter. The wife is handling the kids, household chores, and also works from home. She can't use the bathroom, take showers, or nap when he's on calls because the top floor is off-limits. She suggested the basement for his office but he refused. Now she's saying she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, and he's upset that she's not quiet enough. \n\nThe author is the wife here. She's trying to balance her work, chores, and kids, which is a lot. The husband's choice of workspace is causing conflicts. The question is whether she's wrong for not allowing him to work undisturbed in the bedroom. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The husband had a choice to set up in the basement, which is quieter, but he chose the bedroom. 2) The wife is managing a lot and his setup is causing her significant inconvenience. 3) He's upset that she can't be quiet, but he could have chosen a better location. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if he had chosen the basement, he wouldn't have these issues. The wife can't control the kids 100%, so expecting her to keep the bedroom silent is unrealistic. She's making a practical choice for herself, suggesting he move to a space where he's less likely to be disturbed. \n\nThe husband might feel entitled to work without interruptions, but he ignored the reasonable alternative. The wife is not in the wrong because she's making a compromise (allowing him to stay in the bedroom) but setting a boundary that she can't guarantee silence. It's about mutual respect and considering each other's needs. The husband's choice to prioritize the view over quiet space leads to the conflict, so the wife isn't the one at fault here.\n"
