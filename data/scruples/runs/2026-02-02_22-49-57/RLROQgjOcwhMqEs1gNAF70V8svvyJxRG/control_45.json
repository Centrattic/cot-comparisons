He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which is causing a lot of disruption for the wife. She suggested the basement, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she's the one handling the kids, chores, and her own work, but when he's in the bedroom working, especially on calls, she can't do anything because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She even can't use the bathroom or take a nap when the baby is asleep. The husband is upset that she's not keeping it quiet, but she's upset he didn't take the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's choice to work from the bedroom might be inconvenient for the wife. She's handling a lot of responsibilities and the setup is making her life harder. On the other hand, he might have a valid reason for preferring the bedroom's view. But the key here is that the wife offered an alternative\u2014basement\u2014which would avoid the disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a conflict that affects her daily tasks and well-being. \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The wife's argument is that she's not responsible for keeping him undisturbed if he chose the bedroom. The husband argues that she should be quiet. But since the basement was an option, and he chose not to use it, leading to her being restricted, it seems unfair to blame her. She's trying to manage everything else, and his choice causes her stress. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The husband is the one who didn't choose the less disruptive option. The wife's stance is reasonable because she can't control the kids or her own needs if the office is in a shared space.\n"
