He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about their husband setting up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, causing disruptions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom because he likes the view, even though the basement is available. He works with a lot of conference calls, so he wants quiet. The author of the post is the one who has to manage the kids and household tasks, and she can't use the bathroom or do chores when he's working from the bedroom. She suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he refused. She then said she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and household responsibilities. The husband is prioritizing his comfort (view) over practicality (quieter space for both of them). The author is working from home too and handling most chores and kids. If he's in the basement, the author can have more space and quiet to work and take care of things. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to function effectively. She's not the one causing the noise; he's the one in a space that's hard to keep quiet when there are kids and chores. The basement would solve that problem. So, the husband's choice is causing the issue. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and not being able to control the environment in the bedroom when there are children. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
