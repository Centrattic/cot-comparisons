All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a person (the author) who is considering sending a screenshot of their friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemotherapy and has serious health issues. The friend made a joke about the girlfriend's weight and appearance, which is a sensitive topic given her medical condition. \n\nFirst, the friend's comment is clearly hurtful and inappropriate. Making fun of someone's health-related appearance, especially when they're battling a severe illness, is not okay. The author's girlfriend has been through a lot, and the friend's remarks are insensitive.\n\nNow, the author is considering sharing this screenshot with the friend's mom. The question is whether this action puts the author in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a friend who has crossed a line and showed no remorse. The friend's comment was cruel, and the author might feel justified in exposing this behavior to the friend's parent to hold them accountable. On the other hand, sending a screenshot could be seen as a form of retaliation or revenge, which might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation or expose private messages without consent.\n\nHowever, considering the context\u2014especially the friend's lack of remorse and the severe nature of the comment about someone with a serious illness\u2014the author's actions might be a way to protect their girlfriend and potentially make the friend understand the severity of their words. The author isn't just looking for revenge; they're trying to correct a friend who is being hurtful without understanding the impact.\n\nIn such cases, people often feel they have to take matters into their own hands when the person isn't listening. The key here is the intent. The author's intent is to address the friend's harmful behavior, not just to retaliate. Since the friend is unrepentant, the author might feel this is the only way to make them understand the consequences of their actions. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because they are responding to a hurtful situation in a way that seeks accountability, even if the method is questionable.\n"
