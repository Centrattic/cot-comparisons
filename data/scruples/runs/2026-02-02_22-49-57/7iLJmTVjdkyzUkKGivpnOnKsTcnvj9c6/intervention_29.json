All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a really hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author responded, and then the friend doubled down with a comment about the girlfriend's weight, which is directly related to her medical condition. The author then tells the friend he went too far, but the friend doesn't apologize. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. Let's break it down. The friend made a harmful joke about a sensitive health issue. The author tried to address it directly but didn't get an apology. The friend's behavior was inconsiderate and possibly cruel. The author is considering escalating by involving the friend's mom. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified in wanting to hold their friend accountable, especially since the friend showed no remorse. The comment was targeted at a vulnerable situation (someone's health), which is a serious issue. The author might feel that their girlfriend's well-being is at stake, and the friend's behavior is toxic. In that case, the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to stop further harm, especially if the friend is unrepentant.\n\nOn the other hand, sending private messages to the friend's mom could be seen as crossing a line, even if the friend was wrong. It's a form of retaliation and might not be the most mature way to handle the situation. The author could be using the friend's mom to exert pressure, which might not be fair or effective. Also, the group chat context means that the friend's comments were in a public space among friends, so the author might have had other options like confronting him directly or involving other friends to mediate.\n\nBut the key points here are the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment. The author's girlfriend is in a very vulnerable state, and the comment was not just about weight but tied to her medical condition. The friend's response dismisses the author's concern, which could indicate a pattern of disrespect. In such cases, the author might feel that their usual methods (talking to friends, confronting) aren't enough, and involving the parent could be a last resort to make the friend understand the seriousness of their actions.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, the author's action might be a response to a breach of trust and a failure of the friend to take responsibility. While sending the screenshot isn't the most ideal approach, the intent is to address a harmful comment made in a group setting. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend's dignity and their own respect in a situation where the friend is not showing empathy. Given the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive context, the author's actions might be understandable, even if not perfect.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the author is not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
