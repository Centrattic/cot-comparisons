All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the writer's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The writer tried to confront the friend but didn't get a remorseful response. The friends in the group chat are hesitant to take sides, and the writer is considering escalating the issue to the friend's mom to hold them accountable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong for this action. On one hand, the friend's behavior was inappropriate, and the writer had a valid reason to be upset. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of revenge or escalation that might not be fair. However, considering the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the writer's action might be justified as a way to address the issue when their own attempts to resolve it failed.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. The writer might be protecting their girlfriend's feelings and standing up against bullying. But could this action damage friendships or relationships? The writer mentions that others in the group don't know how to respond, so maybe they felt they had to take matters into their own hands. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. While it's not a perfect solution, the intention was to address a serious issue where the friend showed no remorse. The writer might believe that the friend's actions were harmful enough to warrant involving a parent, especially if the friend is a minor. \n\nSo, based on the context, the answer would lean towards the writer not being in the wrong because the friend's behavior was offensive and the writer's action was a response to protect their partner and seek accountability.\n"
