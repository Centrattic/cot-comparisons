All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author considered sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a comment that was clearly hurtful and targeted the author's vulnerable girlfriend. The author tried to address it directly but the friend dismissed it. Now, the author is contemplating escalating the situation by informing the friend's mom. \n\nThe key points here are the nature of the friend's comment, the author's response, and the potential consequences of sending the screenshot. The friend's joke is not just teasing; it's a direct attack on someone with serious health issues. The author's reaction is understandable given the context of their girlfriend's medical struggles. However, the method of addressing it\u2014sending a screenshot to the friend's mother\u2014could be seen as a breach of privacy and possibly an overreaction. \n\nBut considering the lack of remorse from the friend and the potential for ongoing harm, the author might feel justified in seeking external intervention. The friends in the group chat aren't supporting the author, so involving the friend's parent might be a way to hold the friend accountable. However, there's a risk of damaging relationships and creating more conflict. \n\nLegally, there's no issue with forwarding messages, but ethically, it's more complex. The author's intent is to stop the friend's harmful behavior, which is in the girlfriend's best interest. The alternative of confronting the friend directly didn't work, so the author is trying another approach. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the friend's actions were genuinely malicious and the author is trying to protect their partner, then maybe not. But using a screenshot to the friend's mom without considering the consequences could be seen as harsh. However, given the severity of the comment and the friend's dismissive response, the author's actions might be justified as self-defense for their girlfriend's well-being. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The decision depends on the balance between holding the friend accountable and the method used. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, the author's reaction, while questionable in method, is driven by a desire to protect their partner. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
