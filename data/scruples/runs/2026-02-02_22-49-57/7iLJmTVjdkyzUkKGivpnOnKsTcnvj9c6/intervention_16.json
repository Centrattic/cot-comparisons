All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to his mom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author tried to confront the friend but didn't get a proper apology. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue without escalating it in front of other friends.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the friend's comment, the context of the girlfriend's health struggles, and the author's intent in sharing the screenshot. The friend's joke was not just a harmless joke; it targeted someone with serious health issues, which is cruel. The author's girlfriend is facing significant health challenges, so the comment was deeply offensive and insensitive.\n\nNow, considering the author's action. They want to hold the friend accountable but don't want to escalate the situation publicly. Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be a way to inform the parent about the behavior without involving others. However, sharing someone's private messages without consent is a privacy violation. But in this case, the author is using it to address a serious issue that was not resolved through direct communication.\n\nThe moral dilemma here is between respecting privacy and addressing a harmful action. The friend showed no remorse, and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings and their own relationship. The author isn't trying to humiliate the friend in front of others but to involve the parent to possibly correct the friend's behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. On one hand, sharing the screenshot breaches privacy. On the other, the friend's comment was unacceptably cruel, and the author's intent is to address it. The context of the girlfriend's health is crucial here\u2014a joke about her condition when she's already suffering is unforgivable. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking the issue seriously, so involving the parent could be a necessary step.\n\nComparing this to the friend's actions, which were clearly in the wrong, the author's response, while not perfect, is driven by a desire to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. The author isn't escalating for revenge but seeking a resolution. The potential for the friend's mom to address the issue with him might lead to a better understanding of the impact of his words.\n\nSo, while the author's action isn't ideal, the context of the friend's harmful comment and lack of remorse makes the author's intent more understandable. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
