All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sending a screenshot of a friend making a cruel joke about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The friend made a comment implying that the girlfriend is fat because of her medical condition, which the author is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend said something insensitive about the author's girlfriend, who has a serious medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. The friend showed no remorse and even dismissed the author's concern. The friends in the group chat are unsure how to handle it, and the author is frustrated and wants to take action without escalating in front of others.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to send the screenshot. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The friend made a hurtful comment targeting someone vulnerable due to her health. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable by showing the comment to his mom. However, sending it to the mom could be seen as confronting the parent directly without giving the friend a chance to apologize or take responsibility. On the other hand, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, and the author is trying to address it in a way that avoids public escalation in the group chat.\n\nPossible angles: The author's intent is to address the hurtful comment, which is justified. However, the method (screenshot to the mom) might be seen as a breach of privacy or an overreaction. But considering the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author might feel justified. Also, the friends are not taking a side, so the author is acting independently. The line between accountability and revenge is thin here. If the author's action is meant to inform the parent so the friend can be addressed, it's a responsible step. If it's to humiliate the friend, then it's problematic. The post doesn't indicate malice, just frustration. The author is trying to avoid escalating in front of others, which shows some consideration. \n\nLegally, sharing someone's private message without consent could be an issue, but the context is about a harmful statement. Ethically, protecting a loved one from being mocked for their medical condition is a strong point. The friend's comment was a direct attack on someone's health condition, which is a serious matter. The author's action is a form of standing up for their girlfriend and addressing the friend's behavior. However, the appropriateness of involving the parent might be debatable. But given the friend's nonchalance, the author might not have other options left. \n\nIn summary, while the method might be questionable, the underlying reason is valid. The author is reacting to a serious insult towards someone in a vulnerable state. The friend's lack of remorse and the context of ongoing health issues make the author's frustration understandable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
