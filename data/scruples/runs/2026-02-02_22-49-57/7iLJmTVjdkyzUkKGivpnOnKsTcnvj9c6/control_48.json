All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, leading to the author considering sending a screenshot of the message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The friend made a hurtful joke targeting the girlfriend's health condition, which is a serious and sensitive issue. The author responded by telling the friend he went too far, which seems reasonable. But then the author is considering escalating the situation by showing the message to the friend's mom. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong here? The key points to consider are the context of the friend's comment and the author's potential actions. The friend's comment is clearly cruel, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author's intention is to address the friend's behavior, but the method involves involving the friend's parent without the friend having a chance to apologize or take responsibility. \n\nSending the screenshot could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might not be the most constructive approach. However, given the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author might feel that this is a necessary step to hold the friend accountable. The author also mentions that other friends haven't taken a side, so they might be seeking support or validation. \n\nOn the other hand, escalating the issue to a parent without first giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize could be considered overstepping. However, the original comment was extremely insensitive and potentially harmful. The author's actions might be justified as a response to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's lack of empathy. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's intentions are to confront the friend's inappropriate behavior, but the method might be questionable. However, the severity of the initial comment's cruelty and the friend's dismissive response (\"Don't talk shit then\") might make the author's actions more understandable. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. The key is whether the action of sending the screenshot is proportionate and appropriate. Since the author is trying to address a serious issue and the friend shows no remorse, the author might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
