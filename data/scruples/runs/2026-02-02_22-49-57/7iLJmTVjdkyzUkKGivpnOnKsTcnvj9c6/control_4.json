All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend's health issues related to chemo. The friend didn't apologize and was dismissive. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The friend said something harmful, especially targeting someone with a serious medical condition. The author's girlfriend is going through a lot, so the comment was not just a joke but hurtful. The friend's response was to say \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse. \n\nNow, the author is thinking of taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mom. Is this the wrong thing to do? Well, the friend's actions were clearly inconsiderate and hurtful. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, but the method might be questionable. \n\nIn some contexts, involving parents can be a way to address the issue, especially if the individuals are young (the author is 18). However, the author is using a private group chat message and sharing it without consent. That could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the friend was in the wrong. \n\nBut then, the friend's comment was a public attack on the author's girlfriend, which is a serious matter. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. The screenshot might be a way to show the friend's mom the inappropriate behavior he's engaging in, which could be educational for the mom about her son's behavior.\n\nHowever, there's a line between accountability and retaliation. The author might be seeking some form of justice, but doing it behind the friend's back could be seen as underhanded. Also, the group chat might be considered a private space, so sharing that information could be problematic. \n\nBut considering the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse, the author might feel that this is the only way to address it since their other friends aren't taking sides. It's a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not entirely clear-cut. The friend's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's method of dealing with it might not be ideal. However, given the context of the friend's inconsiderate behavior and the author's attempt to address it without escalating publicly, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The harm caused by the friend's comment is significant, and the author is trying to address it. While the method of sending a screenshot to the mom might be a gray area, the friend's actions were worse, so the author's intent is to correct harmful behavior, which might justify the action despite the privacy concern.\n"
