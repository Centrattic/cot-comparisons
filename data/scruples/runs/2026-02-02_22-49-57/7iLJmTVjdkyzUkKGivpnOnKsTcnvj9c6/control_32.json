All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The friend made a derogatory comment targeting the girlfriend's health condition, which is clearly inappropriate and cruel. The author tried to respond in the moment but the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is thinking of reporting the friend's comment to his mom, which is part of a group chat where they usually cover for each other. \n\nThe author's actions here are a response to a direct personal attack on their girlfriend. The friend's comment was not a joke but a malicious remark that adds insult to the girlfriend's medical struggles. The author is seeking to hold the friend accountable, maybe to get him to face consequences for his words. However, the method of sending a screenshot to his mom could be seen as a form of retaliation or escalation, but given the context, it's a reaction to a serious offense.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and proportionality. The author's intent is to address the friend's harmful comment, which was directed at someone vulnerable. The friend's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, especially knowing the girlfriend's health issues. The author's response, while possibly aggressive, is in defense of their partner and to confront the friend's lack of empathy. \n\nIn terms of morality, while the author is using a method that might be considered underhanded (since they usually cover for each other), the underlying issue is the friend's toxic behavior. The author is not directly attacking the friend's family but using a strategic approach to make him face the consequences. The wrong here seems to lie more with the friend for making the harmful comment, not the author for trying to address it, even if the method is questionable.\n"
