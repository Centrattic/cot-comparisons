All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author tried to respond in a light-hearted way first but was met with a hurtful remark. The friend showed no remorse, so the author is considering escalating by showing the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the friend's actions. Making a joke about someone's girlfriend's health issues is clearly inconsiderate and cruel. The friend's comment targeted the girlfriend's physical condition, which is sensitive given her medical struggles. That's the core issue here.\n\nNow, the author's response: they confronted the friend first, which is reasonable. When that didn't work, they're considering sending a screenshot to his mom. The user is asking if this action makes the author wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author is defending their girlfriend and addressing a hurtful comment. The friend's behavior is unacceptable. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as involving parents unnecessarily or escalating the conflict in a way that might not be the most appropriate. But given the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author might feel this is necessary to address the issue.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friend's comment was not just a joke but targeted a vulnerable situation. The author tried to handle it privately but failed. Involving a parent could be a way to hold the friend accountable, especially if he doesn't take responsibility. However, some might argue that the author should have handled it another way, like involving a mutual friend or a teacher, but given that they mention the group chat friends aren't taking sides, maybe involving the parent is justified here.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a response to a serious transgression. While the method might be questionable, the motivation is to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's harmful behavior. The friend was in the wrong first, so the author's actions might be justified as a form of accountability. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
