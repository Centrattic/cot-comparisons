All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and experiencing health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a joke targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition, which is extremely sensitive. The author tried to address it, but the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of accountability. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's comments are clearly hurtful and inappropriate. The author is trying to stand up for their girlfriend's dignity. However, the method of confronting the issue by involving the friend's parent might be seen as escalatory or a breach of privacy. But given the severity of the comment, especially in relation to a health condition, some might argue the author is justified in holding the friend accountable.\n\nThe law might not be the main factor here, as it's a social issue. But ethically, the line is blurry. The author could be seen as protecting their partner, which is a valid concern. However, the action of forwarding the message to the parent might be considered a breach of trust or an overstep in handling conflict. \n\nI think the key points are the severity of the friend's insult and the lack of remorse from him. The author's options are limited since their other friends aren't taking sides. If the friend's mom is aware of his behavior, she might address it. But the author's action could be seen as a way to make the friend face consequences, which is understandable. On the other hand, using underhanded methods (like hiding things from parents) might suggest the author isn't above the same tactics, but in this case, it's for a different reason.\n\nIn conclusion, while the action might not be the most conventional, the author's intent to protect their girlfriend's well-being is important. The friend's actions are clearly the wrong, so the author's response, though not ideal, is a reaction to protect their partner's dignity. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
