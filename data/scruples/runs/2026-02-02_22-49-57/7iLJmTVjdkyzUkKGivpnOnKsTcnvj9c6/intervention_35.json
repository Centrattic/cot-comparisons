All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is battling serious health issues. The friend's comment was about her weight and her medical condition, which the author finds deeply offensive. The author then sends a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom. \n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for doing that? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the details, the friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and shows a lack of empathy. The author's girlfriend is going through a tough time with her health, and making a joke about her weight and appearance during chemo is insensitive. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" after being confronted suggests he's not taking responsibility, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nNow, the author's action was to escalate the situation by informing the friend's mom. The group chat friends are also present but haven't taken sides yet. The author mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents, but this time they're considering doing the opposite.\n\nIn terms of morality, the friend's initial comment was wrong, but the author's response involves exposing the friend's behavior to his mother. This could be seen as a form of revenge or using a parent's authority to teach a lesson. However, using a parent's involvement might not be the best approach, especially if the friend is a minor (the author is 18, so the friend might be 17 or younger). Parents often have a role in guiding their children's behavior, so perhaps the author is using that to address the issue.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's action is justified given the context. The friend's comment was cruel and targeted the author's vulnerable girlfriend. The author might feel that confronting the friend directly didn't work, so involving the parent is a way to ensure the friend understands the seriousness of his words. However, some might argue that the author should have handled it through other means, like reporting the friend or addressing it without involving parents.\n\nThere's also the mention of the friend's personal issues (his real dad leaving him), which the author could use, but they choose not to. This suggests the author is aware of the friend's background but still feels justified in their actions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is protecting their girlfriend and standing up against bullying. The friend's behavior is harmful, and the author's action could lead to the friend facing consequences, which might prevent future incidents. However, the method of informing the parent could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the friend was not aware that his words were being reported.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action is a response to a hurtful comment. While the method might be questionable, the motive is to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's insensitivity. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The key is whether the action was a proportionate response. Since the friend's comment was deeply offensive and the author felt that direct confrontation wasn't effective, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a justified step to address the issue, even if it's not the most ideal method. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
