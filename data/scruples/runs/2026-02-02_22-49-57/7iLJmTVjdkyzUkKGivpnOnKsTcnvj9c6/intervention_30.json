All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation first.\n\nThe author's friend made a comment about the girlfriend who's going through chemo, which is really serious. The friend called the girlfriend a \"bitch,\" and then made a joke about her weight, referencing her medical condition. The author confronts the friend, but the friend dismisses it. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom, which is the crux of the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's actions. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially chemo and lupus, seems cruel and insensitive. The friend's comments were offensive and targeted someone who's already suffering. The author's girlfriend's health is critical, so this was a low blow.\n\nThe author tried to address the issue directly but was met with no remorse. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" suggests defensiveness and a lack of empathy. The author is clearly upset and wants to protect their girlfriend's feelings, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the action in question is sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The author is considering this as a way to hold the friend accountable without escalating the situation in front of others. The group chat is a place where they've hidden things from parents before, so this might be a way to address it without involving others.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior was clearly offensive, and the author is trying to address it. However, involving the friend's mom might be seen as a breach of privacy or an overstep. It could also lead to unintended consequences for the friend and their family. But if the friend is unrepentant and the comments were hurtful, some might argue the author has a right to act to protect their girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, taking the screenshot and sending it could be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a constructive resolution. It might damage the friendship further and could be perceived as not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. However, given the context of the friend's callousness, the author's frustration is justified.\n\nThe key factors here are the severity of the friend's comments, the author's intent to address the issue, and the potential consequences of sending the screenshot. The author's intent is to hold the friend accountable for targeting their girlfriend's sensitive condition. Since the friend showed no remorse, the author might feel justified in using this method to make a point. However, it's a gray area because it involves exposing the friend's private messages to a parent, which could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might say that the author is protecting their girlfriend, which is right, but the method is questionable. Others might see it as a necessary step given the friend's unrepentant behavior. The author's options are limited because the friend isn't listening, and the other friends aren't taking sides. So, the author feels compelled to take a stronger action to stop the harassment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer depends on how one views the balance between protecting a vulnerable person and the ethics of exposing someone's private messages. Given the context, I think the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to address a serious issue that was directed at someone who's already vulnerable. The friend's actions were inexcusable, and the author's response, while possibly harsh, stems from a place of protecting their girlfriend. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
