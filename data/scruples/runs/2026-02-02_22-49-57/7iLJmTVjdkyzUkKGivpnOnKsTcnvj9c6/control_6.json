All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend made a really offensive comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has a medical condition causing her to be swollen. The author sent a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's weight and health, which is sensitive because she's sick. The friend didn't seem to apologize or take it back, just said \"Don't talk shit then.\" So the author felt wronged and wanted to address it somehow.\n\nNow, the author's action was sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. I need to think about whether that's justified. On one hand, the friend's comment was clearly hurtful and possibly cruel, especially given the girlfriend's health situation. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility, so confronting him directly might not work, so involving the parents could be a way to hold him accountable.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is using a method that might be seen as underhanded. They're not talking to the friend directly or seeking a resolution through other means first. Instead, they're leaking a private chat to a parent, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust or an escalation. However, the context is that the friend's behavior is particularly harmful and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend's well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the action was a proportionate response. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a personal attack on a vulnerable person. The author might feel that the friend's actions are so egregious that revealing it to his mom is necessary to stop the behavior and prevent further harm. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's a tricky situation. If the author had gone to the friend first and there was no resolution, then involving the parent might be a reasonable step. However, if the author bypassed any direct confrontation, it could be seen as avoiding a more mature approach. But given the friend's lack of remorse, maybe the author didn't have a choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the friend's actions were inexcusable and the author was trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings. The action, while perhaps not ideal, was motivated by a desire to address a serious issue. But maybe there's a better way, so maybe the author is partially at fault. However, given the severity of the friend's comment, the author's response is understandable.\n"
