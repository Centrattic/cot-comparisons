All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom. The situation involves the friend making a joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a cruel comment targeting the girlfriend's medical condition, which is a very sensitive topic. The author tried to address it directly but the friend didn't show remorse. Now the author is considering reporting it to the friend's mom to get a reaction.\n\nIs the author justified in this action? The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author might feel that confronting the friend directly didn't work, so involving the parents could be a way to hold the friend accountable. However, sending a screenshot without context could be seen as a privacy violation or an escalation. But considering the severity of the comment, some might argue it's a reasonable response to address the friend's lack of empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions could damage their friendship and potentially lead to more conflict. But given the friend's dismissive attitude, maybe the author is protecting their girlfriend and standing up for her. The key points are the intent to address a harmful comment and the lack of remorse from the friend. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area, but the friend's comment was definitely in the wrong. The author's action is a form of seeking justice for the harm caused. However, the method might not be the best, but the intent is understandable. So, likely the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
