All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing serious medical treatment. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the girlfriend's health issues, which are serious and sensitive. The author's reaction is understandable given the context. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial comment was wrong. The key here is whether the author's response is proportionate and appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was clearly inconsiderate and hurtful, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author has a right to be upset and wants to hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's mother might not be the best approach. It could lead to further conflict and might not address the underlying issue effectively. The author's friends are also caught in the middle, not taking sides, which complicates things further.\n\nThe author's intention is to retaliate rather than resolve the issue. Instead of confronting the friend directly or seeking a resolution through appropriate channels (like talking to him privately or seeking mediation), the author is opting for a more aggressive and private action. This could be seen as the author taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and stand up for her, but the method chosen could backfire or cause more harm than good.\n\nIn terms of moral and ethical considerations, the author has the right to defend their partner, but the method of doing so is questionable. Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom might be considered an invasion of privacy or an act of revenge, which could put the author in the wrong. The friend's comment was indeed inappropriate, but the author's response might not align with constructive conflict resolution. Therefore, while the friend's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line, making them partially at fault.\n"
