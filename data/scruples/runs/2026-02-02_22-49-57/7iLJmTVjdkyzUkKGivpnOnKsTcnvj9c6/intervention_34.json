All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a cruel joke about their girlfriend who's going through chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend said something really hurtful and offensive, targeting the girlfriend's health issues. The author confronted him, but the friend didn't apologize. The author is considering taking it to the friend's mom to make a point without escalating in front of others.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend's comment was truly hurtful and the author is trying to hold him accountable, maybe sending the screenshot is justified. But there's a line between accountability and retaliation. The author is using a strategy that might embarrass the friend or make his mom aware, which could be seen as a form of punishment. However, the friend's comment was inconsiderate, especially given the girlfriend's medical situation. The author's actions could be seen as a way to protect their girlfriend and stand up for her. \n\nOn the other hand, involving parents might be a breach of trust or privacy. But the original comment was in a group chat, so the screenshot sharing could be a way to show the mom the inappropriate behavior. Also, the friend doesn't seem remorseful, so the author might feel it's necessary to take action. \n\nI think the key here is the intent. The author's intent is to address a hurtful comment and possibly teach the friend a lesson without public escalation. If the friend's actions were indeed malicious, then the author's response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, is in line with protecting their partner. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
