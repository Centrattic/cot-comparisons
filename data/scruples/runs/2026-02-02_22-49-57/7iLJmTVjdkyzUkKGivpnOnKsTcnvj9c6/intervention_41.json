All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive message to his mom. The friend made a comment about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo, which is really sensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a personal attack related to the girlfriend's medical condition. The author felt that the friend had no remorse and was trying to escalate the situation. The author's options were either to confront the friend in front of others or take a more direct approach by involving the friend's mom. \n\nNow, the ethical part. Is it right to report someone's private message to their parent? On one hand, the author is trying to address a harmful comment towards someone vulnerable. On the other, it's a breach of privacy and might be seen as retaliatory. The friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, but the author's method could be seen as taking it too far. However, given the severity of the comment and the girlfriend's health situation, the author's actions might be justified as a necessary step to hold the friend accountable, especially if other methods (like talking to him directly) didn't work. \n\nAlso, the friend's lack of remorse is a key factor. If he's not taking responsibility, the author might feel that involving the parent is the only way to make him understand the seriousness. But there's a line between defending someone's dignity and crossing into personal retaliation. The answer hinges on whether the action was proportionate and necessary. In this case, the comment was particularly cruel given the girlfriend's condition, which adds weight to the author's decision. So, while it's not ideal, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
