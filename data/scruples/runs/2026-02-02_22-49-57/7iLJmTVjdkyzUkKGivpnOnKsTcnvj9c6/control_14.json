All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their \"friend\" making fun of their girlfriend who's undergoing chemo to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a really hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with chemo and lupus complications, leading to her being swollen and bloated. The friend's comment was about her weight, which is a sensitive issue given her health. The author tried to respond in a playful way, but the friend escalated it with a cruel remark. The author then confronts the friend, who shows no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom to maybe teach him a lesson or make him stop.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for doing this? Let's break it down. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, especially targeting someone who's already ill. The author's intention here is to address the friend's behavior, but the method involves exposing the comment to the friend's parent. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. The friend's actions were bullying, which is wrong. On the other hand, sending the screenshot could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, given the context of the joke being about a serious health issue, the author's action might be justified as a way to stop the harassment. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of how they're handling it. The author mentions that they usually help this friend hide things from his parents. This time, they're breaking that norm. But since the friend has no remorse and the comment was so harmful, maybe the author is justified in this exception. \n\nThe key factors here are the severity of the friend's comment and the author's intent. If the author's goal is to make the friend understand the impact of his words and prevent further harm, then it's a form of intervention. However, others might argue that the author should handle it differently, like confronting the friend directly or involving a trusted adult. Still, given the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the joke, some might see the author's action as a necessary step to protect their girlfriend and address the bullying.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's action, while perhaps not the most conventional, is a response to a harmful situation. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The line between standing up for someone and taking matters into their own hands can be thin. However, considering the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (No).\n"
