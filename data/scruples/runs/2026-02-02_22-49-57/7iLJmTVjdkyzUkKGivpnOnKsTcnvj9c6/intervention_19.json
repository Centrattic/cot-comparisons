All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The author sent a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The friend made a derogatory comment towards the author's girlfriend, who's dealing with serious health issues. The author tried to respond but the friend escalated it. Then, the author took a screenshot and sent it to the friend's mom. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: The friend's comment was clearly insensitive and hurtful, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author tried to address it directly but the friend showed no remorse. The author then took a more drastic step by informing the friend's mother. \n\nNow, considering the options: Answer A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to weigh the moral aspects. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was inappropriate and the author was defending their girlfriend. On the other hand, informing the friend's mom without consulting others might be seen as crossing a line, even if the motive is justified. However, given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the comment, the author might feel that escalation was necessary to protect their girlfriend and set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the group chat dynamics\u2014others didn't take sides. The author might feel unsupported. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be a way to involve an authority figure to address the issue. It's a form of accountability, especially if the friend isn't taking the matter seriously. \n\nBut is it wrong? If the author's intention was to stop the friend from making such comments and to protect their girlfriend, maybe the action was justified. However, bypassing the friend and going straight to the parent could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. The friend might have been given a chance to apologize, but since he didn't show remorse, the author might have felt that this was the only way to make him understand the seriousness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the action might be morally ambiguous, the underlying intent to protect a vulnerable person and hold the friend accountable could support the author's decision. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
