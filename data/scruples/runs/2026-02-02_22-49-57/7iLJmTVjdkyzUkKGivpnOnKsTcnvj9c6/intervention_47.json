All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment about his girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a cruel joke targeting the girlfriend's health condition, which is a very sensitive and serious issue. The author tried to confront the friend but was dismissed. The friend showed no remorse, so the author is considering escalating the situation by sharing the conversation with the friend's mother.\n\nNow, the moral dilemma here is whether taking this action is justified. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inconsiderate, especially given the girlfriend's medical struggles. The author is in a group chat where others are present but haven't taken a side. The author's options are limited since confronting the friend directly didn't work.\n\nThe key points to consider are: 1) The friend's comment was targeted at someone vulnerable, 2) The author's intent is to hold the friend accountable, 3) The method chosen is sharing the screenshot with the friend's mom. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If we look at the friend's behavior first, he was clearly in the wrong by making a cruel joke about someone's health. The author's response is a form of retaliation, but it's in defense of their partner. However, sharing private messages with a parent without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the motive is justifiable. \n\nBut considering the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, the author might feel that traditional social boundaries are breached, making the action a necessary step to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. The parents might not be aware of their child's behavior, so this could be a way to address it from another angle.\n\nOn the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the parents could lead to more conflict and might not be the best approach. However, given the friend's dismissive attitude, the author might feel it's the only way to make an impact.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while the action might not be the most conventional, the context of the friend's cruelty and the girlfriend's vulnerable state supports the author's intent. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
