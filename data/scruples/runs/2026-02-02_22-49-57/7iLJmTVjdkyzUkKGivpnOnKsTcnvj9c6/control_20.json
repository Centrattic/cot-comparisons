All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, and the author considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend made a joke targeting the author's girlfriend's weight and health issues, which is serious because the girlfriend has a medical condition causing her to gain weight. The author tried to respond in a playful way initially but then confronted the friend. The friend didn't apologize, and the author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot to his mom.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the friend's comment was clearly targeting someone vulnerable (the girlfriend with a health issue), the friend showed no remorse, and the author is considering a private retaliation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider if sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is justified. On one hand, the friend crossed a line by making a joke about a serious health issue. On the other hand, escalating by involving the friend's mom might be seen as crossing a line as well. But the context is important here. The friend has shown no remorse, and the author is trying to address the hurtful comment without escalating in front of others.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the friend's actions were clearly inappropriate. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable. However, sending the message to the mom is a form of retaliation that might not be proportionate. But given the severity of the comment and the lack of apology, some might argue it's justified to let the friend's parent know about his behavior.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If I think that the author's action is a reasonable response to a hurtful and disrespectful comment, then answer B (No). If I think that the author's action is crossing a boundary even in response to the friend's behavior, then answer A (Yes). \n\nBut given that the friend targeted someone with a serious health issue, and there was no apology, the author's action might be seen as a way to protect their girlfriend and address the disrespect. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. However, the act of sending the message to the mom could be seen as violating privacy or using a parent to discipline the friend, which might be a gray area. \n\nBut considering the context, the author isn't just retaliating out of spite; they're trying to address a serious issue. The friend's comment was about a vulnerable person, so the author's action is about protecting their girlfriend. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
