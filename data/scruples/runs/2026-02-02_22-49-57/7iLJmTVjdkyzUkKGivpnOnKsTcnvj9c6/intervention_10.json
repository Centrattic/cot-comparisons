All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive message to his mom. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author tried to confront the friend, but he dismissed it. Now the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially when it's as serious as chemo and lupus, is not okay. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so this joke is hurtful and shows a lack of empathy.\n\nThe author tried to address the issue directly but didn't get a satisfactory response. The friend showed no remorse, which is a problem. The author is frustrated and considering escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom. \n\nNow, the question is whether sending the screenshot is wrong. On one hand, the friend's comment was unacceptable, so the author has a valid reason to be upset. On the other hand, involving the friend's mom might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. The friends often hide things from parents, so the author might be breaking that norm.\n\nBut here, the friend's behavior crosses into bullying or harassment. The author's girlfriend's health is a serious matter, so the joke is not just a joke but a cruel one. The author's action could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend isn't taking responsibility. However, some might argue that the author should have taken a different approach, like confronting the friend again or involving other friends.\n\nThe key points are the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse. If the author's intention is to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's harmful behavior, sending the evidence to the mom could be a justified action. However, it's important to consider the potential consequences, like damaging the friendship or causing unintended harm to the friend's family. But given the context, the author's actions might be seen as a necessary step to address the inappropriate behavior, especially if other methods didn't work.\n"
