All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author in this scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is 18, and their friend made a really offensive comment in a group chat. The friend insulted the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo, lupus, and kidney issues, causing her to be swollen and bloat. The friend's comment was about her weight, implying that she's fat, which is definitely cruel given her medical condition.\n\nThe author responded by telling the friend he went too far, but the friend dismissed it with \"Don't talk shit then.\" Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom. The other friends don't know how to handle it and haven't taken sides. Also, there's a hint that the author might bring up the friend's real dad leaving him, which could be a sensitive topic too.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The friend made a hurtful joke about someone with a serious illness. The author is protecting their girlfriend by confronting the friend but now considering escalating by involving the friend's mom. Is this justified?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's comment is unquestionably wrong. Mocking someone's health issues is cruel and shows a lack of empathy. The author is trying to stand up for their girlfriend, which is a valid concern. However, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom might be seen as a violation of privacy or a form of retaliation. The author is trying to avoid public escalation in front of other friends, so maybe they want to handle it privately. But if the friend isn't showing remorse, maybe the author feels justified in involving the parent to get a message through.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key is whether their action is proportionate and appropriate. The friend's behavior was inexcusable, but the author's response could have consequences. If the author's girlfriend is vulnerable due to her health, it's important to protect her dignity. However, taking the issue to the friend's mom might be seen as crossing a line, even if the friend was first to act inappropriately. Alternatively, maybe it's a necessary step to hold the friend accountable, especially if other methods have failed.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they and their friends often help the friend hide things from his parents. This context might mean that the author is breaking a norm they usually follow, which could affect the judgment. But since the friend's actions were so hurtful, the author might feel justified in going against that norm this time.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend's actions are clearly wrong. The author's action is a form of confrontation, but the method\u2014screenshotting and sending to the mom\u2014could be seen as a personal retaliation rather than a formal complaint. However, given the severity of the friend's comment, some might argue that the author is just trying to address the issue without involving more people publicly. \n\nI think the author's intent is to protect their girlfriend and stop the bullying, which is right. The method they choose (sending the screenshot) is a private way to address it, but whether it's wrong depends on the situation. Since the friend showed no remorse and the comment was exceptionally cruel, the author might be justified. However, if the friend's family isn't aware of the context, the screenshot might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
