All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through serious health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend made a comment about the girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive topic because she's undergoing chemo and has health complications causing her to be swollen and bloat. The author tried to respond in a playful way, but the friend escalated by making a derogatory remark. The author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, considering the context, the friend's comment was hurtful and insensitive. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so making fun of her appearance during such a time is definitely crossing a line. The author tried to address it directly but the friend dismissed it. \n\nThe author's action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of seeking accountability. However, using someone else's parent to do this might not be the best approach. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend's initial behavior is clearly wrong. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and stand up for her. But using a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a private escalation. However, given the context of the friend's cruel comment, the author might feel justified. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of how to handle such conflicts. The author is in a group chat where others are complicit in hiding things from the friend's parents. This suggests a pattern of covering for the friend's behavior. The author might feel isolated in wanting to address it.\n\nLegally and ethically, if the friend's comment is a threat or harassment, the author has a right to report it. However, sending it to the mom might not be the most appropriate method, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nThe author's actions are a response to a hurtful comment, so while the method might be questionable, the intent is to stop further harm. Therefore, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to protect their girlfriend and seek some form of justice, especially when the friend shows no remorse.\n"
