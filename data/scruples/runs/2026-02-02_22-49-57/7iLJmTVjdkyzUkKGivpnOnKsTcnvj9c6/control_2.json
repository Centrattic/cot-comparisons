All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy whose friend made a cruel comment about his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has lupus. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a really insensitive joke targeting the girlfriend's health issues. The author confronts him, but the friend doesn't apologize and even says \"Don't talk shit then.\" The author is frustrated and considering sending the message to the friend's mom to teach him a lesson or get his mom involved.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend's comment was clearly cruel and targeted someone vulnerable. The author's reaction is in response to this insult. However, the method he's considering\u2014sending the screenshot to the friend's mom\u2014is a form of retaliation. Even though the friend was in the wrong, the author is using a strategy that involves involving the friend's parent, which could be seen as escalation or a breach of privacy.\n\nBut wait, the group chat includes friends who might be hiding things from the friend's parents, so the author is using a method they've used before. The friends haven't taken sides yet. The author is under pressure from a bad situation\u2014his girlfriend is very ill, and the friend's comment is particularly cruel. The author is trying to protect his girlfriend's dignity and hold the friend accountable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's original comment is undeniably wrong. The author's action is a form of retaliation, but it's a response to a harmful joke that's targeting someone who's already suffering. The screenshot might serve as a lesson for the friend to be more considerate, but it's also a private message sent to a parent without the friend's knowledge. This could be seen as a privacy violation, but given the context of the friend's behavior, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for his girlfriend and confronting a friend who was cruel. On the other hand, involving the parent without a clear public confrontation might be seen as underhanded. However, the alternative of saying something about the friend's real dad (a sensitive topic) was considered but not used. The author chose a different method.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's initial action was clearly wrong. The author's response, while not ideal, is a reaction to protect his girlfriend and address the friend's lack of remorse. The key here is the proportionality of the response. The friend made a hurtful comment, and the author is trying to correct that behavior. The method might not be perfect, but the intent is to stop further harm. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
