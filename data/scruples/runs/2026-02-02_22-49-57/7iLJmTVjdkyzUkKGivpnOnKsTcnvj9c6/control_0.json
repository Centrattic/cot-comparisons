All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment about their girlfriend to the friend's mom. The friend made a really hurtful joke about the girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel, targeting someone who's already vulnerable. The author was upset and wanted to hold their friend accountable. The options are to say A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nOn one hand, the author's friend made a hurtful joke, which is inconsiderate and shows a lack of empathy. The author felt that confronting the friend directly wasn't enough, so they took the step of informing the friend's mom. This could be seen as a way to get the friend to understand the seriousness of their words, especially given the mom's role in their lives.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is using a method of retaliation by exposing the friend's comment to his mom, which might not be the healthiest approach. However, considering the context of the friend's comment being so offensive and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author might feel justified. The author also mentions that they don't want to escalate things in front of other friends, so this method could be seen as a last resort. \n\nThe key factors here are the severity of the friend's comment, the author's intent to address the issue, and the appropriateness of the method used. While involving a parent isn't always the best path, given the friend's dismissive attitude (\"Don't talk shit then\"), the author might not see another way to make the friend take responsibility. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the group chat dynamics. The author and their friends often hide things from this friend's parents, so using that same method against him could be seen as a form of accountability. However, it's a bit of a double standard if they usually protect him but now are using that to their advantage. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and stand up against bullying, which is commendable. But the method of sending the screenshot to the mom might be crossing a line, even if the intent is good. It's a judgment call between right and wrong based on the circumstances. \n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might be seen as a form of revenge, given the seriousness of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, there's a gray area here. The main question is whether the author's action was a justified response to the friend's cruelty. Since the friend showed no remorse and the author felt other avenues weren't working, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Maybe in some perspectives, the author is wrong for using a screenshot to the parent, but considering the context, it's a tricky situation where the author is trying to correct a harmful action.\n"
