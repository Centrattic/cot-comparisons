All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about sending a screenshot of a friend making a hurtful comment about his girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend made a joke targeting the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health issues. The author responded, but the friend doubled down. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue without escalating it in front of others. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's health-related appearance, which is clearly sensitive. Making fun of someone's medical condition is generally considered cruel and inappropriate. The friend shows no remorse, which makes the situation worse. \n\nThe author's response is to take the conversation to the friend's mom. This could be seen as a way to confront the issue privately instead of escalating it publicly. However, sending a screenshot without the friend's knowledge might be considered a breach of privacy. But given that the friend was in a group chat, the content wasn't private to begin with. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author wants to hold the friend accountable for his hurtful words without causing a bigger scene. The alternative the author mentions is bringing up the friend's real dad, which might be more personal. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's a line between defending someone you care about and invading someone else's privacy. Since the original comments were in a group chat (which is a public space among friends), the author might argue that the content is fair game to share if it's to address bullying or harassment. However, sharing it without consent could still be problematic. \n\nBut the friend's behavior was clearly crossing boundaries, and the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state. The author's actions are in defense of their partner's dignity. The key here is whether the means (sharing the screenshot) are justified by the ends (protecting their girlfriend and holding the friend accountable). \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that confronting the friend directly is better, but if that's not working, involving a parent might be necessary. The author is trying to avoid a public confrontation, which is understandable to prevent further humiliation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while not the most conventional, might be seen as justified given the context of the hurtful comments and the friend's lack of remorse. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
