All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's action is justified. The friend's comment is clearly cruel and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author is angry and wants to confront the friend but feels that sending the screenshot to his mom is a way to address it without escalating in front of others.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is definitely inappropriate, and the author has a right to be upset. However, the method the author is considering\u2014sending the screenshot to the friend's mom\u2014might be a form of retaliation. The key here is whether this action crosses the line into being as bad as the friend's comment.\n\nThe friend made a hurtful joke about the girlfriend's appearance due to her illness. The author's response is to expose the friend's comment to his mom. While the friend's words were cruel, the author's action is a private matter. However, the author is using the friend's own words against him, which some might see as a justified consequence. Others might argue that it's not the author's place to do that, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nBut considering the context, the friend showed no remorse and was dismissive. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the joke is particularly hurtful. The author's intention is to hold the friend accountable, especially since others in the group aren't taking sides. The act of sending the screenshot to the mom is a way to inform the parent about the inappropriateness of the son's behavior. \n\nHowever, some might say that airing the friend's words publicly (even if it's just to his mom) is not the right approach. But given the severity of the joke and the friend's lack of remorse, the author is trying to correct harmful behavior. \n\nIn terms of morality, the line is blurry. But since the friend's actions were clearly wrong and the author is trying to address it in a way that doesn't involve public escalation but rather private accountability, the author's intent is understandable. The action might be harsh, but it's a response to a serious offense. Therefore, the answer is more likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
