All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a cruel joke about their girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who has a serious medical condition. The author responds by sending the screenshot to the friend's mother. The key points here are the nature of the comment, the intent behind the action, and the context of the relationship between the individuals.\n\nThe friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and insensitive, given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author felt that the friend had no remorse, which adds to the tension. The author is considering escalating the situation by involving the friend's mother, which could be seen as a form of retaliation or a way to address the harassment indirectly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone makes a cruel joke about a serious health issue, especially in a group chat where others are present, the person targeted has a right to be upset. However, the method of response matters. Sending a screenshot to the friend's mother without giving the friend a chance to address the issue directly could be seen as bypassing accountability. It might also escalate the situation in a way that could harm the friend's reputation or family dynamics.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014multiple friends are involved, the friend shows no remorse, and the author is trying to avoid public escalation in front of others who haven't taken sides\u2014it's a complex situation. The author might feel that this action is necessary to hold the friend accountable, especially if the friend doesn't take responsibility. However, the appropriateness of the action is debatable. While the friend's comment was definitely in the wrong, the author's response could also be seen as crossing a line by involving the mother without a direct conversation first.\n\nBut then again, if the author has tried to address it and the friend dismisses it, seeking another form of recourse might be understandable. The line between standing up for oneself and escalating the conflict is thin here. There's also the aspect of privacy\u2014sharing a private conversation without consent could be problematic, regardless of the motive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action is taken to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable, perhaps it's a justified response. But if it's done out of anger without considering the consequences, maybe it's not the best approach. However, since the friend showed no remorse and the situation is serious, the author's reaction might be seen as a necessary step to prevent further harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are not ideal, especially considering the potential for further conflict and the invasion of privacy, the context of the friend's cruel and insensitive remarks, coupled with a lack of accountability, might make the author's actions understandable. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
