All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemotherapy. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a joke that was not only disrespectful but also targeted the author's girlfriend's health condition. The girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, so the comment was particularly hurtful. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend dismissed it, showing no remorse.\n\nNow, the author is contemplating taking this to the friend's mother. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (author is not wrong). I need to evaluate the morality here. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, and the author feels that the friend isn't taking it seriously. The author is frustrated and wants to take action without causing a public scene, hence considering sending the screenshot to the mom.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for doing this? On one hand, the friend's actions were inconsiderate and crossed a line. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable condition, so making fun of her health is not just a joke. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend isn't showing any remorse. \n\nHowever, the author is using a private message to the friend's mother as a way to handle the situation. This could be seen as a form of indirect confrontation. But given the context, the author is not directly attacking the friend but informing the parent about the friend's inappropriate behavior. The author's intention is to address the issue without escalating it publicly, which might be a way to handle it more privately.\n\nConsidering that the friend's comment targeted someone's serious health condition, the author's action might be justified as a way to make the friend understand the severity of his words. The author isn't spreading the comment around but is using a private message to convey the message through the parent. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were the initial problem, and the author is trying to address it without further public humiliation.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
