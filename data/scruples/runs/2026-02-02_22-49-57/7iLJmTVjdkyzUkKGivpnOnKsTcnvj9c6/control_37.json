All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to parse this situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a male in a group chat where a friend made a comment targeting his girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has health issues. The friend's comment was about her being \"400 pounds\" and a \"fatass,\" which is clearly a sensitive topic given her medical condition. The author responded by sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom, considering whether this was the right thing to do.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nThe friend made a cruel and insensitive joke about the author's girlfriend's health. The girlfriend is dealing with serious medical problems, including kidney failure and lupus, which caused her to gain weight. Making a joke about someone's appearance during a time of illness is generally considered inconsiderate and harmful. The friend's response after being reprimanded (\"Don't talk shit then\") shows a lack of remorse, which might be a reason for the author to take further action.\n\nThe author's action was to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. This is a form of reporting the friend's behavior without their knowledge. There's a moral dilemma here: is it right to inform the friend's parent about such a comment? On one hand, it's exposing the friend's disrespectful behavior, which could lead to consequences. On the other, it's a privacy violation and might be seen as retaliatory or an overreaction.\n\nThe author mentions that they often help this friend hide things from his parents. That suggests a pattern of covering up for the friend, but in this case, the friend's comment is particularly hurtful. The author is conflicted between maintaining the friend's privacy (as they usually do) and addressing the friend's harmful behavior.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the initial comment by the friend is clearly wrong and harmful. The author's response is an attempt to hold the friend accountable. However, sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as crossing a line. Instead of confronting the friend directly in the group chat, the author chose to involve the friend's parent, which might not be the best approach. It's possible that the friend's mom might overreact or that the situation could escalate beyond the author's control. Additionally, the author's friends are described as not taking sides yet, so maybe the author didn't want to create conflict in the group.\n\nBut the author's intention is to stop the friend from making such comments again. Since the friend showed no remorse, the author might feel that involving a parent is necessary. However, the rightness of this action depends on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics. In some contexts, involving a parent could be justified to address serious disrespect. In others, it might be considered an invasion of privacy, even if the comment was wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The initial comment from the friend is clearly inappropriate, and the author's motivation is to protect their girlfriend. But the method of retaliation might not be the best. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to address the friend's harmful behavior, but sending the screenshot could be a questionable approach. However, given the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the comment, the author's action might be seen as justified. The key points here are the intent to stop further harm and the context of the friend's history. Since the friend's behavior was malicious and the author is taking steps to prevent it, the author might not be in the wrong, but there are nuances. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author is responding to a serious breach of respect and is trying to protect their girlfriend, even if the method is debatable. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any other angles here. Maybe the act of informing a parent without the friend's consent is considered wrong, regardless of the content. That's a possible counterpoint. However, given the severity of the comment, the author's action might be seen as necessary. So I think the correct answer is B, but I'm a bit conflicted because the method could be seen as underhanded.\n"
