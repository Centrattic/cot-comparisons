All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about their girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has lupus. The friend's comment was about her weight, which is a sensitive issue because her medical condition causes her to be swollen and bloat. The author tried to call him out, but the friend dismissed it. The author considers sending the screenshot to the friend's mom but is unsure if it's the right thing to do.\n\nNow, the key points here are the context of the friend's comment and the author's intended action. The friend's joke is clearly hurtful and insensitive, targeting someone's health condition. That's a serious issue. The author's motivation is to address this offensive behavior, but they're concerned about escalating the situation or violating privacy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the friend's comment is unacceptable and the author has a valid reason to be upset. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as an invasion of privacy or an overreaction. However, considering the severity of the friend's words and the author's girlfriend's health issues, some might argue that the author is justified in taking this step to hold the friend accountable.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. The group chat friends aren't taking sides, and the author feels they can't address it in front of them. The mention of helping the friend hide things from his parents suggests there's a pattern of covering for him, which might make the author feel that this is a necessary action to stop the behavior.\n\nBut is there a better way to handle it? Maybe. The author could have considered talking to the friend privately, getting support from mutual friends, or involving a teacher or counselor if it's a school setting. However, the author might not have tried all those options, feeling that the friend is unrepentant.\n\nUltimately, the question is whether the action is wrong. If the friend's comment was genuinely harmful and the author's intent is to stop further harm, then some might see the action as justified. Others might think the author should have handled it differently. But given the context, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
