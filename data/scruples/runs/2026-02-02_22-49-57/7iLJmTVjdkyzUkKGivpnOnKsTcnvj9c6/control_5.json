All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend made a derogatory comment in a group chat about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has lupus. The author then considers sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment was targeting the girlfriend's weight and health issues, which is a sensitive topic given her medical condition. The friend showed no remorse, just said \"Don't talk shit then.\" The author is frustrated and considering taking a drastic action by informing the friend's mom. \n\nNow, the key points here: The friend's joke was not only cruel but also targeted someone with a serious health condition. The author is defending their girlfriend, which is understandable. However, sending a screenshot to the mom could be seen as a form of retaliation or escalation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial comment by the friend is clearly offensive. The author's response in the group chat was to challenge the friend, but when that didn't work, considering sending the screenshot to the mom is a step they're conflicted about. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action. On one hand, they're standing up for their girlfriend, which is commendable. On the other hand, involving the mother might not be the best approach. However, the friend's behavior was inexcusable. The author's action, while maybe not the most constructive, is in response to the friend's harmful comment. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend was the one who made the inappropriate comment. The author is trying to address the situation in a way they feel is necessary, even if it's not the most diplomatic. They aren't the one who started the harm, so they aren't at fault here.\n"
