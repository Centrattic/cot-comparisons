All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health issues including chemo, lupus, and kidney problems. The friend's comment is about her weight, which is a result of her medical condition and treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment was not only offensive but also targeted someone with a serious illness. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, targeting the girlfriend's health-related condition. The author felt the need to escalate by involving the friend's parent, possibly as a form of retaliation. The author's intent here is to hold the friend accountable for his harmful words. However, sending the screenshot to the mom might be seen as a breach of privacy or an overreaction, but it's also a way to inform the parent about their child's behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was inexcusable, and the author has a right to be upset. On the other hand, escalating the situation to the parent could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the author is using this as a form of punishment or to get back at the friend for other reasons (like hiding things from parents). The author mentions that they all help the friend hide stuff, so maybe there's a history of covering for him, which adds complexity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the friend's comment was wrong, the author's response might not be justified. However, given the severity of the comment and the girlfriend's health situation, the author's reaction is driven by protecting their partner. The moral dilemma is between taking a private matter public (to the parent) versus dealing with it among friends. \n\nConsidering that the friend showed no remorse and the comment was about a vulnerable person, the author's action could be seen as a protective measure. But sending the screenshot might be inappropriate as it invades the friend's privacy and could damage relationships. However, given the context, the author's intent was to address the harm done, not just retaliate for personal reasons. \n\nSo, weighing the actions: the friend's comment is clearly the wrong, but the author's response is questionable. However, the author might not be entirely at fault because they're trying to address a serious issue. But the method of addressing it (involving the parent without considering the consequences) could be seen as the wrong approach. However, given the severity of the comment, maybe it's understandable. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the principle of proportionality matters. The harm caused by the friend's comment is significant, so the author's reaction might be seen as a proportionate response to hold the friend accountable. Alternatively, there might be better ways to handle it, but the author's intent is justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's action is a response to a serious offense, even if the method is questionable. However, there's a nuance here. The author is using the group chat's usual behavior (helping hide stuff) against the friend, which complicates things. But the core issue is the friend's cruel comment about a sick person. So, the author's action is a form of accountability, which is morally acceptable even if the method is debatable. Hence, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
