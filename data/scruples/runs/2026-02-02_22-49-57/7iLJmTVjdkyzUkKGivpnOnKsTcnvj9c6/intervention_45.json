All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend making a hurtful comment about their girlfriend's medical condition to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the key points: The friend made a cruel joke targeting the girlfriend's chemo-related weight gain and health issues. The author felt their friend was out of line, but when confronted, the friend was dismissive. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue.\n\nNow, considering the context. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a personal attack on someone with a serious medical condition. The author's girlfriend is going through significant health struggles, so the comment is especially insensitive. The friend shows no remorse, which adds to the severity of the situation.\n\nThe author's action is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. This could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable, especially since the group chat isn't addressing it. However, sending private messages to a parent without consent might be seen as a breach of privacy. But in this case, the comment was made in a group chat, which is a public space among their peers. The author might argue it's a form of intervention to get the friend to stop the harmful behavior.\n\nEthically, is the author justified? The friend's actions were hurtful and showed disrespect towards someone's health. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend by addressing the friend's behavior. While using a parent might be a contentious method, the alternative could be inaction given the friend's lack of remorse. The author's intent is to stop the harassment, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut there's a line between standing up for someone and escalating the situation. The author might not be in the wrong because the initial comment was clearly inappropriate. However, the method of addressing it by involving the parent could be seen as harsh. But given the context of the friend's repeated insensitivity and the group's inaction, the author might feel this is necessary.\n\nIn summary, the friend's behavior was the real issue. The author's action is a response to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's toxic behavior. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
