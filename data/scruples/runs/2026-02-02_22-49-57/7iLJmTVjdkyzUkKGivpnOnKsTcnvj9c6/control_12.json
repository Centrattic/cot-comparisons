All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author wants to send a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a joke that was really insensitive, referencing the girlfriend's health condition. The author was upset and tried to respond, but the friend didn't apologize. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a way to address the situation without confrontation in front of friends.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong for wanting to do that. On one hand, the friend's comment was cruel and targeted someone vulnerable. The author's intention might be to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend shows no remorse. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of revenge or escalation. However, given the context of the friend's callousness and the fact that the author's friends aren't stepping in, maybe the author feels they have no other recourse.\n\nI should also consider the moral aspect. The friend's behavior is clearly wrong, but the author's response might be seen as crossing a line by involving the friend's parents. However, if the friend's actions are harmful and he's not being held accountable, the author might feel justified. It's a tough balance between privacy and protection.\n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the author is in the right to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's toxic behavior, especially if other methods haven't worked. The key points are the insensitivity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse. The author's action is a response to protect their partner and seek some form of accountability. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
