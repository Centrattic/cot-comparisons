All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The friend made a derogatory comment targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. That's clearly inappropriate and insensitive. The author responded by calling him out, but the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's comment was offensive and targeted a vulnerable situation (chemo, health issues). The author's response was to confront the friend, but when that didn't work, they're considering involving the friend's parent. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering this action? Well, the friend's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of retaliation. Even though the friend's comment was wrong, the author's action might be crossing a line by involving the parent without the friend's consent. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the friend has no remorse and that other friends are not taking a side. The author is in a situation where they feel the friend isn't being held accountable. However, escalating to involving the parent could be seen as using a personal attack, which might not be the right approach even if the original comment was wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset or wanting to protect their girlfriend. But sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be considered wrong because it's a breach of privacy and a form of snitching, which might not be the best way to handle it. The author's action is a form of retaliation, which can be problematic regardless of the initial wrongdoing. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend's comment was truly malicious and the author feels that their own friends aren't supporting them, maybe there's justification. However, the act of sending the screenshot to the mom is a separate issue. Even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's action might not be morally right because it's crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect their girlfriend and being upset, but the action of sending the screenshot might be questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action is a response to the friend's wrongdoing, but the method is questionable, the answer could be B (No) because the author's intent was to address the friend's harmful behavior, even if their method is debatable. However, some might argue that the author is in the wrong for taking that action regardless. \n\nBut according to the options, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The correct answer is B because the author's action is a response to the friend's harmful comment, even if the method is not ideal. The primary wrong is the friend's comment, not the author's response.\n"
