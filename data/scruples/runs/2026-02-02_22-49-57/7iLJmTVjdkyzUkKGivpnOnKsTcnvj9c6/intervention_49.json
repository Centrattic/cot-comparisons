All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive remarks to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a comment about the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemotherapy and has health issues. The comment was about her weight and was clearly hurtful. The author tried to confront the friend but was met with a dismissive response. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue without escalating it publicly.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The friend's remarks were cruel and targeted someone who's already in a vulnerable health condition. The author's intention is to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend shows no remorse. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of involving a parent without the friend's knowledge, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut then, the friend has shown no regard for the girlfriend's condition and dismissed the author's concerns. The author is trying to teach the friend a lesson and stop the harassment. In some contexts, involving a parent might be a justified action to address serious bullying or harmful behavior, especially if the friend isn't responding to direct confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the method of involving the parent without prior discussion could be seen as underhanded. However, given the severity of the comments and the friend's lack of remorse, the author might feel that this is the only way to make the friend understand the gravity of their actions.\n\nSo weighing both sides, the friend was in the wrong for making those comments, and the author's action is a response to that. While the method might not be the most ethical, the intent is to address a serious issue. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
