All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, and the author considering sending a screenshot of that joke to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend made a comment that's clearly offensive, targeting the girlfriend's health condition. The author defends her by making a joke about the friend's appearance, which escalates the situation. The friend then makes another derogatory remark about the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her medical issues. The author is upset and considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The initial comment from the friend is definitely inappropriate and hurtful. The author's response was a bit of a jab, but maybe that's just typical banter among friends. However, when the friend then makes a comment about the girlfriend's medical condition, that's where the line is crossed. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the friend's remarks are not just teasing but harmful.\n\nThe author's plan is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. Is that justified? Well, the friend's behavior is crossing into serious territory by mocking someone's health issues. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, albeit through a private, behind-the-scenes action. The question is whether this action is acceptable. On one hand, it's confronting the issue without public escalation, which could prevent further humiliation. On the other hand, it's a breach of privacy and could lead to unintended consequences for the friend's family.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014his girlfriend's severe medical condition and the friend's lack of remorse\u2014it's a situation where the author is trying to protect their partner. The friend's actions are inexcusable, and the author's response, while not the most conventional, might be seen as a necessary step to address the harm done. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their girlfriend's dignity and health, even if the method is a bit underhanded. The key is the motivation: protecting someone vulnerable from cruel remarks.\n"
