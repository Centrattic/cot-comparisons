All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive message to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's dealing with serious health issues.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and showed a lack of empathy. The author tried to confront him but the friend didn't show remorse. Now the author is considering escalating the situation by involving his friend's mom. \n\nI need to consider the context: the girlfriend's medical condition, the friend's dismissive attitude, and the author's frustration. The author's actions are a response to a violation of trust and respect. While sending the screenshot might be a private matter, the intent here is to address the friend's harmful behavior. \n\nThe key factors are the severity of the offense, the lack of apology from the friend, and the potential consequences. The author might be justified in trying to get the friend to face the consequences through his parent. But some might argue it's airing the issue inappropriately. \n\nHowever, given the friend's disregard and the girlfriend's health struggles, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary step to hold the friend accountable. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
