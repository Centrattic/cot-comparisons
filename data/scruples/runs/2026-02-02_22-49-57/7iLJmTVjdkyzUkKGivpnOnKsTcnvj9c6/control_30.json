All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend made a comment that's clearly hurtful and insensitive, targeting the author's girlfriend's medical condition. The author responds in a way that seems like a playful jab, but then the friend escalates with a derogatory remark about the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her health issues. \n\nThe author then confronts the friend, who dismisses it with \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address this, maybe to make the friend understand the severity, but also to avoid public confrontation in the group chat where others are hesitant to take sides.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the friend's offensive comment, the author's intention to retaliate by sharing the screenshot with the friend's mom. \n\nLegally, sending a screenshot of a private conversation might be a breach of privacy, but the context here is about moral and social wrongs. Ethically, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel. The author's action is a form of retaliation, but it's done to hold the friend accountable for his hurtful words. \n\nHowever, the author's justification is that the friend showed no remorse and the comment targeted a vulnerable situation (the girlfriend's health). The author might be trying to protect their partner and seek justice, but using a private message against the friend could be seen as crossing a line, even if the original wrongdoing was severe.\n\nBut considering the context, the friend's comment was not just a joke but a direct attack on someone's health condition. The author's action is a response to a lack of accountability. In some perspectives, the author is trying to address a serious issue by escalating it to the friend's parent, which could be seen as a necessary step rather than a wrongdoing. \n\nHowever, others might argue that the author shouldn't take matters into their own hands and that confronting the friend directly or involving others in a different way would be more appropriate. But given the friend's dismissive attitude and the severity of the comment, the author's action might be justified as a form of defense for their partner.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's retaliation is proportionate and justified. The friend's initial comment was clearly in the wrong, and the author's action is a response to protect their partner. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
