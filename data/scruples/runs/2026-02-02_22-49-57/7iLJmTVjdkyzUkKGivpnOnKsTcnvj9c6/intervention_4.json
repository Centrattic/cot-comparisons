All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's friend made a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend's joke was about her weight gain and health, which is really sensitive. The author confronted the friend, but he didn't apologize. Now the author is considering sending the screenshot to his mom to address this.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was the friend's comment inappropriate? Yes, definitely. Making fun of someone's health issues, especially when they're seriously ill, is wrong. The author's girlfriend's condition is a major factor here. The friend showed no remorse when confronted. \n\nThe author's options were limited. They didn't want to escalate things in front of others, and their friends were neutral. They considered using the friend's real dad leaving him as a counter, but maybe that's not the best approach. \n\nNow, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable. The mom might be able to address it with her child. However, it's a private conversation, and the author is sharing a private message they were part of. But the original message was in a group chat, so the privacy aspect is a bit murky. The group chat is public among the friends, but sharing it with the mom is a different step.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions were clearly hurtful. The author's action is a form of taking the situation to the parent, which might be seen as a parent's role to discipline. But in some contexts, people might argue that the author should have handled it another way first, like talking directly or seeking mediation. However, given the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the comment, the author might feel they have no other options.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that sharing the message without consent could invade the friend's privacy or escalate the situation. But considering the context, the author's action is in response to a serious offense against their partner. \n\nSo, balancing the friend's wrongdoing against the author's response: the author's action, while not ideal, is a reaction to a severe personal attack. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
