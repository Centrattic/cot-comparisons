All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The joke was about her being \"400 pounds\" and the friend's comment was clearly hurtful. The author confronted the friend, but the friend showed no remorse. Now the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to escalate the situation, as their other friends haven't taken a side.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's comment was extremely insensitive and hurtful, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author is upset and feels wronged. The proposed action is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom, which is a form of retaliation or bringing the issue to the parents. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend crossed a serious line by making a joke about someone's health condition. The author had a right to be upset. However, the method of response could be problematic. Telling the parents might be seen as a violation of privacy or an overreaction, depending on the context. But considering the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse from the friend, some might argue that the author is justified in wanting to address the behavior, especially if the friend isn't taking it seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, using a screenshot to involve the parents could be seen as a breach of trust in the group chat, and maybe even a form of cyberbullying or doxxing the friend. The author is using a tactic that the group often uses to hide things from parents, but in this case, they're doing the opposite. \n\nMoral and ethical considerations come into play. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings and hold the friend accountable. However, the method of accountability is questionable. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms, but generally, when someone makes a hurtful comment, especially about a sensitive health issue, the person who is wronged might have a right to take some action, even if it's not the most conventional. \n\nSo, in this case, the friend's comment was inexcusable. The author is upset and looking for a way to make the friend stop. While sending the screenshot to the mom is a strong move, given the context, it's a response to serious bullying. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, as they're trying to address a hurtful situation. But there's a nuance here where the action could be seen as revenge rather than a constructive solution. However, given the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author might be justified. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
