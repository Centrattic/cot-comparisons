All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her medical condition. The author tried to confront the friend, but he dismissed it. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a way to hold him accountable without escalating in front of others. They mention that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents, which adds context about their relationship dynamics.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the friend's comment was offensive and hurtful, targeting someone vulnerable. The author's action is to expose the friend's behavior to his mom. On one hand, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate, and the author might feel justified in taking action. On the other hand, sending the screenshot could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if the friend's actions were wrong.\n\nThe author's intent is to hold the friend accountable, but doing so by involving his mom might be considered a breach of privacy or a form of revenge. It's a question of whether the author's method of addressing the issue is appropriate. However, given the severity of the friend's comment and the friend's lack of remorse, some might argue that the author is taking a stand against bullying, which is understandable.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. The author is trying to avoid confrontation in front of others, which shows they don't want to publicly humiliate the friend but still want to address the issue. However, involving the friend's mom could have consequences beyond what the author intends, like damaging relationships or causing unnecessary stress to the friend's family.\n\nIn terms of morality, the friend's behavior was clearly wrong, but the author's response might be seen as a form of justice. Yet, there's a debate about whether exposing someone's actions without their consent is ethical. The line between standing up for someone and taking matters into their own hands can be thin here.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action is a response to a hurtful and disrespectful comment. While it's not a perfect solution, the intent is to address the wrongdoing. The friend's comment was inexcusable, and the author is protecting their girlfriend's dignity. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here about how to handle such situations ethically.\n"
