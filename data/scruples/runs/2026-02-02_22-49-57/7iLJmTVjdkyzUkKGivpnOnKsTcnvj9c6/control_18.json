All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. The situation involves the author's girlfriend who's undergoing serious health issues, including chemo and kidney problems. The friend made a cruel joke about the girlfriend's weight, which is a direct result of her medical condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was not only rude but potentially hurtful, given the girlfriend's health. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed it, showing no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of accountability.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the friend's behavior was inconsiderate and harmful. The author's reaction is driven by defense of their girlfriend. However, escalating the conflict by involving the friend's mom without prior attempts to resolve it through other means might be problematic. It could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the author didn't give the friend a chance to apologize or if the action is done in a vengeful manner. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend's behavior is consistent and malicious, the author might feel justified in seeking intervention. The key factors here are intent and proportionality. If the author's intent is to stop further harm and the method is proportionate, maybe it's understandable. But since the author is using a private message (screenshot) that was meant for friends, sharing it without consent could breach privacy, which is a negative aspect. \n\nHowever, considering the severity of the comment related to someone's health issues, some might argue it's necessary to protect their partner's well-being. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. But in terms of right or wrong, the act of sending the screenshot could be seen as wrong because it's a form of retaliation without direct communication first. The correct approach might be to address the friend directly again, involve mutual friends, or seek other resolutions before involving parents. So the author could be in the wrong for not exhausting other options first.\n"
