All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to screenshot their friend's offensive comment to his mom is in the wrong. The friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend who has a serious illness. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The friend said something cruel about the girlfriend's weight and health, which is directly related to her medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom as a response.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend showed no remorse. The author is frustrated and possibly seeking a way to hold the friend accountable. \n\nSending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of confrontation. It's a private matter being escalated to the parent, which might not be the best approach, but the friend's comment was a public humiliation in a group chat. However, the author's intent is to stop the harassment and prevent further harm. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is a proportionate response. The friend's comment targeted someone with a serious health issue, which is a sensitive topic. The author's reaction is driven by protecting their girlfriend and addressing the friend's lack of empathy. \n\nIn terms of morality, the friend's behavior is clearly wrong. The author is trying to correct it. While involving the parent might be seen as a harsh move, it could also be a necessary step if the friend isn't taking responsibility. The author isn't retaliating for personal reasons but to address a harmful statement. \n\nSo, considering the context and the intent behind the action, the author isn't in the wrong. Their action is a response to a serious issue that needs addressing, even if the method is questionable. The friend's behavior was worse, so the author's reaction is more about seeking accountability.\n"
