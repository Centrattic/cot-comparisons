All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment about his girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has health issues, to their friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend's health. The author tried to confront him but the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to teach him a lesson.\n\nNow, the key points. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a hurtful remark about someone's serious medical condition. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so the joke is particularly insensitive. The author's intent here is to stop the friend from continuing this behavior, possibly to get his parents involved to correct him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of retaliation. But considering the context\u2014the friend's comment was malicious, and he refused to take responsibility\u2014this might be a justified action to protect their partner and hold the friend accountable. The author is not directly confronting the friend publicly in front of others, which could cause more harm, but instead using a private method to address the issue. However, there's a risk that this could be seen as crossing a line by involving the friend's family without his knowledge. \n\nBut given the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of his comment, the author's actions might be a necessary step to prevent further harm. The alternative was to either say nothing or confront the friend again, which didn't work. The author's goal is to make the friend understand the seriousness of his words. In this light, the author's actions, while maybe not the most diplomatic, are driven by a desire to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's toxic behavior. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
