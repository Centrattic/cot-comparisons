All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a cruel comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo, and then the author considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend, who is very ill and swollen due to medical issues. The friend's comment is clearly insensitive and harmful. The author confronts the friend, who responds dismissively. Now the author is considering escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, even though they usually hide things from parents.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the friend's comment, the author's response, and the potential consequences of sending the screenshot. The friend's remark targets the author's girlfriend's medical condition, which is extremely inappropriate and shows a lack of empathy. The author's intention in sending the screenshot is likely to hold the friend accountable or to get the friend's mom involved because the author feels the friend is unrepentant.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If we consider the friend's behavior as the main issue, the author is reacting to a hurtful comment. However, the author's action of sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge or consent could be seen as a violation of privacy or a form of retaliation. Even if the friend was wrong, the author's method of addressing it might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were clearly offensive, but there's a debate about the appropriate response.\n\nOn one hand, the author is defending their girlfriend and trying to hold the friend accountable for a cruel joke. On the other hand, involving the friend's mom might escalate the situation and could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the group usually hides things from parents. The author's motivation is understandable, but the method might not be the most ethical or constructive. However, given the severity of the friend's comment, some might argue that the author is justified in seeking a response to protect their girlfriend's dignity.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the friend's actions were in the wrong, and the author is trying to address a serious issue. The screenshot is a way to escalate the matter when direct confrontation hasn't worked. The moral of the situation is more about the friend's insensitivity than the author's response. So, the answer is B.\n"
