All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this (let's call him \"the author\") is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of his friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend, who's going through a very serious medical condition. The friend's comment was in a group chat, and he said something about the author's girlfriend's weight and his intention to \"fuck her,\" which is clearly inappropriate and insensitive given her medical struggles. The author confronts him, but the friend brushes it off, showing no remorse. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this exchange to the friend's mom, possibly to get the parents involved.\n\nNow, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for doing that. The user thinks he's not, but wants to know my opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior here is definitely problematic. Making a joke about someone's medical condition, especially one as severe as chemo, kidney issues, and lupus, is not just rude\u2014it's cruel. The friend showed no empathy and dismissed the author's concerns. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the friend's comment is both inappropriate and hurtful. So, the friend is clearly at fault here.\n\nNow, the question is about the author's actions. The author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom. Let's consider the possible consequences. On one hand, the author is trying to address the issue and make the friend take responsibility. The friend's behavior is toxic and needs to be corrected. By involving the parents, the author is seeking a higher level of accountability. On the other hand, some might argue that the author is retaliating or escalating the situation by involving the parents without giving the friend another chance to apologize. However, given that the friend has already shown no remorse and the comment was so insensitive, the author might feel that this is the only way to get through to him.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the intent. The author's intent is to protect his girlfriend's feelings and address the friend's harmful behavior. The action of sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of conflict resolution, especially if direct confrontation hasn't worked. However, there's a line between seeking accountability and seeking revenge. If the author's goal is to make the friend understand the severity of his actions, then it's a valid approach. But if the author is just trying to get back at the friend for the comment, that's different.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that they all help the friend hide stuff from his parents. This suggests that there's a pattern where the friend might be used to getting away with things because his parents aren't involved. The author's action could be seen as correcting that pattern, ensuring that the friend faces consequences.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy. The group chat was a private conversation, and sharing a screenshot without consent could be a privacy breach. However, the content of the message is about a serious issue, and the author is sharing it to expose the friend's harmful behavior. The balance here is between respecting privacy and addressing something that's clearly abusive.\n\nIn terms of the moral aspect, the author is trying to stand up for his girlfriend and address a situation where someone else is being cruel. The friend's actions are the root problem here. The author isn't the one being cruel; he's responding to it. While the method of involving the parents might be questionable, the intent is to correct wrongdoing rather than cause harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. He's taking steps to address a friend's harmful behavior that's impacting his girlfriend. The friend's actions are the issue, not the author's attempt to hold him accountable through the parents. The method might be debatable, but the intent is justified.\n"
