All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a hurtful and insensitive comment targeting someone who's already going through a tough time. The author felt it was necessary to escalate the issue by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author's girlfriend is vulnerable due to her health, and the friend's comment was not just a joke but a personal attack. The author's response was to involve the friend's parent, which could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable or to seek support where the friend shows no remorse. However, sending private messages to someone's parent without their consent could be seen as a breach of privacy and potentially escalating the conflict in a public way, which might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, and the author might feel that they've tried to address it within their peer group without success. The friends in the group chat aren't taking a side, so the author might feel isolated. In this case, the author's action could be viewed as a necessary step to address the friend's harmful behavior when other methods have failed.\n\nBut I should also consider the potential consequences. Sending a screenshot to a parent could damage the friend's reputation, affect family relationships, and might not be the most constructive way to handle the situation. It's possible that the author didn't consider the long-term effects or the friend's perspective, but given the severity of the comment and the girlfriend's health issues, the author might feel that the friend's actions were malicious and deserving of consequences.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a grey area. The author's intent was to stop the friend from making such comments and perhaps teach him a lesson. However, the method used could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author didn't have the friend's consent to share the message. Privacy is a factor here; the group chat messages were private, and sharing them without permission could be a violation of that privacy.\n\nBut given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the joke, the author's action might be justified as a form of protection for their girlfriend and as a way to address the friend's toxic behavior. The community aspect\u2014friends not taking sides\u2014might have pushed the author to take more direct action.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer might hinge on whether the action was proportionate and necessary. The author's girlfriend's health issues add a layer of sensitivity, making the joke particularly hurtful. The decision to involve the friend's mom could be seen as a last resort when other avenues (like confronting the friend directly or seeking support from other friends) haven't worked.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method might not be the most ideal, the author's intent to address a serious issue and protect their girlfriend could mean they're not in the wrong. However, there's a case to be made that the action could be seen as crossing a line by breaching privacy and escalating the situation. But given the circumstances, the author's action might be morally acceptable.\n"
