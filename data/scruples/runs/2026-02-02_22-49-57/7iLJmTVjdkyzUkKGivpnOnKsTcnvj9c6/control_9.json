All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the author's friend made a comment in a group chat about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has lupus, causing her to be swollen and bloated. The friend called the author's girlfriend a \"400 pound fatass.\" The author is considering sending a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and targeted the author's girlfriend, who is going through a serious medical condition. The author intervened by telling the friend he went too far, but the friend showed no remorse. The author is frustrated and considering taking action by informing the friend's mom as a way to hold him accountable without escalating further in front of others.\n\nNow, the key points to evaluate: Was the friend's comment acceptable? Probably not. It was a personal attack on someone who is vulnerable due to health issues. The author's girlfriend's health is a significant factor here. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and stand up for her, which is understandable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for sending the screenshot? Well, the author is using a method that could be seen as retaliatory. However, given the context of the friend's comment being inconsiderate and cruel, the author's action might be a way to make the friend realize the seriousness of his words. The author mentions that the friend has no remorse, so maybe this action is a way to get through to him. \n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as going behind the friend's back. But considering the friend's lack of remorse and the context of the original insult, the author might feel that this is a necessary step to address the situation. It's a form of accountability, especially since others in the group are not taking a side. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle it privately or through other means rather than involving the friend's family. But given the severity of the comment and the health issues involved, the author's action could be justified as a way to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. The friend's comment was inappropriate, and the author is trying to hold him accountable, even if the method is unconventional. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
