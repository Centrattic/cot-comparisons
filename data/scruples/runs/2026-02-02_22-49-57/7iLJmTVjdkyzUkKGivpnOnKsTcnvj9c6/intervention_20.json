All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo. The author tried to respond in a group chat but the friend doubled down, showing no remorse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was targeting someone with a serious medical condition, which makes it particularly hurtful. The author's reaction seems to stem from a place of defending their girlfriend and being upset by the friend's lack of empathy. \n\nNow, the action taken is sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. This could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. On one hand, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, and the author might feel that their friends in the group chat aren't taking it seriously. On the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's parent could be seen as crossing a line, especially if there's an existing pattern of hiding things from parents. \n\nBut considering the severity of the friend's comment and the fact that he showed no remorse, the author might feel they have no other option. The friends in the group aren't stepping up, so the author is left to act alone. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that defending against a targeted, cruel joke, especially one involving someone's health, is justified. \n\nHowever, the act of sending it to the mother might bypass the friend's accountability in a public way. But given the situation, it's a form of seeking help when others aren't helping. The friend's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, so the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to address it, especially since the friend is unapologetic. \n\nSo weighing the options, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions warranted a response, and the author had limited support from peers. The key factors here are the severity of the friend's comment, the lack of remorse, and the author's attempts to address it without further escalation in the group chat.\n"
