All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. The friend made a cruel comment about the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author tried to respond in a way they thought was playful, but the friend escalated it with a hurtful remark. Now the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend's comment was not just a joke but targeted the author's girlfriend's medical condition, which is incredibly sensitive. The author's girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, so the comment is not just rude but malicious. The friend shows no remorse when called out, which adds to the severity.\n\nNext, the author's options: confronting the friend directly didn't work. The group chat friends are hesitant to take sides. The author is considering using a method they know the friend's mom will see (screenshot) to expose the comment. The alternative is to mention the friend's real dad leaving him, which could be a personal attack but might be a way to get the friend to back off.\n\nThe question is whether sending the screenshot is justified. On one hand, it's a private message being shared without consent, which could be seen as a violation of privacy. On the other hand, the comment was hurtful and targeted a vulnerable person. The author's intent is to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend isn't showing remorse.\n\nEthically, this is a gray area. The friend's comment is clearly wrong, and the author's girlfriend's health issues make the comment even more despicable. The author is trying to protect their partner and address the friend's behavior. However, involving the friend's mom might be seen as a breach of privacy. But if the friend is in the wrong and refuses to change his behavior, the author's actions could be a form of seeking justice or intervention.\n\nConsidering the context\u2014serious health issues, lack of remorse from the friend, and the potential for escalation\u2014the author's actions might be justified as a protective measure. The alternative (mentioning the friend's past) could be seen as equally inappropriate or even more so. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially since they tried to address it directly first.\n"
