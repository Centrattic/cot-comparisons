All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their \"friend\" making a joke about their girlfriend who's undergoing chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a derogatory comment targeting the girlfriend's appearance, which is a result of her medical condition. The author felt the comment was cruel and invasive, especially since the girlfriend's health is very serious. They responded to the friend but he dismissed it, so the author is considering taking a more drastic step by sharing the screenshot with his mom to show him how inappropriate his behavior was.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and disrespectful. The author is trying to confront this behavior, but in a way that involves a third party (the mom). The question is whether this action is justified. On one hand, the author is protecting their girlfriend from further harm, which is compassionate. On the other, involving the friend's mother could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if the friend was in the wrong. \n\nThe author mentions that they and their friends often cover for each other when hiding things from their parents, which implies there's a history of secrecy. However, the friend's actions here were particularly harmful, targeting someone with a serious medical condition. That's a strong ethical violation. \n\nThe key factors here are the intent and the context. The author's intent is to hold the friend accountable for his hurtful comments, using a method that avoids direct confrontation with their friends who are neutral. The friend showed no remorse, so the author might feel that escalating the situation to his mom is necessary to teach him a lesson. \n\nBut is this escalation justified? The author is using a private message (the screenshot) and sharing it with the friend's mother without consent. While the friend's comment was public in the group chat, sharing it with his mother could lead to unintended consequences. However, the author is trying to address a serious issue of bullying or insensitive behavior. \n\nIn terms of morality, the line is thin. The author is not the one who made the harmful comment, so they're acting in defense of their girlfriend. But the method involves a form of retaliation that might not be legally or socially acceptable. \n\nI think the author's action is a reaction to protect their girlfriend and to address the friend's lack of remorse. The friend's comment was inexcusable, especially given the medical context. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to prevent further harm and correct the friend's behavior, but it's a gray area. The rightness or wrongness depends on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their group. Since the friend's actions were so harmful, the author's intent is protective, which might outweigh the breach of trust. So, answer B.\n"
