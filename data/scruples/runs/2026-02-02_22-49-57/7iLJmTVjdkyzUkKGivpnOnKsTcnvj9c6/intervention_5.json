All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a derogatory comment about their girlfriend who's undergoing chemo to his mom. \n\nFirst, the friend made a hurtful joke targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition, which is really sensitive. The author responded by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. They mention they don't want to escalate things in front of others and that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics here. The friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and cruel, especially given the girlfriend's medical situation. The author is upset and feels the need to confront this in a way that bypasses the friend's usual social circle, where he might get support or the issue minimized. \n\nBut is it okay to involve the friend's mom without giving him a chance to explain or apologize? Even if the comment was offensive, the author's action is a form of punishment without a prior discussion. The friend might have just made a careless joke, though it's still wrong. The author could have addressed it directly first. \n\nHowever, the friend showed no remorse and was dismissive (\"Don't talk shit then\"), which suggests he's not taking it seriously. The author might feel that this is a pattern of behavior, so involving the mom could be a way to make him understand the severity. \n\nThe dilemma is between righting a wrong (addressing the hurtful comment) and the method used (bypassing the person to their parent). In some cases, reporting to parents can be a valid approach if the person isn't responsive and the behavior is harmful. But it's also a breach of trust in the group chat context. \n\nThe author's intent was to hold their friend accountable for a cruel remark. The girlfriend's health is a significant factor here. The friend's comment could be seen as malicious, not just a joke. \n\nSo, considering the context and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author might have a legitimate grievance. But the action of sending the screenshot to the mom without a prior warning could be seen as harsh. But since the friend was unrepentant, maybe the author felt it was justified to involve his mom to prevent future harm. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the action was proportionate. If the comment was truly malicious and the friend is uncooperative, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the comment was a joke and the author didn't try to address it first, maybe they are. However, the friend's response indicates he's not taking it seriously, so the author might have no other choice. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here because the friend's behavior was harmful and they tried to address it but were ignored. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be a necessary step to stop further bullying. So the answer is B.\n"
