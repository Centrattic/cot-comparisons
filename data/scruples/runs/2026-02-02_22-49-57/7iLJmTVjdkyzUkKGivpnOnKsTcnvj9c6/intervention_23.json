All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author's friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through a very tough time with chemo, lupus, and kidney issues. The friend's comment was especially hurtful because the girlfriend is currently swollen and bloated due to her medical condition. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed their concerns. Now the author is considering sending the screenshot of the friend's offensive message to his mom to address the issue without escalating it in front of other friends.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether the author's actions are justified. Let's consider the key points. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a derogatory remark targeting someone in a vulnerable state. The author's girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, so the comment was particularly insensitive. The friend showed no remorse and even dismissed the author's concerns.\n\nNow, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. This could be seen as a way to involve an authority figure to address the friend's behavior, especially since the author's other friends haven't taken sides. However, sending private messages to someone's parent without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the content is offensive, the method of addressing it might be questionable. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was clearly in the wrong. Making fun of someone's medical condition is bullying and shows a lack of empathy. The author has a right to defend their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, escalating the conflict by involving the parents could have consequences. It might lead to the friend's parents being upset with the author, potentially causing more tension. Also, the author admitting that they've helped the friend hide things from his parents before adds another layer\u2014using the same method they've previously avoided might be hypocritical or seen as a betrayal.\n\nBut considering the context of the friend's repeated insensitivity and the lack of remorse, the author might feel that this is the only way to address the issue effectively. The author is trying to avoid public escalation but still wants to make sure the friend understands the seriousness of his actions. The friend's comment isn't just a joke; it's a targeted, cruel remark that could cause emotional harm. The author's action is a form of holding someone accountable, even if it's done in a way that might be seen as underhanded.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while the method might be questionable, the intention is to protect someone being targeted and to address harassment. However, there's a difference in whether the action is morally justified versus legally or socially appropriate. The author might not be in the wrong because the friend's behavior was egregiously offensive. Sending the screenshot could be seen as a necessary measure to prevent further harmful behavior, especially if the friend isn't receptive to direct confrontation.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of using the friend's own tactics (hiding things from parents) against him. The author mentions that they've helped the friend hide things from his parents, so using that same method might be considered hypocritical or a form of revenge. This could complicate the situation, as it turns into a tit-for-tat scenario rather than a straightforward moral issue.\n\nIn summary, the author is reacting to a friend's cruel and insensitive comment towards their girlfriend, who is already in a vulnerable state. While the method of addressing it (sending to the friend's mom) might not be the most ideal or socially acceptable approach, the underlying issue of the friend's harmful behavior is clearly on the friend. The author's actions are driven by the desire to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable, which could be seen as morally justified despite the questionable method. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
