All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through a serious health issue. The author confronted the friend, who didn't show remorse. Now the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the situation without escalating it publicly among friends.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend's comment was definitely inappropriate, especially targeting someone with a serious illness. The author tried to address it directly but didn't get a positive response. The author is now considering involving the friend's mom, which might be against the friend's wishes if they usually hide things from parents. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to defend their girlfriend and stand up against derogatory remarks. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent is to hold the friend accountable. The friend might have expected the conversation to stay within the group chat. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014the friend showed no remorse and the comment was particularly hurtful given the girlfriend's health issues\u2014the author's actions might be justified as a way to address the issue without public escalation. However, the act of sending a private message to the mom could be seen as a form of retaliation or invasion of privacy, depending on cultural and personal boundaries. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is protecting their partner and addressing a serious issue. In another, using the mom as a means to control the friend's behavior might not be the best approach, even if the friend is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action is seen as a necessary step to correct harmful behavior or as an overstep in private matters. Given the circumstances, the author's intention is to prevent further harm, which could be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But there's nuance here. However, the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the friend's comment was cruel and the author's action is a private response without public shaming, it's a tough call. But given the context, it's more about protecting someone from a harmful joke, so the answer might be B.\n"
