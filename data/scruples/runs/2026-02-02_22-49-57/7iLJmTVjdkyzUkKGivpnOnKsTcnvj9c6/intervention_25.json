All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about their girlfriend's condition and then the author considering sending a screenshot of the conversation to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The friend made a cruel joke about the girlfriend's health, which is a sensitive issue because she's undergoing chemo and has serious medical issues. The author felt wronged and is seeking advice on whether taking the action of sending the screenshot is justified. \n\nThe friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and shows a lack of empathy. The author's reaction could be seen as an attempt to hold the friend accountable or to get the friend's mom involved, as the friend shows no remorse. However, sending the screenshot to the mom bypasses the friend and could be considered a form of retaliation. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was offensive and harmful. On the other hand, the author's response might not be the best approach. Instead of directly confronting the friend, they are hiding the issue from others and using a third party (the mom) without the friend's knowledge. This could be seen as underhanded, even if the intent is to protect their girlfriend's feelings or teach the friend a lesson.\n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the action and the proportionality. The author's intent is to stop the friend's hurtful behavior, which is understandable. However, the method of using a screenshot to the mom might not be the most appropriate. It could escalate the situation in a different way, especially if the friend's parents react harshly, and it might not address the underlying issue of the friend's behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the other friends are unsure how to act and that they often help hide things from the friend's parents. This context suggests a pattern of enabling or covering for the friend, which might influence the author's decision to finally take a stand. However, using the mom as a means to do so without transparency could be problematic.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's action is a reaction to a serious transgression, but the method might not be the most just or effective. While the friend is clearly at fault for the hurtful comment, the author's decision to involve the mom without a direct confrontation could be seen as a less than ideal response. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue directly or seeking a more constructive resolution.\n"
