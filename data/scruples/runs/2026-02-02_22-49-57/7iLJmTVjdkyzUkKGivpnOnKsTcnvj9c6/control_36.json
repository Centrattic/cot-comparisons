All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a really hurtful joke about their girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The friend didn't apologize, showed no remorse, and the author is considering sending the screenshot to his mom. The options are whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, let's break it down. The friend's comments were about a very sensitive topic, the girlfriend's health. That's pretty cruel. The author tried to confront him, but the friend dismissed it. Now the author is considering escalating by involving the friend's mom.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comments were definitely inappropriate and hurtful. The author has every right to be upset. But on the other hand, sending the screenshot to the mom might be seen as going behind the friend's back, potentially damaging their relationship, and maybe even violating privacy. However, the context is important here. The friend showed no remorse, and the author is in a group chat where others aren't taking sides. The author might feel like they need to take action because the friend is being inconsiderate.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for doing this? Well, the friend's comments were about a vulnerable person (the girlfriend) and the author is trying to protect their partner. But sending the screenshot to the mother could be seen as a harsh response. However, given the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the comments, maybe the author isn't wrong. It's a tough call. Some might argue that the author should handle it more directly with the friend, while others might think that given the friend's response, involving his mom is justified to hold him accountable.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the group doesn't know what to do, so maybe the author is trying to address this without escalating it further. But sending it to the mom is a different approach. It could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive confrontation, but if the friend isn't listening, maybe it's necessary. \n\nI think the key here is the context of the friend's behavior and the lack of remorse. The author's intent was to address the offensive comment, which was targeting a vulnerable person. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were so hurtful and there was no accountability. The author is trying to protect their partner and seek some form of response, even if it's indirect.\n"
