All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who has lupus and is undergoing chemo, leading to her being swollen and bloat. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive issue given her medical condition. The friend showed no remorse, just told the author not to talk shit. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, possibly as a way to address the friend's behavior without escalating things in front of other friends. The friends are in a group chat and usually help hide things from parents, but the author is conflicted about the morality of this action.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Was the friend's comment appropriate? Definitely not. Mocking someone's health issues, especially when they're vulnerable, is cruel. The author's girlfriend is dealing with a serious illness, so the friend's joke is not just a joke but harmful. The friend's lack of remorse is concerning. \n\nThe author's response is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. This action could be seen as a form of confronting the friend through the parents, perhaps to make the friend face the consequences. However, sending private messages to someone's parent without permission can be considered a breach of privacy and might escalate the conflict in an unintended way. The author is trying to avoid escalating things in front of friends but is considering using the parent as a mediator. \n\nBut here's the catch: By sending the screenshot to the mom, the author is exposing the friend's behavior to someone else without his consent. While the friend's comment was inappropriate, the author's method of addressing it might be problematic. The author is using a tactic (involving the friend's mom) that the friend and others might see as underhanded, especially since they usually hide things from parents. The author is also considering revealing something personal about the friend (his real dad leaving him), which could be a further escalation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The friend's comment was definitely wrong, but the author's response is a form of revenge or confrontation through a third party. While the intention is to address the friend's harmful behavior, the method might not be the most appropriate. The author could have chosen to address it directly with the friend, seek support from other friends, or involve a trusted adult without going to the friend's mom in a secretive way. The action could be seen as crossing a line into retaliation, especially if it's done without the friend's knowledge and possibly leading to a strained relationship or unintended consequences for the friend.\n\nHowever, considering the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, some might argue that the author is justified in trying to make the friend face the repercussions. But the method of doing so (without consent and in a group that usually hides things from parents) complicates it. So, the answer might be a nuanced \"A\" because the author's action is a form of retaliation and breaches privacy, even if the original comment was wrong.\n"
