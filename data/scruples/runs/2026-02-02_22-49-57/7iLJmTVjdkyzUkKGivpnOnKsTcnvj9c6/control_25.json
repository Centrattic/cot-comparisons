All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The friend's comment was insensitive and crossed a line. The author confronted him, but the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's action is justified. The friend's comment was about a vulnerable topic\u2014his girlfriend's illness. Using someone's health issues as a target for jokes is deeply disrespectful. The friend showed no remorse, which adds to the severity. The author is trying to address the situation, maybe to get the friend to face consequences, especially since the group hasn't taken sides yet.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a breach of privacy or a form of retaliation. The author is using the friend's family to pressure him, which might not be the best approach. But considering the friend's insensitivity and the potential harm of his words, the author's intent might be to protect his girlfriend's dignity and seek accountability.\n\nThe key points are the friend's malicious intent and the author's motivation to address a harmful joke. While the method might be questionable, the underlying issue is serious. The question is whether the means justify the end. In some cases, escalating to a parent might be necessary if the person isn't taking responsibility. However, it's a judgment call between respecting privacy and addressing harm.\n\nIn summary, the friend's actions were clearly in the wrong. The author's action is a response to that. While it's not the most conventional approach, the severity of the joke about a health issue could justify the author's decision, especially if he believes it's the only way to make the friend understand the seriousness. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
