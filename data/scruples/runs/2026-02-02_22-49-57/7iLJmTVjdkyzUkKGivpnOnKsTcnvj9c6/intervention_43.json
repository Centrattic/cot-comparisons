All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong when they sent a screenshot of their friend making a joke about their girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend said something offensive in a group chat, targeting the girlfriend's medical condition. The author responded with a body-shaming comment, and the friend escalated with a cruel remark about the girlfriend's size. The author then sent the screenshot to the friend's mom to get the parents involved. \n\nThe main question is about whether this action was wrong. The author is trying to hold their friend accountable for making a hurtful joke, especially since the girlfriend is dealing with a serious illness and resulting physical changes. The friend showed no remorse, so the author might feel that other means of confrontation (like talking to him) have failed. \n\nOn one hand, sharing a private conversation with a parent could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the friend made a harmful comment. The group chat was private, and the author is using that against their friend by involving his mom. This could be considered sneaky or not using open communication, which might be seen as wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the joke was about a very sensitive topic. The girlfriend's health issue is grave, and making a joke that targets her condition is cruel and inconsiderate. If the friend is unapologetic and the author feels other friends aren't taking a stand, the author might be trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. In that case, the action could be justified as a way to address the serious harm caused.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. The friend's comment was definitely wrong, but retaliating by sending a screenshot to his mom might be crossing a line. However, given the context of the girlfriend's medical struggles, the severity of the joke, and the friend's lack of remorse, maybe the author's intent is to stop further harm. \n\nCultural factors might play a role here. In some contexts, involving parents is a common way to address issues, especially if the person is a minor (the author is 18, so the friend is likely around the same age). But if the friend is an adult, it's more about privacy and trust. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that other friends are not taking sides, which could mean they're in a situation where they need to act unilaterally. The alternative to sending the screenshot might have been confronting the friend in front of others, but the author chose to involve the parents instead. \n\nI think the key here is the intent and the context. The friend's actions were hurtful and targeted a vulnerable situation. The author's action is a response to that, but it's a private matter being exposed. The question is whether the wrongness of the friend's comment justifies the author's action. \n\nIf the author had first tried to address the issue directly and failed, maybe sending the message to the parents is a form of seeking help. But if they skipped the direct confrontation and went straight to involving parents, that could be seen as overstepping. However, the friend's comment was so severe that it might be considered a form of bullying or harassment, which sometimes warrants external intervention. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action might be seen as justified in protecting their girlfriend from further harm, especially if there's a pattern of cruel behavior and no willingness to change from the friend. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's also the aspect of privacy and trust in the group chat dynamics. However, the severity of the joke about a medical condition could tip the balance towards the author being in the right.\n"
