All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The girlfriend has serious health issues, and the joke was not just about weight but also involved a personal and sensitive situation. The author tried to address it directly but the friend dismissed it. Now the author is considering escalating by sending the evidence to the friend's mom.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the joke and the intent behind sharing it. The joke targeted someone who is already vulnerable due to her health. The friend showed no remorse, which adds to the severity. The author's motivation is to hold the friend accountable, especially since others in the group are hesitant to act.\n\nMoral considerations: Is it right to involve parents? Normally, airing someone's private messages without consent can be seen as violating privacy. However, in this case, the comment was harmful and the friend is unrepentant. The author might feel that this is a necessary action to protect their girlfriend's dignity and to confront the friend about the inappropriate behavior.\n\nLegal aspects: If the screenshot is shared without consent, it could be an invasion of privacy. But since it's a group chat and others were part of the conversation, there's a gray area. The friend's comment itself could be considered harassment or bullying, which might justify the action if the author is seeking to address it.\n\nSocial dynamics: The group is complicit in hiding things from the friend's parents, but this situation might be different because of the severity of the comment. The author is trying to prevent future harm by showing the parent the evidence.\n\nSo, considering the context of a serious health issue, the lack of remorse from the friend, and the potential to prevent further harm, the author's action could be seen as justified. The main issue is whether the ends justify the means. Since the comment was a direct attack on a vulnerable person, the author's intent to correct the behavior might outweigh the privacy violation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
