All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering escalating the situation by sharing the screenshot with the friend's mom to get him in trouble.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friend's comment was not only hurtful but also targeted someone who's already dealing with serious health problems. The author's girlfriend's condition is a significant factor here. The friend's lack of apology and the author feeling they can't confront him effectively in front of others adds to the tension.\n\nIs the author's action justified? Well, using a screenshot to report the behavior to a parent is a form of escalation. It's not a direct confrontation, which the author tried and failed. The friends in the group chat didn't take a side, so the author is seeking another way to hold the friend accountable. The user's options are to either let it go or take this step. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend from further hurt and possibly teach the friend a lesson.\n\nHowever, there's a moral aspect. The author is using a privacy violation by sharing the screenshot, which could be seen as crossing a line. But the context of the offensive comment's severity might mitigate that. The question is whether the ends justify the means here. The friend's behavior was extremely insensitive, and the author is left with limited options since direct confrontation didn't work and others are neutral.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's initial comment is clearly wrong, but the author's response is a form of retaliation. However, given the circumstances and the friend's lack of remorse, the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to address the harm done. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), but I need to ensure there's no aspect I'm missing. The key points are the severity of the joke, the health context, and the lack of other effective recourse.\n"
