All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, which is extremely sensitive. The girlfriend's health issues are severe, and the comment was not just a joke but a hurtful remark. The friend didn't apologize and showed no remorse.\n\nThe author then considered sending a screenshot of that message to the friend's mom. The question is whether that action makes the author wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The friend's lack of remorse is a problem. The author felt justified in wanting to expose the friend's behavior, perhaps to get a parent involved to address the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without considering the consequences could be seen as a breach of privacy or an escalation. However, given the context of the friend's behavior, the author's action might be seen as a necessary step to address the harassment, especially if other avenues (like confronting the friend directly or involving other friends) haven't worked. \n\nThe key points here are the severity of the friend's comments, the lack of remorse, and the potential for the mother to intervene. The author might be trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. While the method is questionable, the intent is to address a serious issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. However, considering the friend's actions were harmful and the author's intent was to address this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But then again, involving parents without a clear understanding of the dynamics might have unintended consequences. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the author's action might be justified as a form of self-defense or protecting their partner, even if the method isn't perfect. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
