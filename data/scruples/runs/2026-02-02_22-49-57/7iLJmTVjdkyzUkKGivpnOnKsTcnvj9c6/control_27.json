All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author tried to respond, but the friend escalated it with a comment targeting the girlfriend's weight and health. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, which is a form of retaliation. \n\nNow, analyzing the ethics here. The friend's comments are clearly inappropriate and show a lack of empathy towards someone who's seriously ill. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so this joke is not just a joke but harmful. The author is upset and wants to confront the friend, but instead of doing it directly, they're thinking of involving the friend's mother, possibly to teach him a lesson.\n\nThe key points are: the friend's offensive behavior, the author's intent to retaliate by sharing the screenshot with the parent, and the dynamics of the group chat where others haven't taken a side yet. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for this action? Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without his consent might be a breach of privacy. However, the context is that the friend has shown no remorse and the comments were hurtful. The author is using a method that others might consider underhanded, especially if the group often hides things from parents. But the friend's behavior was inexcusable. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to defend their girlfriend and address the hurtful comments. On the other hand, involving the parent via a screenshot without a direct conversation might not be the best approach. It could be seen as escalation rather than resolution. However, given the friend's lack of remorse, maybe the author feels this is necessary to make him understand the impact of his words.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The friend's comments were clearly wrong, but the author's response might be considered a form of revenge. However, considering the severity of the initial offense, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to hold the friend accountable for his harmful words. The moral dilemma here is between privacy and accountability. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised to address issues directly before involving others. But if that's not possible or effective, then involving a parent might be justified, especially if the person is a minor (the author is 18, so the friend might be around the same age). However, since the friend has no remorse, the author's action might be seen as a necessary step to correct his behavior, even if it's not the most direct method. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because they're responding to a harmful comment and trying to make the friend understand the consequences, even if the method isn't perfect. Alternatively, it could be A if the method of sharing without direct confrontation is considered wrong. But given the context, the friend's behavior was worse, so the author's action is a reaction to that, which might not make them wrong.\n"
