All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author confronted the friend, but the friend dismissed it, showing no remorse. The author then considers sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to escalate the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the joke about her weight is not just a joke but a personal attack. The friend's response to \"Don't talk shit then\" suggests he doesn't see his actions as offensive, which is problematic.\n\nNow, the author's action is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether that makes them wrong. On one hand, the friend's comment was inexcusable, and the author has a right to be upset. The author might feel that confronting the friend directly didn't work, so they're taking another route. But on the other hand, escalating the issue by involving the friend's mother could be seen as a betrayal or a power move, even if the friend was in the wrong. \n\nThe group chat context is also important. The other friends didn't take a side, and the author might be trying to avoid public escalation. However, sending the screenshot to the mom is a form of behind-the-scenes escalation. The author might think it's justified because the friend has no remorse and the comment was about someone in such a vulnerable condition. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are the severity of the friend's comment and the author's intent. The friend's statement was cruel and insensitive, which is a serious issue. The author's action, while unconventional, was in response to a provocation. However, using screenshots and involving parents might not be the most constructive way to handle it, but given the context, the author's intent was to address a hurtful joke. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the friend's actions are clearly in the wrong. The author's response is a reaction to that. While the method of escalation (sending to mom) might be debatable, the underlying issue is the friend's cruelty. So, the author's actions are a response to being wronged. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
