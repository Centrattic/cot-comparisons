All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo, to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a hurtful joke targeting the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with a serious illness. The author tried to respond in a joking manner but the friend escalated it by making an offensive comment. The author then considers escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's comment is not just a joke but a direct attack on someone who is already vulnerable. The author is defending their partner and trying to hold the friend accountable. The friend shows no remorse and even dismisses the author's concerns. The author is considering using a tactic they've used before (hiding things from parents) but feels this is different because of the serious nature of the comment.\n\nThe author's actions are a form of retaliation, which is a gray area. But given the context\u2014protecting a loved one who is in a critical health situation\u2014there's a strong argument that the author is trying to seek justice or at least make the friend face consequences. The friend's behavior is inexcusable, and the author might feel that public shaming through the parent is necessary since other avenues (friends not taking sides) aren't working.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as violating privacy or involving parents unnecessarily. But given the severity of the friend's words, some might argue it's justified to hold the friend accountable, especially if he's showing no remorse. The author isn't just being petty; they're standing up for someone being targeted unfairly.\n\nOn the other hand, escalating to a parent might be considered crossing a line, depending on the relationship and the usual group dynamics. But considering the context of the friend's cruel comment and the lack of remorse, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary response to prevent further harm and ensure the friend understands the seriousness of his words.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's intent is protective and corrective, not malicious. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here.\n"
