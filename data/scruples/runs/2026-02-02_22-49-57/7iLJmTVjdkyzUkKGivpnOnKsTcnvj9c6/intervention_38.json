All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about someone named \"friend\" making a really hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author then considers sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend's weight and health conditions, which is definitely insensitive and wrong. The author was trying to respond in a teasing way but then the friend escalated it. The author is upset and wants to take action.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. On one hand, the friend's comment was mean and hurtful. On the other hand, the author's response is to involve the friend's mother, which could be seen as a form of retaliation or escalation. \n\nI should think about intent and proportionality. The author's intention is to hold the friend accountable for his hurtful words, especially since the friend showed no remorse. However, using a screenshot to the friend's mother might be seen as a harsh response, but given the context of the girlfriend's serious health issues, it could be justified as a way to highlight the severity of the friend's comment. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they don't want to escalate things in front of other friends, so privately sending the screenshot to the mom might be their way of addressing it without further conflict. The friends are unsure how to act, so maybe the author is trying to take matters into their own hands. \n\nBut there's another angle: is this the right approach? Maybe the author should have talked to the friend directly again or involved an adult authority figure. However, the question isn't about whether the action is advisable but whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the friend's comment was offensive and the author is trying to get a response to stop the bullying, the author's action might be justified. The key here is that the friend's comment targeted someone with a serious illness, which is not acceptable. The author's reaction, while not the most conventional, is in response to a direct attack on their partner. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're responding to a harmful and hurtful comment made by the friend, especially when the friend showed no remorse. The action taken is a form of seeking justice or accountability, even if it's not the most diplomatic approach.\n"
