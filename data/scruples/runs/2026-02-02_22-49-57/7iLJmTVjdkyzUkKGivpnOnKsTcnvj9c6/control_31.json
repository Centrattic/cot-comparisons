All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend made a really hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has a serious medical condition. The friend said something about her being fat because of her swelling, which is due to her illness. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the friend's actions. Making a comment that targets someone's appearance based on a medical condition that's beyond their control is clearly inappropriate. The friend's remark was not only cruel but also shows a lack of empathy and understanding. The author's girlfriend is dealing with a life-threatening illness, and mocking her for that is really insensitive.\n\nNow, looking at the author's response. The author confronted the friend directly in the group chat, which makes sense because they were in a group setting. But the friend didn't take it seriously and even doubled down with an \"I don't care\" attitude. The author is frustrated and considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether this action is justified or if the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address the friend's inappropriate behavior. The friend's comment was a direct attack on the girlfriend's health, which is a sensitive and personal topic. The author might feel that their friend is not taking the issue seriously, so escalating to involve the parent could be a way to make them understand the gravity of their words. However, sharing a screenshot could be seen as a form of retaliation or revenge, especially if the author isn't giving the friend a chance to apologize or correct their behavior first. \n\nBut considering the context, the friend has shown no remorse, and the comment was particularly cruel given the girlfriend's health situation. The author's actions could be seen as a necessary step to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend has a history of making such jokes. The author is also concerned about not escalating things in front of other friends, who might not know how to handle the situation. Sending the screenshot to the mom could serve as a way to bring the parent into the equation, possibly leading to a more serious consequence for the friend, which the author might feel is warranted given the lack of apology.\n\nHowever, the author is bypassing the friend's accountability process by involving the parent directly without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. In some contexts, this might be seen as an overreaction. But given the severity of the comment and the friend's dismissive attitude, it could be justified as a last resort to address the situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's comment was cruel and targeted a medical condition, the author tried to address it directly but the friend refused to take it seriously, and the author is considering involving the parent as a response. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this action.\n\nIn terms of right versus wrong, it's about proportionality and the intent. The author's intent is to stop the friend from making such hurtful comments again, especially since the friend has shown no remorse. The method of sending a screenshot to the mom could be seen as a way to enforce accountability, even if it's not the most conventional approach. However, it's also possible that the author could have handled it differently, like involving a mutual friend as a mediator or giving the friend more time to reflect. But given the context, it's hard to say if the author is wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the friend's actions were clearly wrong, and the author is reacting to that. The author's actions, while perhaps not the most ideal method, are a response to a serious offense. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
