All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to that friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has a serious medical condition. The friend's comment was not only mean but directly targeted a vulnerable aspect of the author's girlfriend. The author felt that the friend had no remorse and was being disrespectful.\n\nThe author considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the situation without escalating it in front of their other friends. They also mention that the friends don't know how to handle it and haven't taken sides yet. The user is asking if the author is wrong for considering this action.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the elements. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author tried to address it directly but the friend dismissed their concerns. The author is now considering involving the friend's parent as a way to hold them accountable. \n\nOn one hand, sending the screenshot to the parent might be seen as a private form of accountability, especially if the friend isn't taking the issue seriously. It could be a way to let the parent know about the behavior without public shaming in the group chat. On the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle it through direct confrontation or involve other friends first. However, given the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse, the author might feel that this step is necessary to prevent further harm. \n\nThe key points are the context of the friend's comment being cruel and insensitive, the author's attempt to address it, and the lack of support from other friends. The action of sending the screenshot is a form of seeking intervention from an authority figure (the parent), which can be justified in this scenario. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to address a harmful action by someone who shows no remorse.\n"
