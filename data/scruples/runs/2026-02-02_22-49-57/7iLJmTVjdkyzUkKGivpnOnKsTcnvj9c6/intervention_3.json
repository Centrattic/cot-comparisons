All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive message to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. \n\nFirst, the friend made a derogatory comment targeting the girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive issue given her medical condition. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend dismissed it and showed no remorse. The author is considering escalating by involving the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, sharing the message with the friend's mom might be a way to hold the friend accountable, especially if the original group chat didn't address it. However, doing so without the friend's consent could be considered an invasion of privacy. The friend's comment was indeed inappropriate, especially considering the girlfriend's health struggles.\n\nThe author might feel justified because the friend's words were hurtful and showed a lack of empathy. But using the mom as a medium to escalate could lead to unintended consequences, like family tensions. However, given the context of the group chat being a space where they help the kid hide things from parents, the author might feel that this is a necessary action to get the friend to realize the severity of his actions.\n\nBalancing both sides, the friend's comment was clearly in the wrong. The author's action, while not the most conventional, might be seen as a way to confront the issue when direct methods failed. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's a nuance here.\n"
