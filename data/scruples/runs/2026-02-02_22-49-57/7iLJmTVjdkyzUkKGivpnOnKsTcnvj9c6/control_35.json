All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend made a really hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The friend said something about her weight and made a joke that's really insensitive. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that message to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's actions. The friend made a comment that's clearly targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. Since the girlfriend is dealing with serious medical issues, this joke is not just a joke\u2014it's cruel and shows a lack of empathy. The friend didn't apologize and seemed to have no remorse, which adds to the problem.\n\nNow, the author is thinking about taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mom. The possible consequences here are that the friend's mom might be upset, and it could lead to conflict. But the author is trying to hold the friend accountable for his hurtful words. The author is also in a group chat where others aren't taking sides, so he's feeling isolated.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to take this action? Well, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate. The author's intention is to address the friend's behavior, which is justified. However, sending it to the friend's mom without discussing it directly first could be seen as escalation. But given that the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author is looking for another way to make him understand the seriousness of his words.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect his girlfriend and stand up for her. On the other hand, confronting the friend's mom might not be the best approach. But considering the context\u2014health issues, lack of apology\u2014it's a tough situation. The author isn't the one making the hurtful comments; he's reacting to them. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The real issue is the friend's behavior. The author is looking for a way to handle a friend who's being inconsiderate, and while the method might be questionable, the motivation isn't.\n"
