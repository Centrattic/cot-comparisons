All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author considers sending a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend said something offensive about the author's girlfriend, referencing her health struggles. The author is frustrated because the friend isn't showing remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation, possibly to get the friend in trouble.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend made a cruel joke, which is definitely wrong. The author's reaction is to expose the friend by sharing the message with his mom. Is this justified?\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was about a very sensitive topic\u2014health issues that are serious. Making fun of someone's medical condition is clearly inappropriate. The author is defending their partner, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is planning to take the conversation to the friend's mom without giving the friend a chance to address it directly. This could be seen as an escalation. However, the author mentions that they tried to address it directly but the friend was unapologetic. The friends in the group chat aren't taking sides, which might mean the author feels unsupported.\n\nNow, considering the potential consequences. By sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, the author could cause a bigger conflict. But given the friend's lack of remorse and the seriousness of the joke, the author might feel it's necessary to hold the friend accountable. The friend's comment wasn't just a joke; it was targeting someone's vulnerable health situation, which crosses a line.\n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (author isn't wrong). The main factors are intent and proportionality. The author's intent is to confront the friend's inappropriate behavior. The method is sharing the evidence with the friend's parent. While it's an escalation, the original comment was severe. If the friend is unapologetic and the author feels that the friend needs to face consequences, then the author's action might be justified as a form of accountability.\n\nHowever, there's a difference between accountability and revenge. If the author is doing this to get back at the friend for other reasons (like the friend's biological dad), that complicates things. The scenario mentions that the author might also bring up the friend's personal issues, which could be a motive for revenge beyond the initial incident.\n\nSo, if the author is using this as an opportunity to retaliate and not just to address the specific comment, then it's wrong. But if it's solely to report the friend's harmful comment to his mom because he's unrepentant and the situation is serious, then it's a justified action to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable.\n\nThe user's situation is a bit ambiguous in terms of the author's motives. The key is whether the author is acting out of a desire to address the specific harmful comment or to escalate the conflict for other reasons. The original act by the friend was definitely wrong, and the author's action, while harsh, might be seen as a response to protect their partner and teach the friend a lesson, especially if the friend is unapologetic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the line is blurry. But considering the context of the friend's comment and his lack of remorse, the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to prevent future harm. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (author isn't wrong). But if the author is using this as a personal vendetta, then A. However, the scenario doesn't clearly indicate personal vendetta beyond the immediate incident. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
