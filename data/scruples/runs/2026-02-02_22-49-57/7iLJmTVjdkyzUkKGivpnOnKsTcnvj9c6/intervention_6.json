All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. The situation is that the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has a serious medical condition. The friend not only insulted the girlfriend's appearance but also showed no remorse when confronted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was particularly cruel given the girlfriend's health issues. The author felt that the friend crossed a line, and the friend's response was dismissive. The author then decides to send the screenshot to the friend's mom, possibly to get the parents involved or to teach a lesson.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate and hurtful. The author's girlfriend is vulnerable because of her medical condition, so making a joke about her weight and appearance is especially insensitive. The friend's lack of remorse might have led the author to feel that other methods of addressing the issue (like talking to friends or confronting the friend again) weren't effective. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable, especially if the parent is someone who can address the issue with authority.\n\nOn the other hand, sending a screenshot without the friend's consent might invade his privacy. The author is bypassing direct communication and going to the parent, which could be seen as escalating the situation. However, given the severity of the comment and the friend's dismissive attitude, the author might feel that this is a necessary step to prevent further harm. Also, the group chat context suggests that the comment was made in a public space where others might have seen it, so sharing the screenshot to their parent isn't necessarily creating a new issue but exposing existing harmful behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the action. If the author's goal is to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's harmful behavior, then the action might be justified. However, if the author's motive is revenge or to embarrass the friend, that could be problematic. The scenario mentions the author is considering not escalating in front of other friends, which suggests they want to avoid public confrontation but still address the issue. The mention of revealing the friend's personal information (real dad leaving him) if the screenshot isn't sent indicates a possible desire for retaliation, which complicates the moral aspect.\n\nIn terms of social norms and ethics, there's a debate about privacy versus accountability. While privacy is important, when someone's actions are harmful and they refuse to take responsibility, others might feel justified in exposing that behavior to protect the victim and deter future harm. The key here is the severity of the original offense and the lack of remorse from the friend.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the context of the friend's cruel and insensitive comment, the girlfriend's vulnerable health situation, and the friend's dismissive response, the author's action of sending the screenshot to the parent might be seen as a justified attempt to address the issue, especially if other avenues weren't effective. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
