All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to screenshot their friend's offensive comment to his mom is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's dealing with serious health issues. The friend not only called the girlfriend a \"bitch\" but also made a comment about her weight, which is related to her medical condition. The author confronted him, but the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of this exchange to the friend's mom.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's comment was hurtful and insensitive, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable without escalating things publicly. The friend has a history of making inappropriate jokes, and the author feels cornered because the friend's response was dismissive.\n\nNow, considering ethics. The friend's behavior was clearly wrong and harmful. The author is trying to address this by bringing it to the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of accountability. However, sending a private message to a parent without the other person's consent could be seen as violating privacy. But given the context of the friend's cruel joke and the lack of remorse, the author might feel justified in this action to prevent future harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like talking directly to the friend more assertively or involving a mutual friend. But the author mentions that others in the group didn't take sides, so maybe they feel they can't rely on social support. The friend's comment was a direct attack on the girlfriend's health, which is a serious matter.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking this action. The friend's actions were inexcusable, so the author's response could be seen as a justified attempt to hold the friend accountable. However, sending a screenshot to the parent is a personal choice that might have consequences, like damaging the friendship or causing family issues. But given the context, the author's intention is to address a harmful joke, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's comment was the real issue, and the author is trying to address it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
