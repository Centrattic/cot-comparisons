All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemo and has significant health issues. The friend's response was cruel, using her medical condition (which makes her swollen and bloated) in a sexualized and offensive way. The author confronted the friend, but the friend dismissed it, showing no remorse. \n\nThe author is considering sending a screenshot of this exchange to the friend's mom. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nKey factors here: The friend's comment was clearly inconsiderate and cruel, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author's reaction is in response to this, and they feel the friend has no remorse. The group chat usually has a culture of hiding things from parents, so this action might be against that norm, but the author is trying to address a serious issue. \n\nIs the author justified in this action? Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a private intervention. It's not a public shaming, just informing the parent about the inappropriate behavior. Considering the context of the friend's comment, which is hurtful and shows a lack of empathy, the author might feel this is necessary to hold the friend accountable. \n\nHowever, there's a line between defending a loved one and escalating the situation. The author is choosing to involve the parent, which could be seen as a mature approach to address the friend's behavior. Since the friend has no remorse and the group is not taking sides, the author might feel this is the only way to make an impact. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like confronting the friend more effectively or seeking support from others. But given the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse, the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to address the issue when other methods failed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The action, while possibly unconventional, is in response to a cruel and hurtful comment, and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's behavior appropriately.\n"
