All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a guy in a group chat with friends discussing lacrosse. His friend makes a joke about his girlfriend's condition. The girlfriend has lupus, kidney issues, and is undergoing chemo, which makes her bloated and swollen. The friend calls her a \"400-pound fatass,\" which is really cruel because it's related to her medical condition.\n\nThe author responds by saying the friend went too far, but the friend dismisses it. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment is clearly inappropriate. Making fun of someone's health issues, especially when they're already vulnerable, is not okay. The author's girlfriend is going through a tough time, and the friend's joke is both hurtful and shows a lack of empathy. \n\nNow, the author is thinking of escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom. He mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents. This suggests that the group is used to keeping the friend's behavior secret. But in this case, the friend's comment is about someone else's health, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe author's intention here is to confront the friend's behavior in a way that might make him realize the severity of his comment. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the group usually supports the friend. On the other hand, if the friend is showing no remorse, maybe the author is justified in taking this step to protect his girlfriend and hold the friend accountable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment was the initial wrongdoing. The author is reacting to protect his girlfriend and address the friend's toxic behavior. While sending the screenshot might not be the most diplomatic approach, the context of the friend's callousness and the author's intent to prevent further harm could mean the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the action of sending the screenshot without the friend's consent does involve a privacy breach. \n\nBut considering the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, the author's actions might be more about justice than malice. The key here is whether the author's action is proportionate. The friend's comment was a direct attack on someone's health, which is a serious matter. So, while the method might be questionable, the intent is to address a serious issue. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
