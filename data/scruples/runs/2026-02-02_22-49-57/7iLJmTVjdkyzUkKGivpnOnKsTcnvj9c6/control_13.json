All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemo and has a medical condition causing swelling. The author then responds with a joke about the friend's appearance, which leads to the friend making a comment about the girlfriend's weight, referencing her medical issues. The author then considers sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment is clearly insensitive and cruel, targeting someone who is already vulnerable due to her health. The author's initial response was a bit teasing as well, but the friend escalated things by making a personal attack. The author is upset and feeling that the friend has no remorse. Now, the author is considering taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mom as a way to address the situation without escalating it further in front of others.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The friend's comment was malicious and targeted a vulnerable person. 2) The author is seeking a way to hold the friend accountable without direct confrontation. 3) The potential action (sending a screenshot to the mom) is seen by the author as a necessary step, though they acknowledge it might be \"shitty.\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment was clearly the wrong action. The author's response to the initial joke was playful, but when the friend crossed the line, the author felt justified in taking action. However, sending the screenshot to the mom could have consequences. On one hand, it might be seen as a justified intervention to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's behavior. On the other hand, it could be viewed as a breach of trust or privacy, depending on the relationship dynamics. But considering the context\u2014especially the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the comment\u2014the author's action might be seen as a way to make the friend responsible for his actions. The author isn't retaliating with personal information about the friend's family (as hinted in the last sentence), but instead using the friend's own words against him to involve a parent, which is a common way to address inappropriate behavior in teens. \n\nIn many cases, involving parents isn't the ideal solution, but given the friend's dismissive attitude and the severity of the comment, the author might not have other avenues to address this. The friends in the group are not taking sides, so the author is left with limited options. The author's intention is to prevent further harm to their girlfriend and to make the friend understand the seriousness of his words. Therefore, the author is acting out of concern and a desire to protect their partner, which is a valid motivation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The friend's actions were the problem, and the author is taking a step to address the situation responsibly, even if it's not the most conventional method. The answer should be B.\n"
