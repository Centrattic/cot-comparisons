All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about their girlfriend's health condition, and the author considering taking a screenshot of that comment and sending it to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend said something cruel about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author felt that the comment was inappropriate and confrontational, especially since the girlfriend's health is very sensitive. The friend not only made the comment but also showed no remorse, which is a big red flag. \n\nThe author is considering sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. \n\nIn terms of moral and ethical considerations, the friend's behavior was clearly inconsiderate and hurtful. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially when it's a severe one like chemo and lupus, is not just rude but can be considered bullying or harassment. The fact that the friend dismissed the author's concern by saying \"Don't talk shit then\" shows a lack of empathy and accountability.\n\nHowever, the author's response of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of retaliation. While the friend's actions were wrong, the author's method of addressing it might be crossing a line. Telling someone's parent about their behavior without their knowledge could be seen as violating privacy, even if the intent is to confront the issue. It's a form of escalation that might not be constructive. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the friend's ongoing behavior. Since the friend has shown no remorse and the group of friends often covers for him, the author might feel that this is a necessary step to address the problem. In a situation where the person is repeatedly hurtful and the immediate peers aren't taking action, the author might perceive this as a justified measure to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable.\n\nOn the other hand, using a screenshot as evidence without giving the friend a chance to apologize or address it privately might not be the most effective approach. However, given the friend's dismissive attitude, the author might not see a better option. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are a response to a serious issue. While the method is questionable, the underlying problem\u2014the friend's cruel comments\u2014is clearly on the friend. The author's intention is to address this wrongdoing, which is not inherently wrong. However, the method of confronting it might be problematic because it involves involving a parent without prior dialogue. \n\nBut considering the context, where the friend has already crossed boundaries and the author feels that their friends aren't supporting them, the author's actions might be seen as a last resort. In this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially if they're trying to prevent further harm. The key point is that while the friend's behavior is clearly wrong, the author's method of response is debatable but might be justified given the circumstances.\n"
