All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is that the author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend's comments were insensitive and targeted the girlfriend's appearance due to her medical condition. The author then sent a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly out of line. The girlfriend's health is extremely fragile, and making a joke about her weight and appearance during such a vulnerable time is hurtful and lacks empathy. The friend showed no remorse when confronted, just brushing it off with \"Don't talk shit then.\" That's a red flag for disrespect and potential bullying.\n\nNow, the author's action was to forward the screenshot to the friend's mom. Is this justified? On one hand, it's a private message, and sharing it without consent could be seen as invading privacy. But the context here is a severe case of bullying or harassment, especially targeting someone with a serious illness. The friend's behavior was not just a joke but a personal attack that the author felt compelled to address. The author felt that confronting him directly wasn't effective, so he took this step to involve a parent, possibly to get the friend to understand the seriousness of his actions.\n\nIn terms of morality and social norms, there's a balance between privacy and harm. If the friend's actions were genuinely harmful and the author believes that the friend won't change, then involving a parent might be a necessary step to protect his girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. The author isn't just seeking revenge but trying to prevent further harm by making the friend and his mom aware of the inappropriateness of his behavior.\n\nHowever, there's a risk in escalating the situation. The group chat friends are caught in the middle, and the author might be overstepping by taking it to the parent. But given the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse, it could be seen as a justified action to protect his girlfriend and address the unacceptable behavior.\n\nSo, weighing the harm done by the friend's comment against the potential harm of the author's action, the former is more severe. The friend's comment caused emotional distress and targeted someone vulnerable, while the author's action is a form of confrontation to stop further harm. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for taking this step to address the serious issue.\n"
