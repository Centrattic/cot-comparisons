All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of that friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a joke targeting the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her medical condition. The author is upset because the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of revenge or confrontation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the worst for doing that. On one hand, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, especially given the context of the girlfriend's health issues. The author might feel justified in wanting to protect their partner and hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, the author is planning to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mom, which could lead to more conflict. Also, the friend might have crossed a line, but the author's response could be seen as retaliatory rather than addressing the issue directly with the friend.\n\nI should consider the moral implications. Reporting the friend to his mom might be a way to address the behavior, but it's also bypassing direct communication. The author's friends are present but not taking sides, so maybe the author feels they can't rely on them. However, sharing the screenshot with the mom could damage the relationship between the author and the friend, and perhaps the author's own reputation. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe confronting the friend directly, seeking support from others, or ignoring it. The author might feel that the friend's lack of remorse makes direct confrontation ineffective, hence the screenshot idea. But the action of sending it to the mom is a judgment call. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend's initial comment is clearly wrong. The author's response is an attempt to address the wrong, but the method (screenshot to mom) is questionable. The author might not be in the wrong because they are reacting to a hurtful comment, but the method could be seen as unethical or unnecessary. However, sometimes people take actions they later regret when angry. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author is upset and trying to protect their partner, which is understandable. But sending the screenshot might be an overreaction. It's a matter of perspective. If the answer options are A or B, I need to decide if the author's action makes them in the wrong. Maybe the answer is B (No), because the author is responding to a prior wrong, but it's still a judgment call. Alternatively, some might say A because the author is escalating the situation. I think the key is that the friend was in the wrong initially, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to address it, even if their method is questionable.\n"
