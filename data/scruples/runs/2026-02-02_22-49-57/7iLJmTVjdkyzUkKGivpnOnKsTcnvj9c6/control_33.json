All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about sending a screenshot of a friend making a hurtful comment about their girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo, to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a joke that was clearly inappropriate and cruel, referencing the girlfriend's medical condition. The author felt that the friend crossed a line, and the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to confront him, which is a common method in these types of questions.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's comment was offensive, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author's response is to involve the friend's parent, which can be seen as a form of escalated retaliation. But is this justified?\n\nIn terms of moral or social wrong, when someone makes a cruel joke about a friend's partner's health, it's generally considered in poor taste and harmful. The author's action of sending the screenshot to the mom is a way to hold the friend accountable, but it's also a breach of privacy and could be seen as a betrayal. However, given the severity of the comment, some might argue the author was within their rights to take such action to protect their girlfriend's feelings and address the friend's insensitivity.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend's comment was indeed malicious and the author is trying to correct their behavior, maybe not. However, the act of sending the screenshot to the mom without the friend's consent could be seen as a violation of trust, especially if it's done without giving the friend a chance to apologize or make things right. The group chat context also matters\u2014others in the chat might be complicit in hiding things from the friend's parents, which adds another layer.\n\nOn one hand, the author's girlfriend is vulnerable due to her health, and the friend's comment is cruel. On the other hand, using a parent as a means to confront the friend might not be the best approach, but the author might feel it's necessary. The answer might hinge on whether the action is considered a justified response to a hurtful comment or an overstep.\n\nIn similar scenarios, people often debate the ethics of exposing someone in this way. If the friend had no remorse and the author felt they couldn't address it directly through friends, sending it to a parent might be seen as a last resort. However, it's a private matter, and the author's action could damage relationships. But given the context, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
