All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend made a really offensive comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo, resulting in her being swollen and bloated. The friend said something like \"fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend,\" which is clearly targeting the girlfriend's condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment is extremely insensitive and cruel, especially given the girlfriend's medical situation. Making a joke about someone's appearance that's directly related to their illness is not just mean, it's potentially harmful. The author is clearly upset because their friend has no remorse. \n\nNow, the author's response is to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. On one hand, this could be seen as a form of revenge or escalation. But on the other hand, the friend's comment was directed at the girlfriend's health condition, which is a serious matter. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility, so they're trying to involve the friend's parent to make them aware of the situation.\n\nIs the author wrong in taking this action? Well, it's a judgment call. The friend's comment was clearly wrong, and the author is trying to hold them accountable. However, involving the friend's mom might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author is bypassing the friend to escalate the issue. But given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, it could be argued that the author is trying to address a serious issue that the friend isn't taking seriously.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has made other jokes in the past, and the group often helps him hide things. This might indicate a pattern of behavior where the friend isn't being held accountable, so the author's action could be a response to that. \n\nHowever, there's a line between holding someone accountable and taking matters into their own hands. The author didn't confront the friend directly in front of others, which might have been a better approach, but instead is considering involving the friend's parent. That could be seen as crossing a line, but given the severity of the offense, it's a close call.\n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the author is justified in wanting to address the friend's harmful comment, especially since it's related to a serious health issue. The friend's comment was intentionally hurtful and targeted a vulnerable person. The author's intention, as stated, is not to escalate but to address the lack of remorse. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The friend made a terrible comment, and the author is trying to address it in a way that the friend isn't responding to. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
