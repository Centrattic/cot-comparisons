All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's actions. The friend made a joke that was not only disrespectful but also hit close to home by targeting the girlfriend's medical condition. That's pretty serious. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend showed no remorse. \n\nNow, the author is considering escalating the situation by sharing the message with the friend's mom. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might argue that it's invading privacy or causing unnecessary conflict. However, the friend's comment was hurtful and showed a lack of empathy, which might justify the author's actions as a form of accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of respecting boundaries and privacy. Sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a breach of trust among friends. But given the severity of the joke and the girlfriend's health situation, the author's intention is to protect their partner and teach the friend a lesson.\n\nWeighing both sides, the friend's behavior was inexcusable. The author's response, while potentially confrontational, is a reaction to a serious insult. I think the author is not in the wrong here because they're standing up for their girlfriend and addressing harmful behavior.\n"
