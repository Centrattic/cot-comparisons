All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inconsiderate, especially given the girlfriend's health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the friend's actions were inappropriate. The friend made a joke about someone's appearance due to medical conditions, which is definitely crossing a line. The author felt wronged and was upset. Now, the author's response was to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. \n\nIs this justified? Well, the author is trying to address the friend's behavior without escalating it directly in front of others. They mention that the friend shows no remorse and that the group usually helps him hide things. The author might be trying to get the parents involved as a form of accountability. However, involving parents by leaking a private conversation could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the friend was in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to be upset and wanted to hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, sending the screenshot without the friend's consent to his mom might be considered a violation of privacy. It's a moral dilemma. The friend's comment was wrong, but the author's method of addressing it could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nI think the key points are the intent and the proportionality. The author's intent was to stop further hurtful behavior, but the method involved deceit and sharing private messages. Whether that's in the wrong depends on cultural or personal ethics. Some might argue that the friend's actions were so egregious that any response is justified. Others might say that the author should handle it through direct confrontation or other means first. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action is a gray area. They were responding to a hurtful joke, but the method used could be seen as unethical. However, given the friend's lack of remorse and the potential for ongoing issues, the author might feel this was necessary. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to address a serious issue, even if the method is questionable. But I can see arguments for A as well.\n"
