All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author tried to respond but the friend escalated it with a comment about the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her medical condition. The friend showed no remorse. The author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom as a way to address the situation without escalating it in front of others.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Nature of the Friend's Comments**: The friend made a derogatory and hurtful comment targeting someone's serious medical condition. That's clearly wrong and cruel. The friend's lack of remorse is also a problem.\n\n2. **Author's Response**: The author first confronted the friend directly but got no valid response. Then, considering the friend's behavior and the group's inaction, the author is thinking of involving the friend's mom. The question is whether this action crosses a line.\n\n3. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: While the friend's actions were inexcusable, the author is considering a form of retaliation by exposing the friend's behavior to his mother. This could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy, even if the motive is to address a serious issue. However, the context is that the friend has been making harmful comments, and the author is trying to address it without a public confrontation.\n\n4. **Intentions and Proportionality**: The author's intent is to hold the friend accountable for his hurtful remarks. However, sending the screenshot to the mother without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a constructive resolution. It might also lead to unintended consequences, like the mother being upset or the friend facing repercussions he might not deserve if there's no prior context.\n\n5. **Alternatives Considered**: The author mentions that friends are not taking sides. They might not have considered other options like involving a teacher or counselor, or perhaps having a more direct conversation. But given the friend's lack of remorse, maybe those options aren't viable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the friend is in the wrong for making the cruel comment, the author's action of sending the screenshot could be seen as crossing a line. However, the context of the friend's behavior and the severity of the comments might mitigate the wrongness of the author's action. It's a tough call because both sides have valid points. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and address a serious issue, but the method chosen might not be the best approach. \n\nBut according to the question, the options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). Considering that the author is reacting to a serious and hurtful comment, and the friend showed no remorse, the action might be justified as a form of accountability. However, using the mother as a middleman without the friend's knowledge might not be the right approach. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend's actions were so egregious, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But in terms of right vs. wrong, the author's action is a breach of privacy and trust, which is generally considered wrong, even if the motive is good. So perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit confused here because the friend's actions were so hurtful. Maybe the answer is B (No), because the author is trying to address a serious issue the friend caused. Hmm. \n\nWait, but in most ethical frameworks, even if the motive is good, the action of betraying someone's privacy without their consent is usually considered wrong. Unless it's to prevent harm. But in this case, the harm was already done, and the author is trying to address it. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural or situational norms. Since the scenario is presented as a \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...), the community usually considers both sides. The key here is that the friend's comment was extremely cruel and targeted someone's health condition. The author's action is a form of standing up for their girlfriend. However, using the mother as a go-between could be seen as crossing a line. But if the author's alternatives are worse (like saying something about the friend's real dad), then maybe it's a lesser evil. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer could be B (No), because the friend's actions were so wrong that the author's response is a justified attempt to hold them accountable, even if the method is questionable. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the answer might be A, as the author is still violating the friend's privacy. But given the context of the friend's behavior, perhaps the answer is B. I think I'll go with B.\n"
