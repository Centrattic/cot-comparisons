All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend making a cruel joke about his girlfriend's health to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a really hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who is going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author tried to respond in the group chat, but the friend didn't take responsibility. Now the author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. So, the key points here are the context of the offensive comment and the author's response. The friend's joke was targeting the girlfriend's health, which is a sensitive and severe issue. The author's girlfriend is dealing with a life-threatening condition, so the comment was not just mean but also potentially triggering or harmful.\n\nNow, the author's action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of confronting the friend's behavior without directly escalating it in front of peers. The friends in the group chat aren't taking sides, which might mean they aren't aware of the context or the severity. By going to the friend's mom, the author is trying to hold the friend accountable for his words, which were not just rude but also showed a lack of empathy towards a vulnerable person.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the friend's parent without giving the friend another chance to apologize. But given that the friend dismissed the author's initial confrontation and showed no remorse, the author might feel that this step is necessary. The comment was a direct attack on the girlfriend's health, which is a serious matter, and the friend's refusal to acknowledge the harm makes the author's action more defensible.\n\nIn terms of morality, while it's true that involving parents isn't always the best approach, the context here is about protecting a loved one who is already in a fragile health state. The author might be trying to prevent further harm and possibly change the friend's behavior. The fact that the friend made a joke about something so serious indicates a lack of respect and consideration, which the author is trying to address.\n\nSo, considering the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, the author's action might be seen as justified in protecting their girlfriend and ensuring the friend understands the inappropriateness of his words. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
