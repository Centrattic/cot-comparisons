All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is 18 years old and in a group chat with friends discussing lacrosse. A friend makes a comment that's pretty offensive towards his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend uses a derogatory term and makes a joke about her weight, which is related to her medical condition. The author confronts him, but the friend doesn't care. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of that friend's message to his mom. The friends are hesitant, and the author is conflicted but feels justified because the friend has no remorse.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether sending the screenshot is the wrong thing to do. The key points here are the severity of the friend's comment, the context of the girlfriend's health, and the potential consequences of exposing the friend's message.\n\nThe friend's comment is clearly offensive and targets someone's health condition. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so making fun of her weight when it's a result of medical issues is insensitive and harmful. The friend shows no remorse, which adds to the frustration.\n\nNow, the author's response is to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. This is a form of sharing private information without consent, which is known as doxxing or outing someone. It's a privacy violation and can lead to embarrassment for the friend. But the author's motivation is to address the friend's inappropriate behavior and protect their girlfriend.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between defending someone's dignity and using a tactic that could be seen as retaliatory. The author might be trying to hold the friend accountable, but the method could be considered in the wrong because it's an invasion of privacy and might not be the most constructive approach. The friends are also unsure, indicating that the situation isn't clear-cut.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the friend's comments are definitely in the wrong, the author's action of exposing the message could be seen as a breach of trust and potentially escalates the conflict. The author might have other options, like confronting the friend directly or seeking mediation, rather than involving parents. But given the friend's lack of remorse, maybe the author feels there's no other option left.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the friend's behavior is abhorrent, sending the screenshot could cause harm to the friend's personal life and relationships. The author might be acting out of anger and a desire for justice, but the action itself is ethically questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action is not morally justified. They are in the wrong for violating the friend's privacy, even if the friend's actions were offensive. The correct approach would be to address the behavior through other means, like direct confrontation or involving a trusted authority without exposing the friend publicly.\n"
