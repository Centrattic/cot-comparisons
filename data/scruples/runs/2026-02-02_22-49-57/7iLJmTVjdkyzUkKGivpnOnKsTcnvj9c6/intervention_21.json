All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend made a really hurtful comment in a group chat about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend called the girlfriend a \"400 pound fatass\" when she's actually swollen from medical issues, not just being overweight. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and cruel, targeting someone with health issues. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the friend showed no remorse. The author is upset and feels that their friend is being disrespectful.\n\nNow, the question is whether sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is justified. On one hand, the author is trying to address a hurtful comment made by the friend. On the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's parents could lead to more conflict. The author mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents, so this might be a way to teach him a lesson or make him understand the seriousness of his words.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for doing this? Well, the friend's comment was clearly mean and targeted someone in a sensitive situation. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and respond to the friend's lack of empathy. However, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom without considering the consequences could be seen as a breach of trust or an overreaction. It might also expose the author to potential backlash or make things worse between them and the friend.\n\nBut given the context of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, maybe the author has a valid reason to take this step. They might feel that their other friends aren't taking a side, and this is a way to make the friend understand the impact of his words. The author isn't trying to cause trouble but to address a serious issue.\n\nI think in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions were clearly problematic, and the author is trying to hold him accountable in a way that he might understand. While it's not the most diplomatic approach, the intent is to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's behavior, which was inexcusable.\n"
