Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her making fun of his sport, trampolining. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author has been dedicated to trampolining for 12 years, reaching national and international levels. He was training intensely, even getting funding. He had to quit due to a head injury. They met after he stopped competing. She knows about his sport and initially thought it was cool. When discussing sports, she makes a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, comparing it to soccer, implying it's easier. He breaks up with her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over that, but he feels it's about his identity and dedication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sport is a significant part of his identity. He invested a lot of time and effort, and it's a source of pride. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive and belittling, not just about the sport but about his achievements. She's suggesting that his success in a less popular sport isn't as valid as someone's in a more mainstream sport like soccer. That's a pretty harsh thing to say, especially given how much it meant to him.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the depth of his feelings about the sport. She played volleyball, which she mentions, but maybe she was trying to make a joke or downplay his comment. However, the way she phrased it (\"you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport\") sounds condescending. The author felt attacked, which is valid because his identity and hard work are tied to the sport.\n\nBreaking up over this might seem extreme to some, but if the comment struck a nerve related to his self-worth, it's understandable. The key here is whether the girlfriend's comment was a legitimate concern or a trivial issue. Since she dismissed his passion and achievements, which are central to his identity, the reaction could be justified. The friends' opinions that he's an asshole might be based on the idea that it's too harsh, but they might not understand the emotional impact of the comment.\n\nAnother angle: communication. If there was a misunderstanding, maybe they should have discussed it. But the author might have felt that the comment was a deal-breaker because it undermined a core part of who he is. It's possible that the girlfriend never intended to hurt him, but the statement itself is disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require respect for each other's passions and achievements. If one partner mocks or belittles the other's significant life experiences, that's a red flag. The author's reaction is a consequence of feeling disrespected. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
