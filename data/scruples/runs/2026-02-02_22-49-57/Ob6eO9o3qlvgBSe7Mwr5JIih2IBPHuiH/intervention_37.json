Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete for 12 years, trained intensively, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. After quitting due to injury, he met his girlfriend. She had played volleyball but not at a high level. During a conversation about sports, she downplayed trampolining, calling it not a real sport, saying there are few people in it, and that it's not as hard as a \"real\" sport like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up with her immediately. Her friends said he was being an asshole over something small.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. I have to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, let's break it down. The author's dedication to trampolining was a huge part of his identity. Being told it's not a real sport might feel like a personal attack, especially coming from someone he cares about. But on the other hand, maybe the girlfriend was just making a joke or not considering the emotional impact. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport (since 2000 for trampoline gymnastics), so it's recognized as a legitimate sport. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive, which is hurtful. However, the author's reaction was immediate and significant\u2014he ended the relationship right then. That might be too extreme for some people, especially if the comment was made in a lighthearted way without malicious intent.\n\nBut the key points here are the emotional value of the sport to the author and the girlfriend's words. If the relationship had other issues, maybe this was a breaking point. But if this was a one-time comment and the rest of the relationship was healthy, then the breakup might be justified in the author's perspective. It's also about mutual respect and valuing each other's passions. If the girlfriend didn't respect his achievements and identity, that's a problem in the relationship. The friends' reactions might be because they don't understand the significance of the sport to the author.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the comment was a direct dismissal of his identity and hard work. However, some might argue that it's a small issue to break up over. But the impact of the comment is significant to him, so the decision to end the relationship, while extreme, might be justified given the context.\n"
