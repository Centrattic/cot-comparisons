Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to a high-level sport, which is a significant commitment. Trampolining being considered a \"real sport\" might be a point of contention. The girlfriend compared it to soccer, implying that trampolining isn't as legitimate. \n\nThe key here is whether the comment was a legitimate criticism or a hurtful dismissal. The girlfriend's statement could be seen as minimizing his effort and achievements. The author felt attacked because his identity and hard work were tied to his sport. However, breaking up over a single comment might be seen as overreacting, even if the comment was hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require mutual respect. If she dismissed his passion, that's a red flag. But the author's response\u2014immediate breakup\u2014might come off as extreme. Friends' reactions suggest the breakup was over a minor issue, which complicates things. \n\nIt's possible the author is justified if the comment hit a sensitive nerve about his self-worth. However, the decision to break up immediately without addressing the issue might be seen as hasty. The question is whether the response was proportionate. \n\nIn some cases, values like respect for each other's passions are crucial. If the girlfriend didn't respect his dedication, maybe the breakup was necessary. But the abruptness without discussion could be a problem. However, the author might have felt that the comment revealed a deeper disrespect that he couldn't overlook. \n\nConsidering all angles, there's a balance between standing up for one's self and overreacting. The answer hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate disrespect or a trivial misunderstanding. Since the girlfriend made a generalization about the sport's legitimacy, which the author took personally, it's a clash of values. The author might be in the right to leave if he felt disrespected, but some might argue the breakup was too harsh. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful to his passion, which he valued highly. Disrespecting someone's achievements can be a deal-breaker, especially if it's tied to their identity. However, others might argue that a single comment isn't enough. But given the emotional impact and the importance of mutual respect, the author's reaction is understandable.\n"
