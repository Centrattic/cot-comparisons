Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level national athlete in trampolining, training 30 hours a week while in high school, and even got funding. He quit due to a head injury. The girlfriend was okay with his sport before, and he thought her volleyball background was cool. Then during a conversation, she downplays his achievements, saying trampolining isn't a real sport, that it's not hard to reach a high level, and that if he had played a real sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. The author dumps her immediately, and her friends and others think he's being too harsh. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the girlfriend's comment was a valid reason for breaking up. The author's reaction is based on the fact that his identity and self-worth are tied to his sport. She's not just making a joke but actually belittling the effort and skill involved. The question is if her statement was a deal-breaker or if the author overreacted.\n\nI should consider the context of their relationship. They met after he stopped competing, so maybe she didn't fully appreciate the depth of his commitment. Her comment could be seen as dismissive of his hard work and accomplishments. Even if she didn't mean to be harsh, saying something like \"it's not a real sport\" can be hurtful, especially when it's a core part of someone's identity. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author took it as an attack on who he is is important. Relationships often involve respecting each other's past and achievements. If her friends and others think he's being too harsh, that might indicate some bias towards certain sports, but in the context of the relationship, respect is key. \n\nThe girlfriend might not have realized the significance of her words, but the author felt disrespected and devalued. Deciding whether the breakup was justified depends on how serious the disrespect was and the overall dynamics of their relationship. Since the sport was a huge part of his life and he was successful in it, her statement could be seen as invalidating his efforts. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was inconsiderate or not. The author's action was extreme, but if the comment hit a nerve that's central to his identity, it might not be without reason. However, some might argue that one comment isn't a valid reason to end a relationship. But the author's reaction could be seen as standing up for his self-worth. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because his reaction was based on feeling devalued in a core aspect of his identity. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, and the author had the right to end the relationship if he felt it couldn't be reconciled.\n"
