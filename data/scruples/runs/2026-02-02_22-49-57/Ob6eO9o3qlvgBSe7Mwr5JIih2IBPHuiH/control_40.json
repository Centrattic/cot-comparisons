Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was a high-level trampolinist, training extensively and competing nationally and internationally. He quit due to a head injury. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She knew about his sport and always thought it was cool. She mentioned she wished she had played volleyball more. He responded that being a top athlete is great. Then she said trampolining isn't a real sport, noting it's not hard to reach high levels compared to something like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his dedication and identity, so he broke up with her. Her friends and others think he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. The author is now asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The sport in question is trampolining. Is trampolining considered a \"real\" sport? Trampolining is recognized by the International Gymnastics Federation and is an Olympic sport since 1992 for men and women. So objectively, it's a legitimate sport. However, perceptions can vary. Some people might not take it as seriously as others, perhaps because it's not as widely known or popular as sports like soccer. The girlfriend's comment might stem from a lack of awareness or understanding of the sport's rigor and competition level.\n\nThe author's reaction is intense\u2014immediately breaking up over her comment. He felt that she was attacking who he is, given his lifelong dedication. His history of training for 30 hours a week, being nationally and internationally competitive, and receiving funding all show a significant commitment. For him, the sport is a core part of his identity. Her dismissive comment could have felt like a personal attack on his achievements and identity.\n\nBut is her comment justified? She said trampolining isn't hard to reach high levels compared to soccer. This might be a misunderstanding. Trampolining requires a lot of skill, precision, and physical fitness. The author's own accomplishments (top 500 worldwide, national competitions) show it's not easy. However, the perception that it's less mainstream or less accessible than soccer could influence her viewpoint. She might not realize the dedication required, even if she thought his sport was cool.\n\nThe question is whether the breakup was justified. Breaking up over a single comment, even if it's a sensitive topic, can seem extreme. However, if the comment struck a nerve because it invalidated a significant part of his identity, maybe his reaction is understandable. But relationships require communication and understanding. If the girlfriend made a comment that clearly hurt him, she might have been inconsiderate. However, his immediate decision to break up without addressing or discussing the issue might indicate that he's using this as a reason to end the relationship for other underlying problems.\n\nAlso, her friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. This suggests that others see the issue as minor. The woman might not have intended to hurt him, but the author took it as a personal attack. The key here is whether the reaction was proportionate. The author's deep emotional investment in the sport makes the comment more hurtful, but breaking up on the spot without discussion could be seen as overreacting.\n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might have some responsibility. The girlfriend made a dismissive comment without understanding the significance of the sport to him. The author reacted extremely by breaking up immediately, which could be seen as disproportionate. However, if the comment was a culmination of other issues, perhaps it was a breaking point. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the breakup was solely based on this comment, then maybe he is. But if there were other underlying tensions, it's possible. The information given doesn't mention other issues, though.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's reaction might be seen as an overreaction, especially if there was no prior discussion or if this was an isolated incident. However, if the girlfriend's comment was a reflection of a deeper disrespect or other issues, it might be justified. But based solely on the provided scenario, the author's immediate breakup seems harsh, especially when others view it as a minor issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not giving the situation a chance to be resolved through communication.\n"
