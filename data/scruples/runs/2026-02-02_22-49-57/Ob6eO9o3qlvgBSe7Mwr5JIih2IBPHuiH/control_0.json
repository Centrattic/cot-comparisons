Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy spent 12 years training in trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, got funding, and had a significant career. After he quit due to an injury, he met his girlfriend. She initially seemed to think his sport was cool, but during a conversation about sports, she downplayed trampolining as not a \"real\" sport and implied that if he had played a real sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. He took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her on the spot. His friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but he feels it's about respecting his dedication.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's comment about trampolining not being a real sport, the guy's emotional reaction leading to a breakup, and the friends' opinions. \n\nI need to consider if the guy's reaction was justified. She made a dismissive comment about his sport, which was a major part of his identity. He felt attacked, which led to the breakup. Some might say that breaking up over a single comment is extreme, especially if it's not the first time she's been disrespectful. Others might argue that if something is that important to your identity, it's valid to end a relationship over disrespect towards it.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comment itself: calling trampolining not a real sport could be seen as invalidating his hard work and achievements. Even if she's not an expert, making such a statement might come off as condescending. However, maybe she didn't mean it as a personal attack but was just expressing her opinion. The guy took it as a personal attack because of its significance to him.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did he address his feelings about the sport before, or was this the first time she said something? If she had a history of dismissing his passions, it might be more justified. But if it was a one-time comment, maybe the breakup was too harsh. However, the fact that it's a core part of his identity and she made a belittling remark could make his reaction understandable.\n\nAlso, the friends might see it as a small thing because they might not realize how much the sport meant to him. But he's the one who felt that his dedication and identity were being attacked. So, the question is whether respecting someone's dedication to their passion is a valid reason to break up over a comment that undermines it.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted in a way that's proportionate and if there's a history of issues. In this case, if this was an isolated incident, some might think the breakup was too quick. However, if the sport is that central to his identity and the comment was a direct attack, others might support his decision.\n\nI think the answer could go either way, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the comment was a significant personal attack on his identity and dedication, which is a valid reason to end a relationship if it's a deal-breaker. However, others might argue that taking it that seriously is excessive. But given the context of his investment in the sport, maybe B is the right choice.\n"
