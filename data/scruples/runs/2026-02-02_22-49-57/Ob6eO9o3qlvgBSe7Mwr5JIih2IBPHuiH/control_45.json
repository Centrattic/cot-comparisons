Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author dedicated 12 years to trampolining as a high-level athlete, representing Canada, and then after quitting due to injury, his girlfriend dismissed his sport as not being a real sport. He broke up with her because he felt she was attacking his identity. Now, the question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective is that his sport is valid and meaningful. He put in a lot of time and effort, and the criticism hurt because it undermined his dedication. Trampolining is an Olympic sport now, so it's recognized, but maybe not as mainstream as soccer. His reaction was immediate\u2014he dumped her on the spot. That's pretty drastic. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the depth of his commitment. She played volleyball in high school, which is different but still a sport. Her comment could have been a joke or a misunderstanding. She might have been trying to compare sports, not devalue his experience. People often say things without realizing the impact, especially in disagreements. \n\nNow, considering whether breaking up is a reasonable response. It's a major decision. Dismissing someone's passion and hard work can be hurtful, especially if it's a core part of their identity. However, the author's reaction seems extreme. Maybe he should have addressed the comment calmly first, discussed how it made him feel, and given her a chance to explain or apologize. Instead, he cut things off immediately. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends think he's in the wrong for overreacting. That might indicate that his response isn't seen as proportionate by others. While the comment was disrespectful, breaking up immediately could be seen as a lack of communication and problem-solving. Relationships require effort and understanding both sides. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's statement could be a reflection of societal biases against less mainstream sports. People often undervalue niche sports, not realizing the dedication required. The author's reaction shows how personal and significant his sport is to him. But the way he handled it might have been too harsh. \n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was hurtful and disrespectful, the author's immediate decision to break up without any prior discussion or opportunity for her to address the comment might be seen as the wrong move. The issue is about how he handled the conflict, not just the validity of his feelings. So, he might be at fault for not addressing the issue more constructively.\n"
