Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The man dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, got funding, and had significant achievements. His girlfriend made comments implying that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easier than other sports like soccer. He took it very seriously, leading to an immediate breakup. His friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the value of dedication and the validity of the sport. The woman's comments seem dismissive of his hard work and achievements. For someone who has invested so much time and effort, being told that their sport isn't real can feel like a personal attack. It's not just about the sport itself but about respect for the effort and identity tied to it.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the breakup was over a single conversation and that the woman's comments, while hurtful, might not warrant ending a relationship. However, given the emotional weight this sport holds for him, and the dismissive nature of her remarks, it's possible that this was a deal-breaker for him. He might have felt his identity was being attacked, which is a significant issue in a relationship.\n\nThe friends' reaction is also interesting. They said he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but maybe they don't understand the depth of his feelings towards the sport. It's possible that the woman's comments were a culmination of previous issues or a trigger for deeper insecurities about his sport's recognition.\n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's passions and achievements is crucial. If one partner feels their core identity is being disrespected, it can lead to a breakdown in trust and respect. The woman's comments might have been seen as invalidating his entire journey, which is a serious issue.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider if he gave her a chance to explain her comments. Did he confront her about her views on sports before reacting? Breaking up immediately might have been an overreaction if there was potential for discussion and understanding. But given that he felt attacked and the sport is such a big part of who he is, maybe his reaction is justified.\n\nThe key here is whether the woman's comments were a legitimate critique of the sport or a personal attack on him. If she was making a general remark about trampolining's status, it's one thing, but if she was mocking his dedication, that's another. His reaction seems to stem from feeling that his identity and hard work were undervalued, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is complex, the man's decision might be understandable if the comments deeply hurt him and he felt his identity was attacked. However, others might see it as a hasty decision. But given the context of his lifelong dedication and the personal nature of the attack, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
