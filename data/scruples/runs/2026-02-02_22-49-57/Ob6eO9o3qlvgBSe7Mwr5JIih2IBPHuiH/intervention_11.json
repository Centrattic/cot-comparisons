Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she made fun of their sport, trampolining. The key points here are the dedication to the sport, the girlfriend's comments, and the reaction.\n\nFirst, the author dedicated 12 years, intense training, and even got national recognition. That's a huge commitment. The girlfriend dismissed trampolining as not a \"real\" sport, comparing it to something more popular like soccer. That's a classic case of undervaluing someone's passion. The author felt it was an attack on their identity because the sport was so integral to their life. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends said the author was an asshole for breaking up over \"something small,\" but the author sees it as a major issue. The problem here is about respect. When someone makes a comment that undermines a significant part of another person's identity, it can be a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's friends might not see the value in the sport, but the author clearly does. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a comment can seem harsh, but if that comment struck a nerve and showed a lack of respect, maybe it's justified. However, maybe the author could have addressed it without breaking up immediately. But given the emotional impact, it's hard to say. The question is about whether the author acted wrong. The girlfriend's remarks were disrespectful to his dedication and identity, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
