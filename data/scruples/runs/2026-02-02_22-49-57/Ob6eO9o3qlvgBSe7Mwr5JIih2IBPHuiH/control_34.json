Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. They need to answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I should understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 12 years and significant time. After an injury, he quit. He and his girlfriend met after he stopped. She initially thought his sport was cool. When they discussed sports, she said trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than others like soccer, and that it's not hard to get to a high level. The author took this as a personal attack and dumped her immediately. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. The girlfriend's comments were clearly dismissive of his dedication. She minimized his achievements by saying it's an easy sport and not a real one. The author felt attacked because trampolining is a big part of his identity. \n\nBut I need to consider if breaking up over this is justified. Relationships require mutual respect. If she belittled something he's passionate about, that's a problem. However, the timing matters. Did this conversation happen once, and was it a deal-breaker? Also, maybe she didn't realize how much it hurt him. But she made a judgment about his sport, which is part of his self-worth.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that taking a single comment as a reason to break up is too extreme. But if the comment is about a core part of his identity, it's understandable. The friends might not see the depth of his feelings. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the judgment is often about whether the action was overly harsh. Here, the author walked away immediately, which some might see as impulsive. However, if the comment was a trigger for long-standing insecurities or if the girlfriend had a history of devaluing his interests, it's more understandable. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's a real sport. Her statement shows a lack of understanding and respect for his dedication. The author's reaction, while sudden, is about defending his self-worth. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend's friends are right, and he's overreacting. However, given the context of her comparing it to a popular sport and undermining his effort, it's a valid reason for him to feel disrespected. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), because the author's reaction is a matter of personal boundaries and respect for his identity. The girlfriend's comments were disrespectful, and he felt it was important to his self-respect.\n"
