Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been dedicated for 12 years, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. When they were talking about sports, she said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than real sports like soccer. He took it really personally and dumped her on the spot. Her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: his sport is a major part of his life, he's achieved a lot, and her comment felt like an attack on his identity and dedication. That's valid. People can take comments about their passions really personally, especially if it's a core part of who they are. The emotional response makes sense here.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized how sensitive he is about trampolining. She might have made a joke or a casual comment without intending to hurt him. But then again, saying something isn't a real sport and comparing it to soccer could be seen as dismissive. Her friends called it \"something small,\" but maybe they don't understand the depth of his feelings towards the sport.\n\nWas the breakup justified? Breaking up over a single comment seems extreme to some. However, if this was a recurring issue or showed a deeper disrespect for his values, maybe. But the context here is a one-time conversation. The guy might have felt that she didn't respect his dedication, which is a big deal. But maybe he should have addressed it without breaking up immediately. \n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole. The community often looks at these cases and considers intent and context. If she was being dismissive and he felt it was a betrayal of his identity, it's a tough call. However, walking out without giving her a chance to explain or apologize could come off as rash. But if her comment was the last straw after previous tensions, maybe not. The story doesn't mention prior issues, so it's assumed it's just this one incident. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, people are advised not to take things too personally and to communicate. But here, the core identity was attacked, which can be hurtful. So, is he wrong? Maybe not. But some might argue that he overreacted. The friends said he's an asshole, but they might not see the emotional impact. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The girl's comment was disrespectful, but the immediate breakup without discussion is extreme. However, the guy has every right to feel disrespected. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but maybe she's not entirely at fault either. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the comment was a direct attack on his identity and dedication, and he acted on his feelings, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But others might see it as A (he's wrong for breaking up over a joke). \n\nBut considering the depth of his commitment and the emotional impact, the community might side with B. So, answer B.\n"
