Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again and think it through step by step.\n\nThe author has been dedicated to trampolining for 12 years, training a lot, competing nationally and internationally for Canada. They even got funding. Then they had a head injury and had to quit. They met their girlfriend after that, and she always thought their sport was cool. But in a conversation about sports, she downplayed trampolining, saying it's not a real sport and implying that if he had played a \"real\" sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. The author took this as an attack on their identity and effort, so they dumped her. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's at stake here. The author's dedication to their sport is a big part of their identity. The girlfriend made a dismissive comment about trampolining, which the author found hurtful. The key points are the girlfriend's statement and the author's reaction.\n\nIs trampolining a \"real sport\"? Well, it is an Olympic sport, so technically it's recognized. But some people might not take it as seriously as others, especially if they're used to more popular sports like soccer. The girlfriend might have been trying to compare the author's achievements in trampolining to her own (volleyball) but made a derogatory remark about his sport. That's problematic because it's not about his dedication but the sport's perception.\n\nThe author's reaction: dumping her immediately. That's a big move. People might say that breaking up over a single comment is harsh, but if that comment touched a nerve that's been sensitive for a long time (like the author's lifelong dedication and identity tied to the sport), maybe it's justified. The author mentions that this sentiment (undermining trampolining) was something they've dealt with their whole life, so it's a recurring issue for them.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends say the author is an asshole for overreacting. But maybe they don't understand the depth of the author's feelings. The author's sport has been a central part of their life, and the girlfriend's comment dismissed that. It's not just about the sport but about the effort and identity the author invested in it.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended a major attack. Maybe she was just making a casual, ignorant remark. But the author's reaction is about their personal values and how they're respected in the relationship. If someone's core identity is being devalued, that can be a dealbreaker. The author might have felt that without respect for their past, the relationship wasn't sustainable.\n\nSo the question is: was the author right to dump her over this? If the comment was a significant disrespect for something the author deeply values, then the reaction could be seen as appropriate. People should be able to express their passions without being mocked. The girlfriend's comparison to soccer and the implication that the sport is less valid might have crossed a line. The author's decision to end the relationship when their identity was attacked could be justified, especially if they felt it was a dealbreaker. However, some might argue that a single comment shouldn't end a relationship, but if it's part of a pattern or hits a sensitive spot, then it's more about the cumulative effect. The author says it was on the spot because of this comment, which suggests it was the final straw. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful and undermined a significant part of the author's life. The author's dedication and achievements should be respected, and if the girlfriend can't do that, it's a valid reason to break up. So the answer would be B.\n"
