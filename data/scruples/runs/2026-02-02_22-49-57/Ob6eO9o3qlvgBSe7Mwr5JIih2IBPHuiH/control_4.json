Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining an \"unreal\" sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained extensively, and had funding. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive of his dedication. The author felt attacked and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The girlfriend's statement that trampolining isn't a real sport is subjective. Different people have different opinions on what constitutes a real sport. However, the author's reaction was to dump her right away. The friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are the validity of the girlfriend's comment versus the author's response. While the comment was hurtful, is breaking up the appropriate response? Relationships require communication and understanding. Dismissing the relationship entirely for a one-time comment might be too harsh. However, if this was a deal-breaker for the author, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. \n\nBut the author's dedication to the sport is a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend's comment might have been a trigger for deeper issues. However, ending the relationship immediately without discussion could be seen as impulsive. The friends' reactions suggest that others think it's too small a reason to break up. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt that his identity was being attacked, it's a personal response. However, the rightness here is about whether the action was justified. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt his values were deeply violated, but others might see it as an overreaction. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The girlfriend's intent wasn't necessarily to end the relationship, but her comment was disrespectful. The author's response was extreme. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because breaking up over a single, albeit hurtful, comment without dialogue is disproportionate. But there's also nuance. The answer depends on whether the comment was a symptom of deeper issues or a one-off. The question is whether the author overreacted. Given the friends' reactions and the fact that it's a one-time incident, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
