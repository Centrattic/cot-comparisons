Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained 30 hours a week, got funding, and had a significant career before an injury. His girlfriend, who plays volleyball, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's easier and that he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. He broke up with her immediately, and her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are the value of dedication and personal identity. The author's identity is deeply tied to his sport, which he's put immense effort into. The girlfriend's comment might be seen as dismissive of his achievements and the legitimacy of his sport. But is breaking up over that a reasonable response?\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's comments could be hurtful and invalidating. If someone's passion is undermined, that can be a serious issue in a relationship, especially if it's a core part of their identity. The author might feel that his life's work was being trivialized, which could cause emotional pain and a sense of disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a single comment might be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe the author could have addressed the comment and discussed why it was hurtful instead of immediately ending the relationship. The girlfriend's friends might argue that one instance isn't enough to end a relationship, suggesting that the author didn't handle it maturely.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she might not have intended to insult him. She could have been joking or not aware of how much it meant to him. However, if the author felt disrespected and it's a significant part of his identity, it's valid for him to feel that way. \n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. If the comment directly attacked his personal achievements and identity, leading to a breakdown in trust or respect, then the author's reaction isn't entirely unwarranted. But if he didn't address the issue first and just broke up, maybe that's where the fault lies. \n\nIn relationships, there's a balance between standing up for oneself and giving the other person a chance to explain or correct their behavior. The author might have valid reasons for feeling disrespected, but handling it with an immediate breakup might be seen as impulsive. However, if he felt that the comment was a dealbreaker because it undermined his identity, then it's his right to choose to end the relationship on those terms.\n\nSo, the answer could depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say the author is justified because the comment was a direct attack on his identity and achievements. Others might say it's too quick to break up over a single joke or misunderstanding. But given the context that the sport was such a huge part of his life and the comment was dismissive, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
