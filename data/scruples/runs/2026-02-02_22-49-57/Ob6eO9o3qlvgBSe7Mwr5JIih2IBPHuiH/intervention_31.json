Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, even got funding. Then they met their girlfriend after quitting the sport. She was into volleyball. During a conversation about sports, she comments that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's easier than something like soccer. The author dumps her because it felt like an attack on their identity and dedication.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author was wrong to break up. The key points are the girlfriend's comment and the author's reaction. The girlfriend's statement is dismissive and invalidating. Saying trampolining isn't a real sport undermines the author's hard work and achievements. The author felt it was a personal attack, which is understandable given how much they invested in the sport.\n\nThe question is whether the reaction was too harsh. The girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole for breaking up over \"something small,\" but to the author, it's not small. It's about respect for their identity. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as ignorant or disrespectful. People might have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport, but the author's feelings are valid here. They were defending their self-worth.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. Breaking up over a single comment is extreme. But the context is that the comment targeted a core part of their identity. The girlfriend's friends might not understand the depth of the hurt. The author's reaction is a matter of how they perceive respect and validation in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If one partner consistently belittles the other's passions or achievements, that's a problem. However, this was a single incident. But for the author, it might have been the breaking point, especially if they've faced similar dismissals before. The girlfriend's statement was a direct attack on their dedication and success.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to feel that their work and identity were disrespected. The girlfriend's comment was the trigger, and the author made a choice based on how they felt about being respected. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
