Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who was a high-level trampoline gymnast for Canada, dumped his girlfriend after she called trampolining \"not a real sport.\" Her argument was that it's not as popular or difficult as something like soccer, and he immediately ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to this sport, trained 30 hours a week, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. That's a massive commitment. To him, it's a significant part of his identity. So when his girlfriend belittled it, that might have felt like a personal attack on his hard work and achievements.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's point of view. She might not have intended to insult him, just expressing her opinion based on her own understanding. Maybe she didn't realize the depth of his dedication. But the problem is whether her comment was a valid reason to break up. Even if she didn't mean to, it's a public question of whether the author overreacted.\n\nThe friends said he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. But to him, it's not small. He mentions that people have dismissed trampolining his whole life. So this might have been the last straw. The key here is the emotional impact. If the girlfriend's comment triggered feelings of being undervalued or disrespected, which led to the breakup, does that make him in the wrong?\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If one partner undermines the other's passions or accomplishments, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's dismissal of his sport could show a lack of respect for his dedication. However, the immediate breakup might be seen as harsh. Maybe he could have tried to address the issue without ending the relationship right away, especially if there were other factors or if it was an isolated comment.\n\nBut the post emphasizes that the sport is a huge part of his life. To him, it's not just \"something small.\" The question is whether the comment was a deal-breaker. If her attitude contradicts his core values and sense of self, then the breakup might be justified. However, if the relationship had other strengths and this was a single incident, maybe it's too quick. \n\nThe girlfriend's comparison to soccer (\"if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good\") implies that trampolining is less challenging, which could be hurtful. The author might feel that she's minimizing his effort. On the other hand, maybe she didn't realize the actual demands of his training. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on the relationship's context. If their values and respect for each other's passions are a big part of their bond, then her comment was a significant issue. If the breakup was impulsive but based on a core disrespect, then maybe he's justified. But if there are no other issues and the comment was taken out of context, some might say it's too much. \n\nI think the author's reaction is understandable given the importance of the sport to him. Dumping her might be seen as extreme, but if her comment revealed a deeper disrespect, it's a valid reason. The friends' reactions might be from the outside looking in, not understanding the emotional weight. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no other nuance I'm missing. The girlfriend's friends say it's a small matter, but to him, it's a big deal. The key is mutual respect. If she can't respect his achievements, maybe the breakup is right. But maybe he could have used the situation to educate her instead of ending it. However, the post says he \"dumped her on the spot,\" which is immediate. Could he have handled it better? Possibly, but the action was a result of justified hurt. So I lean towards B.\n"
