Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend made fun of his sport, trampolining, saying it's not a real sport. The author took offense and broke up with her. The friends said he was an asshole for doing that over something small. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, trained a lot, competed nationally and internationally, and was even funded. It's a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, played volleyball in high school but not at a high level. When discussing sports, she comments that trampolining isn't a real sport and implies he wouldn't have been good at a more popular sport like soccer. The author feels this is an attack on his identity and dedication, leading him to break up.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. One is whether the girlfriend's comment was a valid opinion or an actual insult. She might have been making a joke or a dismissive remark, but the author took it personally. The problem here is that the comment might have been hurtful if it invalidated his hard work and achievements. But is breaking up over that a reasonable reaction?\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to feel that his dedication was being belittled. If someone mocks a significant part of your identity, that's a serious issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended it as an attack. Maybe she was just making a casual comment, unaware of how much it meant to him. But the author didn't confront her first or give her a chance to explain. He immediately broke up.\n\nThe friends' reaction says that he's an asshole for making a big deal out of it. But maybe they don't understand the emotional weight of the situation. The author's response is extreme\u2014ending a relationship over a single comment. However, if that comment was a reflection of deeper issues, like her not respecting his passions or past, maybe it's a valid reason.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's comment about trampolining not being a real sport could be seen as dismissive. Even if it's her opinion, when you're in a relationship, you should respect each other's passions. Her minimizing his achievements might be a red flag. But breaking up on the spot without discussing it could be seen as overreacting. Maybe he should have addressed the issue calmly instead of ending things immediately.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction is extreme, but the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the comment was an actual attack on his identity, then maybe he's justified. But if it was a minor comment that he overreacted to, then he might be in the wrong. However, the dedication and emotional impact suggest that his feelings were valid. The problem is that breaking up without discussion is harsh. So, it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment was disrespectful, even if he could have handled it better. But maybe he did handle it wrong by not talking it out first. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the comment was invalidating his hard work, but some might argue that the reaction was too harsh. But given the context of dedication, maybe it's understandable.\n"
