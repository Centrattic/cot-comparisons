Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to high-level trampolining, which is a serious sport. They were funded and competed nationally and internationally. When the girlfriend compared trampolining to soccer, saying it's not as hard to get to a high level, the author took offense and ended the relationship. The girlfriend's friends say the author is an asshole for breaking up over this. The author is hurt and feels their identity was attacked.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Breaking up over this seems extreme. While the author's dedication is valid, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend's comment might have been dismissive, but reacting with a breakup could be seen as overreacting. However, the author might feel that their significant investment and identity were not respected. It's a tough call. On one hand, taking a breakup for something like this might be disproportionate. On the other, if the comment hit a nerve and the author couldn't move past it, maybe it's justified. But in terms of right or wrong, relationships aren't black and white. The author might be right to leave if they felt disrespected, but the severity of the reaction could be questionable. The answer hinges on whether the breakup was a valid response to a disrespectful comment or an overreaction. Since the girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole, but the author's feelings are real, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in AITA contexts, the community often looks at whether the action was justified. Here, the action might be seen as too extreme for the situation, making the author the asshole.\n"
