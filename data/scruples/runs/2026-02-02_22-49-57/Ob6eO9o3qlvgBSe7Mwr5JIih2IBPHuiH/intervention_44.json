Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been in the sport for 12 years, trained a lot, competed nationally and internationally, and it's a big part of his identity. She called trampolining not a real sport and implied it wasn't as hard as other sports like soccer. He broke up with her immediately, and her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of her comments. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, which technically makes it a real sport. So her dismissing it as not real is factually incorrect. The author had a significant achievement in his sport, so her belittling his dedication and effort could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nBut then, people have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport. Some might argue that sports like trampolining require a lot of skill, discipline, and training. Others might think team sports are more valid. However, the key issue here isn't just the validity of the sport but how the comment affected the author's self-perception. The sport was a huge part of his life and identity, so her comment could be seen as attacking his values and efforts. \n\nRelationships require respect and support for each other's passions. If one partner undermines the other's achievements or interests, it can cause a major rift. The author felt that she was attacking who he is, which is a valid emotional response. However, the question is whether breaking up over this is justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the depth of his feelings about the sport. People sometimes make offhand comments without considering the emotional impact. If the author had addressed it earlier or discussed the importance of the sport to him, maybe the situation could have been resolved without a breakup. \n\nBut the context is that the author had a long-term dedication, which was a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend downplayed his achievements and compared it unfavorably to other sports. The author felt disrespected, and the breakup was immediate. Her friends' criticism of him as an asshole for overreacting might indicate a cultural bias where certain sports are considered more legitimate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's reaction is based on his emotional connection to his sport. However, breaking up over a single comment might be seen as extreme unless there were prior issues. The key is whether the comment was a deal-breaker for the author. \n\nGiven the circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment directly attacked his identity and dedication. The girlfriend's friends might not understand the depth of his feelings. So the answer leans towards B.\n"
