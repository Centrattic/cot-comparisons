Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, trained a lot, and represented Canada. His girlfriend made fun of the sport as not being a real sport, implying it's less legitimate than others like soccer. He took it as an attack on his identity and broke up with her. His friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but he feels it's about respecting his dedication.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is not wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are about the value of dedication and personal identity versus the other person's comments. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it is recognized as a real sport. However, the girlfriend's comment might come from a place of not understanding the rigor involved. But she's a volleyball player who didn't pursue it to the same level. Maybe she meant that trampolining isn't as popular or difficult as other sports. However, the author took it as a personal attack, which is understandable given his investment.\n\nThe question is whether the break-up was justified. On one hand, the author had a valid reason to feel disrespected. On the other hand, reacting with a breakup over a single conversation might be seen as overreacting, especially if the girlfriend didn't intend it as a major insult. The friends' reactions suggest that they see it as too harsh. But the author's perspective is that this comment attacked his identity and years of work.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the community often looks at whether the action was a reasonable response. If the comment was a deal-breaker and the author felt it was disrespectful to his entire life's work, then he might not be wrong. However, some might argue that using a breakup over such a comment is excessive, especially if the girlfriend didn't realize the impact of her words. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Perhaps the author could have addressed the comment without breaking up, explaining how it hurt him. But if the relationship had other underlying issues, or if this was a recurring problem, the breakup might make sense. However, the story doesn't mention prior issues. It was a single conversation leading to the breakup. That could be seen as impulsive.\n\nThe girlfriend's statement that trampolining isn't as hard as soccer is subjective. If she was comparing the difficulty or prestige, the author is right to defend his sport. But the way she phrased it as \"not a real sport\" is dismissive. The author's reaction is about defending his identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer depends on whether the break-up was a justified response to a disrespectful comment about his dedication. If the comment was a direct attack on his core identity, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the break-up was too harsh without prior discussion, some might say he is. However, given the emotional weight the sport had for him, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
