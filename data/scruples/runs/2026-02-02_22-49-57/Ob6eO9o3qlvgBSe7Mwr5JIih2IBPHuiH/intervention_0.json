Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. The author has a long history of dedication and success in trampolining, which was a significant part of his identity. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing, and she had a bit of volleyball background.\n\nThe key moment is when she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" implying it's less valid than others like soccer. The author felt attacked and ended the relationship. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting. The user thinks the author is not wrong but wants an analysis.\n\nFirst, consider the emotional impact. The author dedicated 12 years, trained intensely, and represented Canada. His identity is intertwined with the sport. When someone devalues that, it's a personal attack. Even if the comment was a joke or a moment of insensitivity, the hurt is real. \n\nNext, relationships require mutual respect. If one partner undermines the other's passions, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's comment wasn't just a joke; she was minimizing his achievements. It's possible she didn't realize how much it meant to him. However, the way he responded\u2014dumping her immediately\u2014might be seen as harsh. But given the depth of his feelings, maybe it was justified. \n\nThe friends' reactions might be biased, especially if they share similar interests. But the core issue is whether the comment was a deal-breaker. The author might have felt that respect for his past was essential. On the other hand, breaking up over a single comment could be overreaction if it wasn't part of a pattern. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, but the author's response could be seen as too immediate. However, considering the emotional weight trampolining holds for him, walking away might be his way of protecting his self-worth. \n\nSo, weighing the factors: The author's reaction is understandable given his history, and respect in a relationship is crucial. The girlfriend's comment was invalidating. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
