Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, and even received funding. He quit due to an injury. His girlfriend, who plays volleyball, made fun of his sport during a conversation about sports. He felt it was an attack on his identity and dumped her on the spot.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional impact on the author. The sport was a huge part of his life and identity. When someone mocks a significant part of your identity, especially something you've dedicated so much time and effort to, it can be deeply hurtful. The girlfriend's comment dismisses the effort and dedication he put into a legitimate sport, even if it's less mainstream. \n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend might not have intended to be disrespectful, but her comment could be seen as belittling. The author's reaction was immediate, which might seem extreme to some, but given the personal significance, others might see it as justified. \n\nThe friends' reactions say he's an asshole, but they might not know the full context of how important trampolining was to him. The author's feelings about being attacked on his identity are valid. So, the question is whether breaking up over this is an overreaction. \n\nOn one hand, the author had every right to feel hurt and disrespected. On the other hand, ending a relationship over a single comment, even if it's a sensitive topic, might be seen as hasty. But considering the emotional weight, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the comment was a genuine disrespect versus a trivial misunderstanding. Trampolining is a recognized sport with competitive levels, so her dismissal could be viewed as invalidating his achievements. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because he stood up for his self-worth. But others might argue that the relationship's value should outweigh the comment. However, given the deep personal significance, it's a valid reason. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
