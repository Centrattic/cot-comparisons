Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining. The author has a history of high-level competition and dedication, which she downplayed by saying it's not a \"real sport\" and that it's easy compared to others like soccer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship. The author's trampolining career was a huge part of his life for 12 years, with significant time and effort. He was even getting funding, which shows the level of commitment. The girlfriend met him after he quit, but she had her own sports background in volleyball. \n\nThe key point is her comment. She dismissed his sport as not real and implied that he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. This directly undermined his achievements and identity. For someone who invested so much into their sport, having it belittled can feel like a personal attack. The author felt that she was attacking who he is as a person, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's friends said the author was an asshole for breaking up over something small. But is it really small? The author saw it as a major disrespect to his life's work. The girlfriend might not have realized the depth of his feelings about the sport. However, the way she phrased her comments could be seen as dismissive and condescending. \n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's values and achievements is crucial. If one partner consistently belittles the other's passions, it can lead to resentment. The author's decision to end the relationship might seem extreme, but it's his way of valuing his identity and not tolerating disrespect. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend didn't intend to hurt him, and the author overreacted. But considering the emotional impact, and the fact that her words hit a sensitive spot, the reaction might be justified. It's about mutual respect. If someone makes you feel devalued, it's reasonable to reassess the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's comments were a legitimate disrespect or an overblown issue. Given the author's perspective and the hurt caused, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. He chose to stand up for his self-worth.\n"
