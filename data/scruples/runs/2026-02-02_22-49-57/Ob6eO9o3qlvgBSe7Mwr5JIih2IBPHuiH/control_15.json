Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether breaking up with a girlfriend over her making fun of his sport is justified. \n\nFirst, the author is a former high-level trampoline athlete, which he's clearly very proud of. He dedicated 12 years to it, trained a lot, and even got funding. Then he got injured and had to quit. His girlfriend made comments downplaying his sport, saying it's not a real sport, and that others could have been better if he'd played a \"real\" sport like soccer. The author took it really hard and broke up with her on the spot. Her friends and others are saying he overreacted.\n\nSo, the user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). Let's break it down. The key points are:\n\n1. **Validity of the Sport**: Trampoline is an Olympic sport and has a competitive scene. While it might not be as popular as soccer, it's definitely a legitimate sport. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive and invalidating of his achievements.\n\n2. **Emotional Impact**: The author's reaction is based on his deep emotional investment in the sport. For someone who dedicated so much time and effort, having someone belittle that part of his identity can be hurtful. It's possible that the breakup was a reaction to feeling devalued, not just about the sport itself.\n\n3. **Proportionality**: The question is whether breaking up over this is too much. People have different thresholds for what they consider unacceptable. If the comment touched on a core part of his identity and the relationship had issues in communication, maybe it's understandable. However, some might say that a single comment isn't enough to end a relationship.\n\n4. **Communication**: The girlfriend's tone and intent matter. If she was joking or trying to be facetious, maybe she didn't mean to hurt him. But the way she framed it (\"it's not a real sport\") could come across as serious and disrespectful. The author might not have felt heard or respected.\n\n5. **Context of the Relationship**: The story doesn't mention other issues, so it's possible that this was a deal-breaker for him. However, in some cases, people might handle such comments through discussion rather than immediate breakup.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? If he felt that the comment was a direct attack on his identity and past achievements, he might not be entirely at fault. However, some might argue that breaking up over a single conversation is overreacting, especially if there's no prior history of such issues. The girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole, which suggests some social judgment here. But the author's perspective is valid given the personal significance of the sport to him.\n\nIn the AITA format, people often consider the emotional weight of the issue. Since the author's reaction was based on deep personal investment and the comment seemed dismissive, it's a bit of a gray area. However, given that relationships require mutual respect and understanding, the girlfriend's comment was unkind, and the author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as a stand for being valued. But others might say it's too harsh. The answer likely depends on whether the comment was a one-time thing or indicative of deeper disrespect. Since it's presented as a one-time incident, the answer could swing either way. But given the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
