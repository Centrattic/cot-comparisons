Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up a relationship because a girlfriend made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, the author has put in a lot of time and effort into trampolining, which was a big part of his identity. The girlfriend dismissed it as not being a real sport, suggesting it's easy compared to something like soccer. The author felt attacked, which led him to break up with her. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, making fun of someone's passion can be really hurtful, especially when it's a core part of their identity. The author's reaction might be seen as justified because the comment was a direct attack on his dedication and achievements. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that breaking up over a single comment is too extreme. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole for overreacting. Maybe she didn't intend to hurt him, or perhaps she could have been corrected and apologized. \n\nBut considering the emotional impact of the comment, which invalidated his years of commitment, the author might feel that the relationship was built on mutual respect, which was violated. If the girlfriend couldn't respect his passion, it might be a deal-breaker for him. \n\nSo, I think the answer depends on how much weight you give to the emotional harm versus the reaction. If the comment was a deal-breaker for the author, then he's not in the wrong. But if others see it as an overreaction, maybe he is. However, since the comment directly attacked his identity and the breakup was immediate, it's understandable. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
