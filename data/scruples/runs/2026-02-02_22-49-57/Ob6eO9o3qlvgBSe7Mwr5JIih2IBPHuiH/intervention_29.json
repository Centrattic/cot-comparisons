Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend made fun of his sport, trampolining, by saying it's not a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a more popular sport like soccer. The author dedicated 12 years to this sport, which was a huge part of his life, and he felt it was a personal attack.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a significant commitment to his sport, which is valid. The girlfriend's comments were dismissive and belittling. She compared it to a more mainstream sport, implying that his dedication wasn't as meaningful. That's probably where the hurt came from. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for breaking up over this. On one hand, people can be sensitive about their passions, and if someone disrespects that, it's a big deal. The author might feel that his identity and achievements were undermined. On the other hand, some might argue that breaking up over a single comment is too harsh, especially if the relationship had other positive aspects. But the girlfriend's friends said the author was an asshole, which suggests they don't see the comment as a valid reason to end the relationship.\n\nBut looking deeper, the girlfriend's comments were not just a joke but a direct attack on the value of his effort and the sport itself. If someone mocks your core identity or achievements, that can be a deal-breaker. The author felt it was an attack on who he is, which is a strong reason to end the relationship. The friends' reactions might not account for the emotional impact of such a comment. \n\nAlso, considering mutual respect in a relationship is crucial. If one partner doesn't respect the other's passions and efforts, it's a red flag. The girlfriend's response shows a lack of appreciation for his dedication, which could lead to more conflicts. So, the author's decision might be justified as protecting his self-worth and ensuring mutual respect. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
