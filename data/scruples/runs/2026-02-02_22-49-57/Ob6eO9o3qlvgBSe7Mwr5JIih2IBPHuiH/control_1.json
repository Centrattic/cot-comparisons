Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her mocking his sport is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man was a high-level trampoline gymnast, dedicating 12 years and 30 hours a week to his sport. He got injured and had to stop, but it was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easy compared to others like soccer. He broke up with her immediately because he felt she was attacking his identity and dedication.\n\nThe key points here are: the man's deep emotional connection to his sport, the girlfriend's dismissive comment about its legitimacy, and the immediate breakup. Now, I need to evaluate if he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's comment was clearly hurtful and dismissive of his hard work. For someone who has dedicated so much of their life to something, that kind of remark can feel like a personal attack. The man's reaction might seem extreme to some, but considering the context of his dedication and the personal offense, it's understandable. The girlfriend's friends thought he was an asshole for breaking up over a small thing, but \"small\" might be subjective here. To him, it was significant because it touched on his identity.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that while the comment was rude, a breakup over such an issue is overreacting. Relationships often require compromise and not taking everything personally. However, the man's reaction was immediate, which could suggest that the comment hit a nerve he couldn't ignore, and maybe there were underlying issues.\n\nBut looking at the facts, the comment was about dismissing his sport's legitimacy, which is a core part of his identity. People take pride in their achievements, and having that belittled can be a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's friends might not see it as a big deal, but that doesn't negate the man's feelings. It's possible that if the roles were reversed, the girlfriend would feel similarly if her volleyball was mocked.\n\nThe question is whether the man is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the breakup was justified. Since the comment directly attacked his dedication and the sport he's proud of, and he felt it was a personal attack, I think his reaction is a valid response to feeling disrespected. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's another angle. Could the girlfriend have been just joking and not meant to hurt? The way she phrased it (\"It's not hard to get to a high level...\") sounds more like a serious jab rather than a joke. So, her comment was inconsiderate, and his reaction, while sudden, is a matter of personal boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, while some might say the breakup was over a minor issue, the comment struck at the core of his identity. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
