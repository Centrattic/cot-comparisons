Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The man has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, reached national and international levels, and it's a huge part of his identity. His girlfriend, after he's retired from the sport, makes a comment dismissing trampolining as not a real sport, implying that it's less challenging than other sports like soccer. The man takes this as a personal attack and breaks up with her.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She might not have intended to be disrespectful, maybe she was just making a joke or not aware of how much the sport meant to him. However, she did say trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. That's a bit dismissive and undermines his dedication and achievements.\n\nThe man's reaction is immediate: he dumps her because he feels attacked. The friends think he overreacted. The question is whether breaking up over this is justified.\n\nFrom the man's side, after giving so much to his sport and it being such a core part of his identity, having someone belittle that could feel like a personal attack. It's possible that the comment triggered feelings of invalidation, especially if he's faced similar sentiments before. His reaction, while sudden, might be rooted in deep emotional investment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment could be seen as thoughtless. Even if she meant it as a joke, the way it was phrased might come off as dismissive. However, breaking up over a single comment, especially in a relationship where he's already retired from the sport, could be seen as extreme unless there were prior issues.\n\nBut looking at the details: he was very open about his sport, and she knew how important it was. Her comment directly challenged the validity of his sport, which he had worked so hard to achieve. The man's reaction is about defending his identity and past dedication. In relationships, respecting each other's values and past is crucial. If she trivialized something that's a big part of his identity, maybe the breakup isn't unwarranted.\n\nAlso, the friends saying he's an asshole might not take into account the emotional weight he placed on the sport. People close to him might not understand the depth of that dedication. So, while the breakup seems hasty to some, if the comment was a dealbreaker for him, he's not entirely wrong to leave.\n"
