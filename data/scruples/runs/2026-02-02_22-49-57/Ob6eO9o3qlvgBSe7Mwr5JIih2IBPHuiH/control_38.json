Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy was a high-level athlete in trampolining, dedicating 12 years and 30 hours a week. It's a huge part of his identity. When his girlfriend says trampolining isn't a real sport, comparing it to soccer where it's harder to be good, he takes it as a personal attack and dumps her. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's reacting to something that deeply affects his self-worth. If someone mocks your passion or downplays your achievements, that's hurtful. But is breaking up over that justified? It depends on the context. \n\nThe girlfriend's comment seems dismissive, which is rude. But is it a deal-breaker? Maybe the guy felt it invalidated his life's work, so his reaction is emotional. However, relationships require communication and understanding. Instead of immediately breaking up, maybe addressing the issue and explaining how it makes him feel would have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone's core identity is being attacked, it's understandable to feel hurt. But did the girlfriend intend to be malicious, or was she just making a flippant comment? If it was the latter, the reaction might be disproportionate. \n\nThe friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over a small thing, but the comment wasn't about minor things\u2014it was about his significant life achievements. But maybe the issue is that he didn't handle the conflict better. \n\nIn relationships, major arguments often come from smaller issues building up. If this was a one-time comment and he immediately ended the relationship, that might be seen as overreacting. However, if it's part of a pattern where she consistently undervalues his passions, it could be a valid reason. \n\nSince the scenario is presented as a single conversation, without prior issues, it's tricky. The guy felt deeply attacked, but the response was immediate and final. So the question is: was the breakup justified, or was it an overreaction? \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no clear answer. But in the context of the AITA format, the community often looks at hurt feelings vs. overreaction. The girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive, but breaking up over it might be seen as extreme. The guy has a valid grievance, but the method of handling it (dumping her immediately) might be seen as wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if he felt that his core identity was being attacked, it's a serious issue. However, relationships also require compromise. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because the breakup was too harsh, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the comment was a deal-breaker for him, then B, not in the wrong. \n\nBut the AITA community often considers the intent. If the girlfriend was being intentionally dismissive, maybe the guy was right to leave. However, without more context, the comment seems thoughtless. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the breakup was over a single comment, but I'm conflicted.\n"
