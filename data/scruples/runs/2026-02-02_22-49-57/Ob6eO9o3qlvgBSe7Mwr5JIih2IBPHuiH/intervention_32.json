Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after dumping their girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was a high-level trampolinist, dedicated 12 years, trained extensively, competed nationally and internationally, even got funding. Then he quit due to a head injury. He met his girlfriend after that, and she knew about his sport and found it cool. They were discussing sports, and she said trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than others like soccer, and that he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport. He took that as an attack on his identity and dumped her immediately. Now people are saying he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but he feels justified because it's a core part of his identity.\n\nSo the question is whether he was wrong. The user says the author is not in the wrong, but wants my thoughts. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's comment was dismissive of his achievements and the sport he's passionate about. For someone who put in so much effort, that could feel like a personal attack. The author might have felt that his identity was being undermined, which is a significant issue in a relationship. If respect for each other's values and backgrounds is important, then the girlfriend's remark could be seen as disrespectful, leading to the breakup being justified.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, might seem extreme. The girlfriend might have been making a joke or trying to be lighthearted, not realizing how sensitive it would be. Some might argue that the author overreacted, especially if the relationship had other strengths. However, the key here is the depth of the issue. If the sport is a core part of his identity, then a derogatory comment about it can be a deal-breaker. It's not just about the sport but about mutual respect and understanding in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comment suggests a lack of validation and understanding of his dedication. In relationships, respecting each other's passions and achievements is crucial. If one partner consistently belittles the other's important values, that can lead to bigger issues. The author might have realized that the relationship wasn't built on mutual respect for each other's identities, so ending it was the right call.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's comparison to soccer might imply she values more mainstream sports, but that's her perspective. However, the author's achievements in trampolining are real and significant. The fact that her friends said he was an asshole might reflect a tendency to downplay the emotional impact of such comments, which often happen to people in non-mainstream fields.\n\nIn conclusion, while the breakup might seem harsh at first glance, the underlying issue is about respect and validation of personal achievements and identity. If the girlfriend couldn't respect his passion, that's a red flag. The author's decision could be seen as standing up for his self-worth, so he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
