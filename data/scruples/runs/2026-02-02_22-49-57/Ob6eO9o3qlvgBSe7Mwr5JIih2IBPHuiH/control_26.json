Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained a lot, got funding, but then had a head injury and quit. The girlfriend, who met him after he stopped, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport. He took offense and broke up immediately. His friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo the question is whether his reaction was justified. Let's break it down. The key points here are the value of the sport he's invested so much in, the girlfriend's comment, and the decision to end the relationship because of that.\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a real sport. The girlfriend's comment that it's not a real sport is dismissive and undermines his dedication. The author feels that she's attacking his identity because the sport was such a huge part of his life. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend was just making a joke or a light-hearted comment, not realizing how it would affect him. But the way she phrased it\u2014\"It's not hard to get to a high level if you played a real sport\"\u2014could be seen as belittling his achievements. \n\nIs breaking up over that too much? Well, relationships require respect for each other's values and efforts. If a partner's main interest or a significant part of their identity is dismissed, that can be a deal-breaker. The author's reaction might be seen as extreme, but if the comment was hurtful and disrespectful, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends think it's a small issue. However, for the author, it's a big deal because it's tied to his identity and the years he invested. People can have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable in a relationship. \n\nSo, considering that the comment was disrespectful and the sport is a legitimate one, the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that reacting by breaking up is too harsh. But given the emotional impact and the significance of the sport to him, it's a valid reason for some people. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful to his significant life achievements. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe the girlfriend could have apologized, but the author's immediate breakup might be seen as impulsive. However, if the comment was a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice. So, probably B.\n"
