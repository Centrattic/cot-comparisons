Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been really dedicated to it for years, even getting funding, and it's a big part of his identity. She said trampolining isn't a real sport and that if he had done a \"real\" sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. He took that as a personal attack and ended the relationship. His friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is valid because he's invested a lot into his sport, which is a significant part of his self-worth. Being told his sport isn't real could feel like a dismissal of his achievements and identity. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might have been a joke or a light-hearted way of teasing, not necessarily a serious critique. She might not have realized how much it would hurt him. But she also didn't acknowledge his accomplishments and dismissed his passion, which is hurtful.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over this could be seen as extreme, but if the comment touched a deep emotional wound and he felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe not. The key is consent and mutual respect in a relationship. If she repeatedly belittled his passions, it's valid to leave. But if it was a one-time joke, maybe overreacting? However, the fact that he's been dealing with this judgment before (as mentioned in the story) adds context. The girlfriend's friends said he's an asshole, but maybe they don't understand the depth of his feelings. \n\nIn the end, the decision to break up is personal. If the relationship had other issues or if she was dismissive of his feelings, it's justified. But if it's just a single comment, maybe. However, given the context of his dedication and her invalidating his achievements, the author might be justified in ending it. So the answer is likely B.\n"
