Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampolining athlete, training for 30 hours a week, representing Canada, and it was a huge part of his identity. He quit due to injury. They met after he stopped competing. She used to play volleyball but not as intensely. During a conversation about sports, she downplayed trampolining as not a real sport, suggesting it's not as hard as something like soccer. The author took it personally and broke up immediately. Her friends think he's being too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's sport being a significant part of his identity, the girlfriend's dismissal of it, and the immediate breakup. The question is whether the breakup was justified.\n\nI need to consider if the girlfriend's comment was a deal-breaker. The author felt attacked because his passion was belittled. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's a real sport. Her comment could be seen as invalidating his years of dedication. However, breaking up over a single conversation might seem extreme to some. But for others, if their core identity is disrespected, they might see it as justified.\n\nThe author's friends and family might think the reaction is too harsh, but it's also possible that respecting each other's passions is crucial in a relationship. If the girlfriend didn't acknowledge his achievements and felt his sport wasn't valid, that could indicate a lack of respect. The author might have felt that her inability to respect his dedication was a fundamental issue.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the girlfriend was just making a joke or a light-hearted comment, not intending to belittle his sport. The author might have overreacted. However, given the context of his deep commitment and her dismissive attitude, it's hard to see it as just a joke. The fact that she compared it to soccer, implying it's easier, might have been the trigger.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's passions is important. If the girlfriend couldn't respect his sport, which was a big part of his life, maybe the breakup was necessary for him to be with someone who values him. But some might argue that one comment shouldn't end a relationship, and that communication could have resolved it.\n\nThe author's reaction is extreme, but if the comment went to the core of his identity and made him feel disrespected, it's understandable. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's comment was a valid criticism or a disrespectful dismissal. Since trampolining is an Olympic sport and he was at a high level, her comment seems dismissive and ignorant of his dedication. Therefore, the author's decision to break up might be justified.\n"
