Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been heavily involved in it for 12 years, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, plays volleyball. When discussing sports, she said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than real sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and dumped her, but her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective is that his dedication and achievements in a sport that's considered less mainstream were disrespected. Trampolining is an Olympic sport now, but maybe it's still seen as niche. He invested a lot of time and effort, and his identity is tied to it. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as belittling his accomplishments. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend didn't mean to be dismissive. She might have been trying to compare her own experience with volleyball. But the way she phrased it, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easier than soccer, could come across as invalidating. \n\nThe author's reaction was immediate breakup. That's a big step. But considering how important this sport is to him, maybe the comment hit a nerve. People can have different perspectives on what constitutes a \"real\" sport. The girlfriend's friends think it's a minor issue, but they might not understand the personal significance. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on context. If the girlfriend had a history of mocking him, or if this was a one-off comment, it might be different. But the comment itself did attack his identity and achievements. The author might feel that such a remark undermines his hard work. However, reacting with a breakup might be seen as extreme, especially if there's no prior conflict. \n\nBut maybe the comment was the last straw. In relationships, how partners respect each other's values and efforts matters. If one partner's core value is disrespected, it can lead to a breakup. The key here is whether the girlfriend's comment was a genuine misunderstanding or a deliberate put-down. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the comment directly attacked his identity and achievements in a sport that was central to his life. However, the immediacy of the breakup might be seen as harsh. But given the personal stakes, it's a valid reaction. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
