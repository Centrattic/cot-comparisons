Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampolinist, spent 12 years training, competed nationally and internationally, got funding, and it was a significant part of his identity. After he stopped competing, he met his girlfriend, who seemed to respect his achievements initially. However, during a conversation where she expressed a desire to have pursued volleyball more, the author shared his experience, and she responded by saying trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than other sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up immediately. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting, but he feels justified.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the emotional impact of the comment, the value of personal dedication, and the appropriateness of the breakup.\n\nFirst, the comment from the girlfriend. She made a judgment about a sport that he deeply values, which is central to his identity. Even if she didn't intend to, her words could be seen as dismissive. However, people have different perspectives on what constitutes a \"real sport,\" and some might not mean it as an attack. But given the context, her comparison to soccer and the implication that trampolining was easy could be hurtful.\n\nThe author's reaction: breaking up immediately. This is a drastic response. While the comment was hurtful, is the breakup proportional? The question is whether the girlfriend's comment crossed a line. If the author felt that his entire identity was being attacked, maybe it's not a small issue. But others might say that it's a minor disagreement and not worth ending a relationship over. The friends' opinion is that he's overreacting, but the author's feelings are valid.\n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's passions is important. If one partner constantly belittles the other's achievements or interests, that's a red flag. But a single comment doesn't necessarily mean a deal-breaker. The author might need to consider whether this was an isolated incident or part of a pattern. However, in this case, the girlfriend's comment struck a nerve because it targeted something so central to his identity.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the comment was hurtful and the breakup was a result of feeling disrespected, maybe not. But relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe a better approach would have been to discuss the hurt feelings instead of immediate breakup. However, the author's decision was based on feeling attacked, which is a significant emotional trigger.\n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's comment could be seen as a harmless opinion, and the author overreacted. But the context of his dedication and the emotional impact must be considered. The answer might hinge on whether the comment was a genuine opinion or a belittling remark.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision might be seen as justified given the emotional impact, but some might argue that the breakup was excessive. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's comment was genuinely disrespectful, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if it was a minor opinion, then maybe the breakup was too harsh. Given the details, I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the comment attacked his core identity, and relationships should respect each other's values."
