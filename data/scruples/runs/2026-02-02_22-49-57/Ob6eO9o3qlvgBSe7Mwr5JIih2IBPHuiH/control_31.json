Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she said trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete for 12 years, training intensively and competing nationally and internationally. He quit due to a head injury. They met after he stopped, and she initially thought it was cool. But during a conversation about sports, she downgraded trampolining, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easier than, say, soccer. He took offense and broke up with her immediately. Her friends are saying he's being too harsh.\n\nSo, the question is whether his reaction was justified. On one hand, trampolining is a recognized sport in Canada and internationally. The author put in thousands of hours and achieved a high level, which is a significant personal accomplishment. Being told that his sport isn't \"real\" might feel like a dismissal of his effort and identity. For someone whose life was so tied to the sport, this could be a sensitive issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have meant to attack his identity. She played volleyball and perhaps viewed it as a more common or traditional sport. Her comment could be a result of not fully understanding the dedication required for trampolining. However, her statement is dismissive and potentially condescending. The phrase \"if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good\" is particularly hurtful, implying that trampolining is easier and that his achievements are less valid.\n\nThe author's reaction is immediate and decisive. Breaking up over an argument can be extreme, but if the comment hit a nerve related to his self-worth and life's work, maybe it's not entirely unfounded. The key factors here are intent vs. impact. Even if the girlfriend didn't mean to be malicious, the impact of her words on the author was significant. The friends saying he's an asshole might think it's overreacting, but they might not understand the emotional weight of his dedication to trampolining.\n\nIn relationships, how people handle each other's insecurities is important. If the girlfriend's comment was a rare slip-up, maybe the author could have addressed it without ending the relationship. But if this was part of a pattern where she consistently devalued his passions, then it makes more sense. Since the post mentions this was during a conversation and she made that comparison, it's a one-time incident. However, the author might have felt that if she couldn't respect his past, it would lead to more issues in the future.\n\nTrampolining is indeed a legitimate sport, part of the Olympics and with rigorous training. Her minimizing it could reflect a lack of respect for his experiences. The author's job here is to consider whether her comment was a one-time misunderstanding or part of a larger issue of disrespect. Since the breakup was immediate and based on this single comment, it might be seen as overreacting by some. But others might sympathize with him because of the personal significance of the sport to his identity.\n\nSo, it's a tough call. The girlfriend's words were hurtful and devaluing, which is a problem. The author's reaction is extreme, but if his self-worth is tied to his sport, it's understandable. The answer depends on the value placed on mutual respect in a relationship. If she can't respect his accomplishments, it might be a red flag. However, the sudden decision to end the relationship might be seen as disproportionate. But the core issue is her invalidating his efforts. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong. I think the answer is B: No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
