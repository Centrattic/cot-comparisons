Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend made fun of his sport, trampolining. The user is asking if it's wrong for him to break up over that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, which is a significant investment. He was at a high level, representing Canada, and had funding. That's a big deal. When his girlfriend dismissed it as not a \"real\" sport and said it wasn't hard to get good compared to something like soccer, he took it personally and ended the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended to invalidate his achievements. Maybe she was being flippant or didn't understand the dedication involved. People can make offhand comments without realizing the impact. But the author felt that she was attacking his identity and past efforts, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nThe key points here are the value of communication and mutual respect in a relationship. If someone's passion is disrespected, even if unintentionally, it can cause hurt. The author's reaction might seem extreme to some because it's a single comment, but if that comment triggered deep-seated insecurities or felt like a personal attack, it's understandable. \n\nHer friends called him an asshole, but maybe they don't see the context of his long-term dedication. The author's perspective is that his sport is a huge part of who he is, and being dismissed could be a deal-breaker. Whether that's justified depends on the relationship's dynamics. However, breaking up over one comment could be hasty if she didn't realize her mistake and there was a chance to address it. \n\nBut considering the emotional impact and the fact that the comment was a direct attack on his identity, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. It's a tough call, but the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because respecting each other's passions is crucial. However, some might argue that the situation wasn't that serious and that the breakup was overreacting. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the comment was a genuine dismissal of his efforts or just a joke. If it was the former, then the author's reaction is more justified. The answer might depend on whether the comment was intentional. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the dedication and emotional response, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
