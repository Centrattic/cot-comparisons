Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, competed internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. His girlfriend dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, comparing it to something like soccer where he wouldn't have been as good. He took it as an attack on his dedication and self-worth, leading to a breakup. His friends think he was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. Relationships require respect for each other's passions and achievements. If someone's hobby or career is a significant part of their identity, it's important for the partner to acknowledge that. The girlfriend's comments seem dismissive and disrespectful. She's undermining his accomplishments, which he clearly values a lot. \n\nHowever, people can have different perspectives on what's important. The girlfriend might not have realized how much the sport meant to him. But in a healthy relationship, communication is key. If she made a comment that hurt him and he felt attacked, maybe he should have addressed it earlier instead of waiting until the breakup. Still, the fact that he invested so much time and got recognition in his sport means it's a core part of his identity. Her dismissal could be seen as invalidating his efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, dumping someone over a single conversation might be harsh. But considering the context\u2014his sport being central to his life and her belittling it\u2014it's a significant issue. The friends' reactions might not understand the depth of the hurt he felt. \n\nSo, is he wrong? If the relationship had other issues or if this was an isolated incident where he overreacted, maybe A. But given the girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his identity and the history of similar dismissals he's faced, B (not in the wrong) makes sense. He had the right to feel disrespected and seek a partner who values his achievements.\n"
