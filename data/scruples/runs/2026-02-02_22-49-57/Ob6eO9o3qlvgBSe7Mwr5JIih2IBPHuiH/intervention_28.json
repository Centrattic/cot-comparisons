Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, got funding, and had a head injury. After he quit, he met his girlfriend, who initially thought his sport was cool. Then, during a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport and implied that if he had played a \"real\" sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. The author felt this was an attack on his identity and broke up with her immediately. Her friends said the author was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. Breaking up over a single comment can seem drastic. But the comment was about something central to his identity. Trampolining is a real Olympic sport, so her dismissal might be incorrect. However, people often have different perceptions of what's a real sport. \n\nThe key points are whether the comment was a deal-breaker. The author felt deeply hurt, which is valid because his sport was a huge part of his life. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended to be dismissive, but her words were hurtful. \n\nIf the relationship had other issues, maybe the breakup is justified. But if this was the first time she ever said something like that, maybe it's an overreaction. However, the author's perspective is that his identity was attacked. Trampolining is a legitimate sport, so her comment might be based on a misunderstanding. \n\nThe friends said he's in the wrong for breaking up over \"something small,\" but maybe they don't realize how significant the sport was to him. The author's reaction is about respecting each other's passions and not belittling them. If the girlfriend can't respect his dedication, maybe the relationship had deeper issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful to his identity, and if respect is a foundational value, then the breakup is justified. But it's a close call. However, given the context of the sport's importance to him and the dismissive comment, the author's decision to leave is understandable. Therefore, B.\n"
