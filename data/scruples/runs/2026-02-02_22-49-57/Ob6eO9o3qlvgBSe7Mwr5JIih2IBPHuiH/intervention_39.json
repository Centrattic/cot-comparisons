Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she criticized his sport, trampolining, as not being a \"real sport.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points from the story. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national and international competitor, trained extensively, and even received funding. This sport was a huge part of his identity. When the girlfriend downplays the sport's legitimacy and compares it to more popular sports like soccer, he dumps her immediately. His friends and others think he's being an asshole over a small issue.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether dismissing the legitimacy of someone's passion or career is a valid reason to end a relationship. The girlfriend's comment was clearly an insult to his identity and achievements. He felt attacked, which is understandable given the investment he made in the sport. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner consistently undermines the other's significant life achievements, that's a red flag.\n\nBut then again, is a single comment enough to justify a breakup? Some might argue that people have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real sport,\" and a one-time joke or offhand remark shouldn't end a relationship. However, others might say that if this comment came from a place of disrespect and was part of a pattern of belittling his efforts, it's a deal-breaker.\n\nI should also consider the context. The author mentions that he's faced similar sentiments throughout his life, implying he's experienced invalidation before. The girlfriend's friends think he's overreacting, but the author's perspective is that this was a significant part of his life being dismissed. In relationships, respect is key, and if someone doesn't respect your passions or achievements, it can lead to deeper issues. \n\nThe key here is the emotional impact. The author felt that his identity and years of dedication were being attacked. If someone's core values or identity are repeatedly undermined, that's a serious issue. While the girlfriend might not have intended to hurt him, the comment was a direct attack on something he holds in high regard. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: On one hand, breaking up over a single comment could be seen as excessive. But on the other hand, if that comment reflects a deeper disrespect and invalidation of a central part of his life, it's not just about the sport but about how he's perceived by his partner. Respecting each other's passions is crucial in any relationship. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because the breakup was a result of his feelings being consistently hurt, not just a random overreaction. The girlfriend's comment was a trigger that highlighted a larger issue of disrespect. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
