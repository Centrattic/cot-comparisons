Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, and even got funding. It's a huge part of his identity. Then, his girlfriend comments that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than others like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up immediately. Now, people are saying he was too harsh over something small. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the dynamics here. The girlfriend made a dismissive comment about a part of his identity. For someone who's invested so much into their sport, that could be really hurtful. But does that justify breaking up? Well, maybe not immediately. A good relationship should involve communication and understanding. However, the comment was a direct attack on his passion and dedication, which is personal. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might not have been intended to be that harsh. Maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to him. But in a relationship, partners should be aware of each other's sensitivities. If this was a recurring issue, it's one thing, but here it's a one-time comment. Still, the author's reaction is immediate and decisive, which could be seen as extreme. However, if the comment touched a nerve that's been a source of insecurity for him, maybe it's a valid response.\n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's statement was disrespectful to his identity and achievements, leading to the breakup. The community says it's too small, but the personal impact might be significant. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not. If the comment was hurtful and he felt it devalued his hard work, then his reaction is understandable. Relationships require mutual respect, and if a partner disrespects a core part of your identity, that's a major issue. However, the immediate breakup without discussion could be seen as impulsive. But given the emotional weight of the comment, maybe it's justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). The girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his passion and identity, which can be a deal-breaker. The community's reaction might be dismissive of the personal hurt involved. Therefore, it's not the author's fault for ending the relationship when he felt disrespected in such a core aspect of his life.\n"
