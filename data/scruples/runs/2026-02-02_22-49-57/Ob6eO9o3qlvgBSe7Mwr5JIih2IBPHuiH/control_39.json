Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend after she made fun of their sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a significant part of their identity. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" implying it's less valid or less challenging. The author took this personally and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nThe core issue here is whether the reaction was justified. The author feels deeply insulted because their passion and dedication were belittled. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as a general opinion, but for someone with such a strong connection to their sport, it might feel like an attack on their identity. However, relationships often require tolerance for each other's interests, even if they're not fully shared or understood. The question is whether this comment was a bridge too far or an overreaction.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be upset when their accomplishments are mocked. On the other hand, breaking up over a single comment might be seen as extreme unless there were prior issues. The girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole, suggesting others might view the reaction as disproportionate. However, the author's history of dedication and the emotional weight of the comment could justify their feelings.\n\nI need to weigh whether the severity of the comment deserved such a strong response. If the girlfriend had a history of undermining the author's passions, maybe the breakup is justified. But if this was an isolated incident, maybe the author overreacted. However, the comment did touch on the validity of a significant part of the author's identity, which can be a deal-breaker for some people. Deciding between A or B depends on whether the action was a justified stand on personal values or an overreaction. Given the context, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment struck a core part of their identity, even if the breakup seems hasty to others.\n"
