Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author breaks up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining, which he dedicated 12 years to, \"not a real sport.\" The girlfriend's friends say the author is an asshole for breaking up over something small. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that trampolining is a real sport with a lot of dedication, training, and competition. He was at a high level, even getting funding. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive, implying that his sport isn't as valid as others like soccer. The author felt this was an attack on his identity and the thousands of hours he invested. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friends think the issue is minor. Maybe they feel that while the comment was hurtful, breaking up over it is an overreaction. But I should also consider why the author reacted that way. His sport meant a lot to him, so a comment like that could be a significant emotional trigger. \n\nIs calling a sport \"not real\" inherently disrespectful? That depends on context. If someone's entire identity and career are tied to that sport, then such a remark can be deeply hurtful. The girlfriend might not have intended to dismiss all the effort he put in, but her words did exactly that. \n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend's point was about the visibility or popularity of the sport. She might think that trampolining isn't as mainstream as soccer, so it's easier to reach high levels. But even if that's the case, it's not fair to invalidate someone's achievements. The fact that he was in the top 500 worldwide shows that it's a legitimate sport requiring skill and dedication.\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate\u2014dumping her on the spot. That could be seen as impulsive. But again, if this comment touched a nerve about his self-worth and identity, maybe the breakup was a response to feeling disrespected rather than the comment itself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend made a thoughtless comment without considering how it would affect him, then she's at fault. But if the author overreacted by breaking up over something that could be a misunderstanding or a joke, then he might share some responsibility. However, given the emotional weight of the issue for the author, the breakup might be a justified response to feeling attacked. \n\nI think the key here is whether the girlfriend's comment was malicious or just ignorant. If she meant to belittle his achievements, then the author's reaction is understandable. If it was a casual, offhand remark, maybe the author overreacted. But since the author's sport is such a big part of his identity, the hurt is real. The friends might dismiss it as small, but for him, it's significant. \n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive, the author's immediate breakup might be seen as an overreaction. However, considering the depth of the personal significance, the author's reaction could be a valid response to feeling disrespected. It's a bit of a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment undermined his identity.\n"
