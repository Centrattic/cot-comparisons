Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to think through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a \"real\" sport. The guy dedicated a lot of time to it, was a high-level athlete, and now the girlfriend made a comment that seemed to belittle his achievements.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend made a dismissive comment about his sport, implying it's not as legitimate as others like soccer. That might have been a trigger because his identity is tied to that sport. He felt attacked, which is understandable given his dedication. \n\nBut was the breakup justified? Relationships often require compromise and respect for each other's passions. If the girlfriend made a one-time comment, maybe it was a misunderstanding or a joke that didn't realize the impact. However, if this was part of a pattern where she consistently disrespected his achievements or the sport, then it's more severe. \n\nOn the other hand, ending a relationship over a single statement can be impulsive. The girlfriend's friends think he's being too harsh, which might indicate that the comment wasn't as malicious as he perceived it. But the emotional weight of the comment for him is significant. \n\nI should also consider if the girlfriend's statement was a valid opinion versus an attack. People can have different views on what constitutes a \"real\" sport, but expressing that shouldn't negate someone's accomplishments. However, the way she phrased it (\"if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good\") could be seen as diminishing his effort and talent. \n\nThe key factors are whether the comment was an isolated incident or part of a larger pattern, and whether the breakup was a proportionate response. If the sport is a core part of his identity, then her comment might have crossed a line. But if the relationship had other issues, that's another angle. \n\nSince the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the reaction was reasonable. He felt attacked, and if that's a deal-breaker, maybe not. However, walking away immediately might not allow for discussion and clarification. So there's a balance between respecting personal values and the maturity of the relationship response.\n"
