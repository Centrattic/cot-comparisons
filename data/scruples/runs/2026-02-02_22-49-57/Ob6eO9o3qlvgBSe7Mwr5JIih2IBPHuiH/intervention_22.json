Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, got national/international competition experience, and even funding. His girlfriend met him after he stopped competing. She played volleyball but not at the same level. During a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" saying there aren't many people in it and that it's easier than real sports like soccer. The guy took offense and broke up with her. His friends said he was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, what's the key here? The issue is whether the breakup was justified. The author's dedication and pride in his sport were attacked. Trampolining being called not a real sport could be seen as a devaluation of his hard work. However, some might argue that taking offense to such a comment is overreacting, especially leading to a breakup. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that this comment attacked his identity and achievements. The girlfriend's friends might not see the comment as significant, but for someone who invested so much into a sport, it's a big deal. The line between a personal slight and overreaction is subjective. \n\nI need to consider if the comment was a valid criticism or a personal attack. The girlfriend's statement that trampolining isn't a real sport and comparing it to soccer as more difficult might come off as dismissive. The author's reaction could be seen as protecting his self-worth tied to his sport. However, breaking up over a single conversation might be seen as too drastic. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friends' reactions suggest they think it's a minor issue. But the author's friends (or his own perspective) might see it differently. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was proportionate. Breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as extreme. However, if the comment deeply affected his sense of self, it's a more complex situation. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate opinion or a personal attack. The author's reaction was immediate, which could imply that the comment was a deal-breaker for him. However, relationships require communication and handling disagreements. Maybe the author should have discussed his feelings instead of ending things abruptly. \n\nBut considering the context, the author's sport was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend's comment might have invalidated his achievements. The author could argue that it's about respect for his dedication. However, others might see it as taking it too personally. \n\nIn the end, the answer is subjective. But based on typical AITA responses, people often side with the person who feels disrespected, especially when it's about their core values. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But others might think he overreacted. However, given the circumstances, I'm leaning towards B (the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
