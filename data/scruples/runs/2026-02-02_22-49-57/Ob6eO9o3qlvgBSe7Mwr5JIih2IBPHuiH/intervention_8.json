Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated a lot of time and effort to trampolining, reaching a high level, and it's a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend dismissed the sport, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easier than real sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up with her.\n\nNow, considering the context: the sport's status. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a legitimate sport. The author's dedication and achievements are real. The girlfriend's comment might stem from a lack of understanding or a bias towards more popular sports. Her friends called the author an asshole, but maybe that's because they don't see the depth of his commitment.\n\nIs the author wrong for breaking up? Well, relationships require respect for each other's values and achievements. If one partner's accomplishments are belittled, that can be a deal-breaker. The author's reaction was immediate, which might seem harsh, but the comment could have been a symptom of deeper disrespect. However, breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as overreacting by some. But given the emotional weight of the issue, others might empathize with the author.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's comment was a one-time joke, not a reflection of her true feelings. But the author's dedication is part of his identity, so having that dismissed is a big deal. The key here is mutual respect. If she can't respect his passion, is that a deal-breaker? Different people have different thresholds for what's acceptable.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful towards his significant achievements and identity. The author had every right to feel disrespected and make a choice based on that.\n"
