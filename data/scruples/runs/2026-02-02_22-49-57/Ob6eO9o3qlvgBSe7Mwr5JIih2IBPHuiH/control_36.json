Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, even got funding, and it's part of his identity. His GF made a dismissive comment about his sport, implying it's not as valid as others like soccer. He took it as an attack and broke up immediately. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, to decide if he's in the wrong. Relationships often involve navigating differences in opinions. The GF's comment was hurtful, but does that justify breaking up? Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized. Her dismissal might be ignorant. However, reacting by dumping her seems extreme. Maybe the comment was a deal-breaker because it hit a personal nerve, but is that fair?\n\nThe guy's identity is tied to his sport, so her comment might feel like a personal attack. But should he have addressed it instead of just breaking up? The key is whether his reaction was proportionate. The GF's friends think it's too much, which suggests that in their view, the comment wasn't a valid reason to end the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if his sport is a core part of his identity and she devalued it, that's a significant issue. But maybe he could have discussed his feelings rather than ending things immediately. The question is whether the response was appropriate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of dumping her right away, maybe he should have expressed how her words hurt and discussed it. But if the comment reflected a deeper disrespect or inability to appreciate his efforts, maybe it's a red flag. However, the decision to break up over one comment might be impulsive, even if justified in the moment. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment was a direct attack on his identity and achievements. But others might see it as overreacting. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was proportionate. Since the sport is a core part of his identity and the GF dismissed it, maybe he's justified. But the sudden breakup could be seen as extreme. \n\nI think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because while her comment was hurtful, breaking up immediately over it is extreme. He should have addressed the issue, given her a chance to explain or apologize. The friends' opinions also suggest that the reaction was too harsh. So, the author's response was disproportionate, making him in the wrong.\n"
