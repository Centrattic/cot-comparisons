Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to a sport, training extensively, and was a national-level athlete. That's a huge commitment. When his girlfriend dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, it probably hurt deeply. He felt like she was attacking his identity and the effort he put in. Breaking up immediately after that suggests the comment hit a nerve, and maybe it was a deal-breaker for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she was making a joke or a light-hearted comment. She might not have realized how much the sport meant to him. Maybe she didn't intend to invalidate his achievements. The friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, implying that the reaction was too harsh compared to the minor nature of the comment.\n\nBut then, how do you measure the seriousness of an insult? For the author, trampolining isn't just a sport; it's part of his identity. So when someone belittles it, it's a personal attack. Even if others see it as trivial, the emotional impact matters. The relationship's foundation might have been built on mutual respect for each other's passions. If she can't respect his dedication, maybe the relationship had underlying issues.\n\nAlso, considering the author's history of dedication and the injury he sustained, the sport was a significant part of his life. Dismissing it could be seen as dismissing his hard work. The girlfriend's comment might have been a red flag for the author, showing a lack of appreciation for his efforts.\n\nBut is breaking up over a single comment justified? Some might argue that communication could have resolved it. However, if this was a culmination of previous disrespect or if this comment was the final straw, then maybe it's warranted. The author might not have the emotional tolerance for such comments anymore, especially if he's already past his competitive years.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the girlfriend might not have intended harm, but the author felt it was a direct attack on his identity. The breakup might be a result of the comment triggering deeper insecurities or past feelings of being underestimated. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the emotional response is valid to him, even if others see it as overreacting.\n"
