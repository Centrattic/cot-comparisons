Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been really dedicated to it for 12 years, achieved a high level, and then she comments that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's not hard to get good at compared to something like soccer. He dumps her on the spot, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From his perspective, this sport was a huge part of his identity. He invested a lot of time, effort, and even got funding. Being told that his sport isn't real might feel like a personal attack on his dedication and achievements. That must be really hurtful. He might feel that her comment undermines all his hard work.\n\nOn her side, she might not have realized the depth of his feelings about the sport. Maybe she was just making a joke or a casual remark without intending to belittle him. She might not see trampolining as a \"real\" sport because it's less mainstream or less widely recognized compared to soccer. People sometimes do compare sports they're more familiar with, not understanding the nuances of others. Her friends also think he's being too harsh, which suggests that in her social circle, her comment isn't seen as a big deal.\n\nNow, the key question is whether her comment was a valid reason to break up. Relationships often require communication and understanding. If he felt that her comment was a deal-breaker because it attacked his identity, maybe there were underlying issues. But if he didn't address the issue earlier, maybe he should have had a conversation to explain how he feels about his sport before taking such a drastic step. Dumping someone immediately over a single comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as extreme. It's possible she didn't mean it the way he took it, and a discussion could have clarified things.\n\nAlso, considering that her friends are on her side, maybe there's a cultural or social context where trampolining isn't valued the same way. However, the fact that he was at an international level with funding suggests that it's a legitimate sport in their country, even if it's niche. Her dismissal could be a sign of not respecting his achievements, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nBut then again, people have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport. Her comment might be based on her own biases without understanding the rigor involved. If he took it as an attack on his identity and couldn't reconcile that, it's understandable why he felt the relationship was over. However, breaking up immediately without discussing it might come off as abrupt and not allowing for her to apologize or explain.\n\nIn summary, the author's reaction is based on deep personal values and identity. The girlfriend's comment, while hurtful, might not have been intended as it was received. The author might be in the right if the comment was a deal-breaker for him, but the immediate breakup without communication could be seen as hasty. On the other hand, if her comment was a symptom of a larger lack of respect for his achievements, then leaving might be justified. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because the comment did touch on something very personal and important to him, but the way he handled it could be questioned.\n"
