Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer dedicated 12 years to a sport that's not widely recognized as a \"real sport\" in some people's eyes. They were at a high level, even representing Canada. The comment from the girlfriend minimizing his achievement clearly struck a nerve because it touched on his identity and hard work. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easier than soccer seems dismissive. For someone who's put in thousands of hours and sacrificed a lot, that's a direct attack on their dedication. The reaction of breaking up might seem extreme, but it's not without reason. People often have emotional responses when their core values or achievements are belittled.\n\nHowever, others might argue that the comment was a minor jab and not meant seriously. The friends of the girlfriend think the breakup was overreacting. But the writer's perspective is that this wasn't just about the sport\u2014it was about being devalued. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The writer's feelings are valid. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, but the question is whether the response was proportionate. Relationships require communication and understanding. If the writer felt this was a deal-breaker, maybe they should have addressed it earlier. But given the emotional weight, it's understandable. \n\nI think the key here is that the writer's dedication to their sport is a significant part of their identity. The girlfriend's remark was an attack on that identity. While breaking up over it might seem harsh, the writer's reaction is justified based on their personal feelings and the value they place on their achievements. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
