Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author put a lot of time and effort into trampolining, which is a significant part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismissed it as not a \"real sport,\" it felt like a personal attack. That's a big deal because people's passions and achievements can be deeply tied to their self-worth.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might have been a joke or a momentary lapse in judgment. She might not have realized how important the sport was to him. Her friends called the breakup overkill, which suggests that others see it as an overreaction. But the key here is intent versus impact. Even if her intention wasn't malicious, the impact of her words hurt him deeply.\n\nRelationships require communication and respect. If the author had addressed the comment earlier or discussed how he felt about his sport, maybe the situation could have been resolved without a breakup. However, the comment directly invalidated his years of dedication, which is a valid hurt. \n\nBut dumping someone over a single comment, even if it's a big issue for you, can seem extreme. It's possible he didn't give her a chance to apologize or explain. Still, considering the emotional weight of the issue for him, it's not clear-cut. The answer depends on whether respecting someone's passion is a deal-breaker. \n\nIn the end, while breaking up over one comment might be seen as hasty, the girlfriend's words were disrespectful towards a core part of his identity. So the author's decision, though extreme, might be understandable from his perspective. But others might argue that it's not worth losing a relationship over. The answer hinges on balancing the validity of his feelings against the potential for resolution.\n"
