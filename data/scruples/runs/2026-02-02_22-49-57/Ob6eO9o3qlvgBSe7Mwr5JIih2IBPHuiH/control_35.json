Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, achieved national and international competition levels, and it's a huge part of his identity. His girlfriend made a comment downplaying the sport's legitimacy and effort. He took it as an attack on his identity and dumped her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was wrong. The factors to consider are the severity of the comment and the appropriateness of the response. The girlfriend's statement seems dismissive of his dedication and achievements. For someone who invested so much time and effort, that comment could be a deep personal wound. \n\nHowever, relationships require communication and conflict resolution. Ending the relationship immediately after such a comment might be seen as impulsive. But, if this comment triggered past insecurities or repeated issues, maybe it's a breaking point. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole, but their perspective might not account for the emotional impact. The key is whether the reaction is proportionate. The author felt attacked, and given the sport's significance to him, the reaction might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing and not malicious. But the author's history with the sport and how others have dismissed it before could make this a tipping point. \n\nSo, considering the emotional impact and the fact that the comment targeted a core part of his identity, the author's reaction, while harsh, might not be entirely wrong. The answer might be B (No), as the comment was personal and the breakup was a result of a significant emotional trigger.\n"
