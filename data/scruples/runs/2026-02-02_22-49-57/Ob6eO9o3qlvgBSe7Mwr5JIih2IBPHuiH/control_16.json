Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, and it was a huge part of his identity. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She had played volleyball in high school but not at a high level. When discussing sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real\" sport, suggesting it's easy compared to something like soccer. The man felt attacked and broke up with her on the spot. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting, and he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: his dedication and pride in his sport, her belittling his achievement, his emotional reaction leading to breaking up, and others' opinions that he overreacted.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From his perspective, trampolining was a significant part of his life, and her comments could feel like a personal attack on his identity and hard work. That kind of dismissal might be hurtful, especially if he's already faced similar sentiments before. On her side, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to him. She might have made a casual comment, thinking it was a joke or a light-hearted remark, not intending to undermine his achievements.\n\nHowever, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Breaking up over a single conversation might seem extreme to some. If the issue was about her not valuing his passion, which is a valid concern in a relationship, then maybe he's justified. But if the breakup was immediate without discussion or attempts to resolve the issue, that might be seen as impulsive. Also, the fact that her friends called him an asshole suggests that society might view his reaction as disproportionate.\n\nBut then again, when someone's core identity is dismissed, that's a big deal. It's possible that this incident revealed deeper issues in the relationship where she wasn't respecting his values. If he felt that her attitude was incompatible with his values, then breaking up might be necessary.\n\nI should also consider the nature of the comment. Calling trampolining not a real sport and implying it's easier than other sports could be seen as a lack of respect. If he had built his identity around that sport, her remarks could have triggered feelings of inadequacy or being undervalued. In that case, his reaction, while abrupt, might be understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have addressed her comment calmly, explaining how it hurt him instead of immediately ending the relationship. Relationships require communication, and jumping to breaking up without discussing might be seen as immature.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If her comment was a one-time thing and he's overreacting, then yes. But if her attitude was part of a larger pattern of disrespect, maybe not. The scenario doesn't mention prior issues, so it's hard to tell. The fact that her friends said he was an asshole indicates that society might not support his decision, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent vs. impact. Her intent might have been to make a joke, but the impact was hurtful. He had the right to feel wronged, but reacting with a breakup might be too drastic. However, if the relationship had underlying issues, maybe it's justified. Without more context, it's a tough call. But given the information, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong because the comment was about his deep-seated passion, and his reaction was based on feeling disrespected. So, answer B (No) might be appropriate here.\n"
