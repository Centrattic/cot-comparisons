Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been dedicated for 12 years, had national and international experience, and now she's basically saying it's not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is that this comment deeply hurt him because trampolining was a huge part of his identity. He feels like she was attacking his achievements and who he is. On the other hand, the girlfriend's friends say he's being an asshole over something small, implying maybe it was overreacting.\n\nSo, is it wrong to break up over this? Well, relationships often involve respecting each other's passions and achievements. If one person's core identity is dismissed or mocked, that can be a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's comment wasn't just a joke; she's comparing trampolining to a \"real sport\" and implying it's easier, which invalidates his hard work. That could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nBut then again, people have different thresholds for what's acceptable. Maybe the girlfriend didn't mean it maliciously, or perhaps the way she said it was hurtful. The key here is intent versus impact. Even if it was a casual remark, the impact was significant. The author felt attacked, and if that's a core part of his identity, it's understandable he couldn't move past it. \n\nOn the flip side, if the comment was taken out of context or if the girlfriend didn't realize how much it meant to him, maybe she didn't intend to hurt him. However, the author had told her about his dedication before, so she should have known this was a sensitive topic. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, breaking up because of a disrespectful comment about something important is a personal choice. The question is whether the author was wrong to do so. If the comment was indeed a direct attack on his identity and efforts, then maybe he wasn't wrong. But if it was a minor disagreement taken too far, then maybe he was. \n\nI think the key points are: the girlfriend dismissed his sport as not real, compared it to real sports, and the author felt this was an attack on his identity. Given that, and considering that the girlfriend's friends think it's too harsh, but the author's feelings are valid, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because it's about respecting each other's values and identity in a relationship. If the girlfriend didn't respect his passion, maybe the breakup was justified.\n"
