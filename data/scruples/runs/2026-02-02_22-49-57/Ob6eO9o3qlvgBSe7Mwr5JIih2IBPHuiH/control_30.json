Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who was a high-level trampolining athlete, broke up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a \"real sport\" and implied it wasn't as hard as other sports like soccer. The author took it very personally and ended the relationship immediately. Now, the question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author invested a lot of time and effort into his sport, which was a significant part of his identity. Being told that his sport isn't real could feel like a personal attack, especially if others have dismissed it before. But, on the other hand, relationships require communication and mutual respect. Could there have been a better way to handle the situation?\n\nThe girlfriend's comment was dismissive and possibly judgmental. She compared trampolining to a \"real sport\" like soccer, implying that it's easier to excel in. That's a bit of a stereotype; some might argue that all sports require dedication, and calling one not real is invalidating. The author felt attacked, which is understandable given the importance of the sport to him. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as an overreaction, even if the comment was hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends said the author was an asshole for breaking up over something small. This suggests that some people might think the issue wasn't worth ending the relationship over. But others might support the author if they feel the comment was a fundamental disrespect to his identity and achievements.\n\nI should also consider if the author had prior discussions about respecting his sport. If the girlfriend had a history of belittling his passions, maybe the breakup was justified. But if this was a one-time comment, maybe there's room for dialogue. However, the author mentions that people have been saying similar things his whole life, so this might have been the last straw.\n\nIn relationships, how partners handle disagreements is important. Reacting with immediate breakup could indicate impulsiveness rather than a considered decision. But if the comment struck a nerve that was long-standing and deeply personal, maybe it's a valid reason to end things.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a complex case. While the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the immediate breakup might be seen as extreme. However, if the author felt that his core self was attacked and couldn't reconcile that, maybe it's not wrong. The key is whether the action of breaking up is proportionate to the offense. The girlfriend's friends think it's too harsh, which might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But others might empathize with his hurt feelings. I'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because relationships often require working through such issues rather than immediate breakup, unless the issue is a dealbreaker. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) if the comment was a direct attack on his identity and he couldn't move past it.\n"
