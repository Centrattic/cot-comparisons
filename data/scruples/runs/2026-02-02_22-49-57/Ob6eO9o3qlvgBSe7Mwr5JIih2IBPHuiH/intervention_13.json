Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has dedicated a lot of time to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, and it's a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend dismissed the sport as not being \"real\" and implied it's easier than other sports like soccer. That's a pretty direct and hurtful jab at his dedication and achievements.\n\nThe author felt that this comment attacked who he is, given the years of commitment and effort. Emotional reactions to such comments can be strong, especially if the sport is central to one's self-worth. Breaking up immediately might seem drastic, but in the context of feeling disrespected, maybe not entirely out of line. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the reason for the breakup is too trivial. The girlfriend might not have intended it as a personal attack, or maybe she was just being dismissive without realizing the depth of his feelings. However, the author's perspective is that this was a deal-breaker because it struck at his core identity. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole for breaking up over \"something so small.\" But the author perceives it as a major issue because of its personal significance. It's a clash between personal values and what one considers disrespectful versus what others see as overreacting.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. If one partner undermines the other's passions or achievements, it can lead to serious issues. The author's reaction might be seen as justified if he felt disrespected and couldn't reconcile that with staying in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The dismissal of a significant part of his identity and the hurt caused by her comments justify his decision, even if others see it as an overreaction.\n"
