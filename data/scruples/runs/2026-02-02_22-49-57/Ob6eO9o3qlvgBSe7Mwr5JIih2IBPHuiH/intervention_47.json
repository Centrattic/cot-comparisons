Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up a relationship because the girlfriend made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, and took it very seriously. When discussing sports, the girlfriend downplayed trampolining as not a real sport, suggesting it's less prestigious than something like soccer. The author took this as a personal attack and broke up immediately. His friends think he was too harsh, but he feels validated.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the girlfriend's comment cross a line that justified the breakup? Is the author in the wrong for taking it so personally?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, trampolining is a huge part of his identity. He invested a lot of time and effort, even getting funding. Her comments might have felt like a dismissal of his hard work and achievements. Publicly devaluing someone's passion can be hurtful. People often take personal attacks on their interests or accomplishments as attacks on themselves. So, if the comment was made in a dismissive or mocking tone, it's reasonable for him to feel that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended to belittle him. She could have been making a joke or not realizing the depth of his commitment. However, in the conversation, she says trampolining isn't a real sport and implies it's easier than soccer, which might be seen as lacking respect for his dedication. Even if it was a joke, if it's hurtful and triggers a breakup, the question is whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nThe friends say it's too small an issue, but that's subjective. What's minor to some can be significant to others. The author's reaction hinges on how much the sport is tied to his self-worth. If the relationship couldn't handle such a personal issue, maybe the breakup is a result of deeper incompatibilities.\n\nBut was the breakup justified? It's a tough call. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, but breaking up over a single conversation might be extreme unless it's part of a pattern. However, if the comment was a dealbreaker for the author because it touched on his core identity, then he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship over it. People have different thresholds for what they can tolerate. The key is whether the author acted in a way that's reasonable given his values and the relationship's context.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he stood up for something that's very important to him. If the girlfriend wasn't supportive of his passion, maybe the breakup was necessary for him to be with someone who respects his background. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
