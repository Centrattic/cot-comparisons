Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author spent 12 years training in trampolining, competing nationally and internationally, and even got funding. That's a huge commitment. Then, after an injury, he met his girlfriend. She had some sports background but not as intense. During a conversation, she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real\" sport, implying it's easier than others like soccer. The author felt attacked and ended the relationship immediately. His friends are saying he was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are the value of dedication, the personal significance of the sport, and the girlfriend's dismissive comment. The author felt that her comment was a personal attack on his identity because the sport was such a big part of his life. \n\nOn one hand, breaking up over a single comment might seem extreme. People often have different opinions about sports and their validity. However, the comment wasn't just a casual joke; it was a direct dismissal of his effort and achievements. The girlfriend compared his sport to soccer, suggesting that if he had chosen a more popular sport, he wouldn't have been as good. That could be seen as undermining his accomplishments.\n\nThe friends said it was over a small thing, but for the author, it wasn't small. It was about respect for his identity and the years he invested. The question is whether the reaction was justified. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the comment was a direct attack on something he cares deeply about. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner doesn't respect the other's passions or achievements, it can be a deal-breaker. However, some might argue that a single conversation isn't a reason to end a relationship. But given the emotional impact and the significance of the sport to him, his reaction is understandable. \n\nAlso, her friends' reactions might not fully grasp the emotional weight of the situation. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
