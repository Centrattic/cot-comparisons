Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, achieved national and international competition levels, and it had a significant impact on his identity. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport\" and suggested he couldn't have been good at a real sport like soccer. This led to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are the value of the sport to the author's identity and the girlfriend's dismissive comment. Trampolining is a recognized Olympic sport, so calling it not real might be a misunderstanding. The girlfriend's volleyball background doesn't diminish her experience, but her comment could be seen as undermining the author's dedication and achievements.\n\nThe author's reaction is immediate\u2014dumping her on the spot. While the comment was hurtful, the question is whether the reaction was proportionate. Breaking up over a single conversation where someone makes a dismissive remark could be seen as extreme. However, if the comment deeply insulted a core part of the author's identity and there was no prior history of similar issues, it might be justified as protecting self-worth.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted. Relationships should be able to handle such disagreements without ending. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, which adds another layer. But the author's emotional response is valid given the personal significance of the sport.\n\nThe debate here is between respecting personal identity versus the severity of the reaction. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's comment was a legitimate criticism or an attack, and if the breakup was a necessary boundary or an overreaction.\n"
