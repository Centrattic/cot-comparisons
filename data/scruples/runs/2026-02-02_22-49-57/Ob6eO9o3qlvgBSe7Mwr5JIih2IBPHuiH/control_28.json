Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. After ending his career due to injury, he meets his girlfriend. She initially seemed to respect his background, but during a conversation about sports, she implied that trampolining isn't a real sport and suggested that if he played a \"real\" sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. The author took this as a personal attack, leading him to break up immediately. His girlfriend's friends and others think he was too harsh, but he feels justified because the sport was so important to him.\n\nNow, to evaluate if he's in the wrong. Breaking up over something like this is a big decision. The key factors here are the context of their relationship, the nature of the comment, and whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment was dismissive and belittling. She's undermining his dedication and achievements by calling it not a \"real\" sport and implying it's easier than other sports. For someone who put in so much time and effort, such a comment can feel like a personal attack on their hard work and identity. The author's reaction is based on feeling disrespected in a core part of his life.\n\nHowever, dumping someone immediately over a single conversation might be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe he could have expressed his hurt feelings and discussed the issue rather than ending things abruptly. But the girlfriend's friends and others might argue that the comment was a deal-breaker because it showed a lack of respect and understanding of his dedication.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that calling a sport \"not real\" is a form of disrespect that's hard to forgive, especially when it's a central part of someone's identity. The author's reaction is about defending his self-worth. But is breaking up the right response? It's possible that a more constructive approach could have resolved the issue or led to a mutual understanding.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over \"something small,\" but to him, it's a significant issue. The question is whether the comment was a valid reason to end the relationship. If the girlfriend had a pattern of dismissing his achievements or not respecting his past, then the breakup makes sense. But if this was an isolated incident, maybe he overreacted.\n\nIn summary, the author's reaction stems from feeling disrespected in a key area of his life. The girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive. However, the immediate breakup without discussion might be seen as extreme. But given the emotional weight of the issue for him, it's also understandable. The answer hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate deal-breaker or an overreaction.\n"
