Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level national athlete in trampolining for 12 years, trained 30 hours a week, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. He quit due to a head injury. The girlfriend met him after he stopped competing. She made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying that it's less valid than others like soccer, and that it's not hard to get good at. The author took this as an attack on his identity and effort, leading him to dump her immediately. Her friends said he was an asshole for breaking up over something small, but he feels hurt by the lifelong comments he's heard about his sport.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was deeply committed to his sport, which was a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and belittling, suggesting that his achievements weren't real or as valid as other sports. The author felt attacked and decided to end the relationship on the spot, which her friends consider overreacting.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The question is about whether the breakup was justified. The girlfriend's comment was clearly disrespectful, especially given the author's dedication. However, the friends might argue that it's a minor issue to break up over, but others might see it as a valid response to a hurtful remark about a core part of his identity.\n\nFactors to consider: The girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his passion and achievements. The author's reaction was immediate and based on the emotional impact of the comment. Whether the comment was a one-time thing or part of a pattern. Also, the context of their relationship and how important the sport is to him.\n\nIn relationships, respect is crucial. If one partner consistently undermines the other's passions or achievements, that can be a major red flag. The author's sport was a huge part of his life and identity, so a comment that devalues that could be seen as disrespectful. However, breaking up on the spot might be seen as extreme if it's a single incident. But considering the emotional weight, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, which is a common reaction, but maybe they don't see the deeper context. The author's perspective is that the comment wasn't just about the sport but about his dedication and who he is. The girlfriend's comment might not have been intended to be hurtful, but the way the author perceived it and the impact on their relationship matters.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was proportionate and if there's a pattern. If it's a one-time comment and the author immediately dumps her, some might say it's overreacting. But if the comment was a culmination of previous disrespect towards his sport, then it's a bigger issue. The post doesn't mention prior incidents, just this one. So the friends' perspective is that it's a small thing. However, the author feels it's a significant attack on his identity.\n\nI think the answer would depend on the importance of the sport to the author and whether the girlfriend's comment was a deal-breaker. The author's reaction might be seen as justified if the comment was part of a broader pattern or if the sport is a core part of his identity. Since the comment was about the validity of his sport, which he took as an attack, and he chose to end the relationship, the answer could be B (No), because the author's feelings about his sport and identity are valid, and a relationship should be built on mutual respect. However, some might argue that breaking up over a single comment is too harsh, but given the context, it's a matter of perspective.\n"
