Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called his sport, trampolining, not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The man dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, got funding, and it was a huge part of his identity. His girlfriend met him after he stopped competing. She played volleyball in high school. During a conversation about sports, she dismissed his sport as not real, comparing it to a sport like soccer where he wouldn't be as good. He took it as an attack on his identity and dumped her immediately. His friends said he's an asshole for overreacting, but he feels his dedication was disrespected.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Breaking up over this might seem extreme to some, especially because the girlfriend's comment, while hurtful, could be seen as a joke or a lack of understanding. However, the man's sport was integral to his identity, and the comment felt like a personal attack.\n\nI need to weigh the validity of his reaction. On one hand, taking a relationship seriously and valuing mutual respect is important. If a partner undermines a core part of your identity, that's a significant issue. On the other hand, maybe the girlfriend didn't mean it as an attack, and the breakup was too hasty. But given the context of his deep commitment and the emotional impact, maybe his reaction was justified. The friends' reactions might be short-sighted, not understanding how important the sport was to him. So the answer might depend on whether the comment was a deal-breaker in terms of respect and mutual understanding in the relationship.\n\nI think the key points are: the girlfriend's comment minimized his achievements, he took it as a personal attack, and he acted immediately. If the comment was a one-time thing and not a pattern of disrespect, maybe splitting was hasty. But if respecting each other's passions and identities is crucial, then her dismissal was a red flag. So the author might not be in the wrong if the comment revealed a fundamental disrespect for his core identity. Alternatively, maybe he could have addressed it more calmly. Hmm.\n"
