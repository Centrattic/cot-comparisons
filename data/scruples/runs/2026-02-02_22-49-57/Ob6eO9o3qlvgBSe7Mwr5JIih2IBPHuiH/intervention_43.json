Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend, who met him after he stopped competing, made a comment downplaying his sport, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easy compared to others like soccer. The author felt attacked and dumped her immediately. The friends thought the author was an a**hole for breaking up over something small.\n\nSo, the key points here are the value of the sport and the emotional response. Trampolining is part of the author's identity, and the girlfriend's comments seem dismissive. The question is whether the author was justified in ending the relationship over this.\n\nI should consider if the girlfriend's comments were a deal-breaker. Disrespecting someone's passion, especially one they've invested a lot into, can be hurtful. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as overreacting. But given the emotional weight the author attached to his sport, maybe it's valid. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends called it small, but to the author, it was a big deal. The decision to break up because of feeling disrespected in a core part of his identity could be seen as justified. On the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the comment first instead of immediate breakup. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the comment was a direct attack on his identity and he felt it was disrespectful, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that the reaction is too harsh. But considering the depth of his investment in the sport, it's not trivial to him. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
