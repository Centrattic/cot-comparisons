Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, and even got funding. He quit due to an injury. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She played volleyball in high school. During a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, implying that it's less valid or less challenging than other sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up with her immediately. His friends and others say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, evaluating the rightness or wrongness. The key points here are the significance of the sport to the author's identity and the girlfriend's dismissive comments. The author had invested a huge amount of time and effort into trampolining, which is a big part of his life. The girlfriend's comments might have been a joke or a casual remark, but they clearly hit a nerve. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it's considered a real sport. However, the girlfriend's argument was that it's less popular and perhaps easier to get to a high level compared to something like soccer. Whether that's true is debatable. But the main issue here is not about the validity of the sport from an objective standpoint but how the comment was perceived by the author.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up over this is excessive. The author felt that the comment attacked his dedication and identity. The girlfriend might not have realized how much the sport meant to him. On the other hand, the author might have overreacted by ending the relationship immediately over a potentially flippant comment. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of an immediate breakup, discussing the hurt feelings might have been a better approach. The girlfriend's friends also think he's in the wrong, suggesting that breaking up over this is too harsh. However, the author felt deeply hurt, so it's not entirely his fault. The problem is balancing the value of the relationship against the hurt caused. \n\nSo, the author's action was a direct response to feeling attacked, but the appropriateness of the response is questionable. The girlfriend's comment, while potentially dismissive, might not warrant an immediate breakup. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
