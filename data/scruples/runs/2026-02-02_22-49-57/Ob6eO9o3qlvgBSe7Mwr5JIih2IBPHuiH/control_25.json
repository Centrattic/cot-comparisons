Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up a girlfriend because she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author put a lot of effort into trampolining, which is part of their identity. The girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implied that achieving high in it isn't as hard as other sports. The author took this as a personal attack and ended the relationship immediately. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She might not have intended to invalidate his achievements. Maybe she was being dismissive without realizing the emotional weight behind it. But her statement could be seen as undermining his dedication. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships often require communication and understanding. If the author felt that his passion was being belittled, breaking up might seem extreme to some, but others might see it as standing up for self-respect. The friends said the author was an asshole, but that's not always the case. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so saying it's not real might be incorrect. The girlfriend's comment could stem from a lack of knowledge about the sport's legitimacy. The author's reaction might be justified if this was a recurring issue, but if it was an offhand comment, maybe overreacting.\n\nHowever, breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, can seem impulsive. But given the importance of the sport to the author's identity, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the girlfriend's words were a one-time joke or part of a pattern. The post suggests it was a one-time thing, which might make the author's reaction harsh. But on the other hand, it's about respecting each other's values. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author overreacted. But considering the deep personal connection to the sport, maybe not in the wrong. However, the immediate breakup without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. The friends' opinions are mixed, but maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with nuances. Alternatively, maybe A if the reaction was too harsh. But I'm leaning towards B because the comment was a direct attack on his identity and achievements, which are valid to be upset about.\n"
