Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 12 years and significant time and effort. After an injury, they stopped competing. They met their girlfriend after that, who they felt supported their passion. Then, during a conversation about sports, the girlfriend dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, implying it's less valid than sports like soccer. The author took it as a personal attack and broke up immediately. The friends of the girlfriend said the author is an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo the core issue is whether breaking up over this comment was justified. The key points to consider: the value of the sport to the author's identity, the girlfriend's intent, the proportionality of the reaction, and whether the comment was a deal-breaker.\n\nThe author's dedication to trampolining is clear. It's a big part of their identity, and they achieved national and international recognition. For someone who has invested so much, a comment dismissing their sport as not \"real\" can feel like a dismissal of their achievements and self-worth. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not have meant it maliciously. She could have been making a general statement, perhaps influenced by common perceptions where some people downplay less mainstream sports. However, her comment did cross a line by belittling the author's significant accomplishments.\n\nNow, is breaking up over this in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and support. If a partner consistently undermines a core part of your identity, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's statement wasn't just a casual joke but a direct dismissal of the author's sport and by extension their hard work. While the author could have responded with a conversation instead of an immediate breakup, the emotional impact of the comment might have been too much. However, reacting with an immediate breakup might be seen as impulsive. The key is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. On one hand, the comment was a significant personal attack. On the other, ending a relationship over a single comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as extreme.\n\nBut considering the context: the sport is a huge part of the author's life, and the girlfriend's friends didn't support the author's side, which might indicate that the girlfriend's initial comment wasn't an isolated incident but possibly part of a pattern. If the girlfriend didn't respect the author's passion, it could lead to more issues down the line. The author might have felt that the relationship wasn't sustainable if their partner couldn't respect their history and identity. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the action was a proportionate response to the situation. Here, while the breakup might seem harsh, the underlying issue of disrespect for a core part of the author's identity is significant. If the girlfriend had continued to belittle the author's achievements, it could have led to ongoing resentment. The immediate breakup could be seen as an attempt to end a relationship that's not respectful, rather than an overreaction. So, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
