Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her joking about his sport, trampolining, as not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to a high-level athletic career in a niche sport, which is significant. His identity and self-worth are tied to this dedication. When his girlfriend dismisses the sport, it's not just a joke but a direct attack on something he values deeply. That's a big deal because it undermines his achievements and the effort he put in.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended it as a serious attack. She could have been making a light-hearted comment, not realizing how much it would hurt him. People often don't consider how their words affect others, especially if they haven't shared the same level of commitment to a sport.\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate: he dumped her. While the issue is about a sport, the core is about respect and validation. If someone mocks your passion, especially one that's a major part of your identity, it's a significant emotional issue. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, but maybe they don't understand the depth of the relationship issues. \n\nBut here's the thing: relationships require communication. Maybe the author could have discussed his feelings earlier, rather than letting it build up. However, in this case, the comment triggered a long-standing issue where he felt his sport wasn't respected. The fact that he had funding and international competition shows his legitimacy in the sport. Her dismissal might have felt like a personal attack, and breaking up was a way to protect his self-esteem.\n\nAlso, considering that the girlfriend played volleyball, which is more mainstream, she might not grasp the nuances of trampolining's competitiveness. Her comparison to soccer is unfair, as trampolining has its own challenges and global recognition. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's decision was extreme, but the context matters. If the comment was a one-time joke without prior disrespect, maybe the reaction is overblown. But if this was the culmination of feeling unappreciated, it's a valid response. The key is whether the comment was malicious or a misunderstanding. The author might be in the right if the girlfriend didn't respect his passion, but the sudden breakup without discussion could be seen as hasty. However, given the emotional impact, it's a justified reaction for him. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on intent and emotional significance. The author isn't in the wrong because his feelings were hurt by a personal attack on his achievements. The girlfriend's friends might not see it that way, but the author's perspective is valid in this context.\n"
