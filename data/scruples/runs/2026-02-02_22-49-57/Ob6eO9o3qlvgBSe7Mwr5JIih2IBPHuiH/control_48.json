Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been really dedicated to it for 12 years, had high-level achievements, and she dismissed it by saying it's not a real sport. He took it as an attack on who he is and left immediately. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. His perspective is that this comment was a deep personal insult, given the time and effort he invested. To him, trampolining is a significant part of his identity, and her belittling it could feel like invalidating all his hard work and accomplishments. He might see the breakup as justified because it touched on something core to his self-worth.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that she called trampolining not a real sport. That could be seen as a flippant or dismissive remark, but maybe she didn't mean it maliciously. People sometimes make jokes or offhand comments without realizing the impact. However, if he took it seriously and it caused a huge emotional reaction, it's possible she didn't intend to be hurtful. Her friends' reactions suggest they think the breakup was over the top, implying maybe she wasn't fully aware of how important the sport was to him.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, is a big decision. The question is whether her comment was a deal-breaker or a minor issue. He might argue that it was a fundamental disrespect, but others might say that breaking up immediately is too extreme. The fact that she had a different viewpoint on sports and made a critical comment could be a communication issue rather than a moral failing. However, his reaction is a personal choice; he might feel that his identity was attacked, so he's acting on his emotional response.\n\nThe key points here are the validity of his feelings vs. the appropriateness of the response. If he felt that her comment was a personal attack and couldn't reconcile that, then maybe it's not his fault. But if he could have addressed it with more dialogue instead of a breakup, some might argue that he's being too harsh. However, given the depth of his dedication and the personal nature of the criticism, his reaction is understandable from his perspective. \n\nI need to decide if his reaction was unjustified. The girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over \"something small,\" but to him, it wasn't small. It's about respect and validation. So, there's a conflict here between personal feelings and the other person's intent. The answer hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate cause for breaking up. If the comment was a major disrespect, then he's justified. If it was an offhand joke, maybe overreacting. But since he took it as a personal attack on his identity, it's not his fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
