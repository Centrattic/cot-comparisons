Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 12 years and significant hours to training. He was even funded and part of Team Canada. After retiring due to injury, he met his girlfriend, who initially thought his sport was cool. During a conversation about sports, she downplayed trampolining, calling it not a \"real sport\" and implying it's easier compared to something like soccer. The author took this as a personal attack and ended the relationship immediately. Her friends and others think he's being too harsh over a minor issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether he was right to break up over this. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer should be A or B. \n\nTo analyze, I should consider the following points:\n\n1. **Context of the Relationship**: They met after he stopped competing, so it's possible she didn't realize the depth of his commitment and achievements. However, he mentioned she had heard a lot about his sport and found it cool. So she knew about it and had shown some interest.\n\n2. **The Argument**: Her comment was dismissive, suggesting trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at something more popular like soccer. This could be seen as belittling his dedication and accomplishments.\n\n3. **Reaction of the Author**: He dumped her on the spot. The immediacy and finality of the breakup might be a point of contention. Was this a justified response given the emotional weight he attached to the sport?\n\n4. **Others' Opinions**: Her friends and people in his life think he's an asshole for making a big deal out of it. This might indicate that the reaction is seen as disproportionate by some.\n\n5. **Subjectivity of Sports Value**: Whether trampolining is a \"real sport\" is subjective. It is recognized in the Olympics, so it's legitimate. Her dismissal implies that only certain sports are valid, which could be a personal bias. The author's identity is tied to his sport, so her comment might have felt like a dismissal of his identity.\n\n6. **Communication and Intent**: The girlfriend might not have intended a personal attack but perhaps made a careless comment. However, the author might have felt it was a direct attack on his hard work and achievements.\n\n7. **Dedication and Effort**: The author invested thousands of hours and achieved national/international recognition. Her comment undermines that effort, which is a big deal for someone whose identity is closely linked to their sport.\n\n8. **Alternatives to Breaking Up**: Instead of immediate breakup, maybe he could have discussed how her comment made him feel. But if he felt it was a dealbreaker and couldn't see a way to move past it, then the breakup might be understandable.\n\n9. **Respect and Understanding in Relationships**: Relationships require mutual respect. If one partner's core identity is being disrespected, it's a significant issue. Her friends' reaction might stem from not seeing the importance of the sport in his life, hence considering it trivial.\n\n10. **AITA Posts**: These often depend on the community's perspective. In similar posts, people usually consider the level of commitment and the nature of the disrespect. If the comment was a one-time thing, others might argue for forgiveness. But if it's part of a pattern, the author's decision might be more justified.\n\nIn this case, the girlfriend's comment was a direct dismissal of his achievements and the sport he's passionate about. Given the author's significant investment and the emotional impact, he might feel that such a comment invalidates his entire career. While her friends see it as minor, the author's reaction is based on how it affected him personally. \n\nHowever, breaking up over a single comment without giving her a chance to explain or apologize could be seen as impulsive. But if the comment struck at the core of his self-worth and he couldn't reconcile with her, it's a valid reason. \n\nI think the key is whether the comment was a one-off or part of a larger issue. Since the author says she had always thought it was cool before, this might be the first time she was dismissive. That makes it a problem in their relationship dynamic. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he was standing up for his self-respect and the value of his dedication. But I should also consider that relationships require compromise and that maybe he could have handled it differently. However, given the circumstances, his reaction seems reasonable.\n"
