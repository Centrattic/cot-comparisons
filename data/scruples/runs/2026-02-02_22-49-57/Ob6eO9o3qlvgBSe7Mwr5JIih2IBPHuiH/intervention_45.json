Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national and international athlete, and it was a huge part of his identity. After an injury, he stopped competing. The girlfriend met him after he stopped. She had some sports experience herself. During a conversation about sports, she downgraded trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" implying it's not as hard or respected as others like soccer. The author felt attacked and dumped her immediately. Her friends and others said he was being an asshole for breaking up over something \"small,\" but he feels it was about his identity and dedication.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's deep personal investment in his sport, the girlfriend's dismissive comments, and the immediate breakup. The question is whether the breakup was justified.\n\nFrom one angle, making fun of someone's dedication to a sport, especially one they see as a big part of their identity, could be hurtful. The author might feel disrespected or devalued. Trampolining isn't as mainstream as soccer, but in the context of the author's experience, that's beside the point. The girlfriend's comments might be seen as trivializing his effort and achievements.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that one comment isn't worth ending a relationship over. People can have different opinions about the validity of sports. If the girlfriend didn't realize how much it meant to him, maybe a discussion or clarification could have resolved the issue instead of ending the relationship immediately. The friends might think the reaction was too harsh.\n\nBut then again, if this comment hit a nerve that's been a recurring issue (as he mentions others have dismissed his sport before), it might have been the final straw. The timing of the comment, after he had already stopped competing, could have made it more painful. The author might feel that his identity is being attacked, and cutting it off immediately is a reaction to that deeper hurt.\n\nThe decision here hinges on whether a single dismissive comment justifies a breakup. Some people might say it's too extreme, while others might see it as a justified stand for self-respect. The girlfriend's friends think he's in the wrong, but the author's perspective is about respecting his own values and the importance of mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, how people handle disagreements and respect each other's passions is important. If the girlfriend couldn't respect his dedication to a sport, even if she didn't agree, that could be a deal-breaker. The author's reaction is about preserving his self-worth in the relationship. However, maybe the author could have addressed the comment first before breaking up, but the immediacy might reflect how much it mattered to him.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong because the comment directly attacked his identity and dedication, which were significant to him. The relationship's foundation requires mutual respect, and if that's not present, ending it isn't necessarily the wrong choice.\n"
