Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, achieved national and international competition levels, and had funding. His girlfriend made fun of his sport, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easy compared to others like soccer. He felt this was an attack on his identity and dedication, so he broke up with her. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the girlfriend's comments were dismissive and disrespectful towards his achievements and hard work. She undermined his dedication by implying his sport isn't valid. That's a significant emotional trigger for someone who invested so much into their sport. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require communication and understanding. While her comment was hurtful, was breaking up immediately the right response? Maybe he should have discussed his feelings before ending things. However, the context is that this comment directly attacked his identity and achievements, which are central to who he is. The injury that forced him to quit also adds to the emotional weight here.\n\nTrampolining is a recognized Olympic sport, so calling it not a real sport is factually incorrect, but the issue here is about respect and personal value. The girlfriend's friends might think it's trivial, but for him, it's not. The line between a valid relationship issue and overreacting is thin. \n\nIn relationships, how people handle such issues matters. If one partner's core values or achievements are repeatedly disrespected, it can be a deal-breaker. The author felt it was an attack on his identity, so maybe he's justified. However, breaking up over one comment might be seen as impulsive. But considering the emotional impact and the history of such sentiments he's faced, the reaction could be understandable.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment was a direct attack on his dedication and identity, which he had every right to feel hurt about. The friends' reactions might not fully grasp the depth of that personal impact. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
