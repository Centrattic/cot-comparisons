Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 12 years and a lot of hours to the sport. After retiring due to injury, he met his girlfriend who heard about his achievements. During a conversation about sports, the girlfriend dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, comparing it to soccer, implying it's easier and less respected. The author felt attacked because the sport was a huge part of his identity, leading him to break up immediately. His girlfriend's friends are telling him he's the asshole, but he's unsure if he's in the right.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the girlfriend's comment about the sport being trivial, the author's reaction, and the aftermath. The key issue is whether the author overreacted by breaking up over this comment, which led to the AITA question.\n\nI should consider the value of personal identity and how one's achievements are perceived. The author invested a significant part of his life into trampolining, which is a recognized sport in some contexts (like Olympic trampoline). The girlfriend's dismissal could be seen as invalidating his hard work and dedication. However, the flip side is that people have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real sport,\" and maybe the girlfriend didn't mean to be hurtful, just expressing her own view.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a single comment might be extreme. Even if the comment was hurtful, relationships often require handling conflicts through communication rather than immediate breakup. The friends' reactions suggest that they see the breakup as too harsh. The question is whether the comment was a deal-breaker or a miscommunication that could have been addressed.\n\nAlso, considering the context: the author felt the comment attacked his core identity. That's a big deal. But is it justifiable to end a relationship over this without trying to talk it out? Maybe the girlfriend's friends are right if she didn't realize the depth of his feelings about the sport. Alternatively, if the author felt that the comment reflected a deeper disrespect for his efforts, maybe it was a red flag.\n\nIn terms of AITA dynamics, usually, the community looks at whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The author's justification is about respect for his past and identity, while the girlfriend's side is about her opinion not being malicious. The answer might hinge on whether the breakup was a proportional response to the perceived disrespect.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal attitudes towards certain sports. Trampolining is less mainstream than soccer, so some people might not recognize it as a legitimate sport. However, the author's achievements are significant, so the girlfriend's comment could come across as dismissive of his accomplishments.\n\nIn summary, the author's reaction is understandable given the personal significance of the sport. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on if the breakup was an appropriate response. The girlfriend's friends might think he overreacted, but others might side with him if they believe the comment was a breach of respect. The answer isn't straightforward, but the key factors are the intensity of the reaction versus the perceived slight.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While the girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive of his dedication to trampolining, breaking up immediately over a single conversation is an extreme reaction that doesn't allow for dialogue or understanding. Relationships require communication and effort to address conflicts, and ending the relationship without discussion undermines the possibility of resolving misunderstandings. The girlfriend's friends are correct in suggesting the reaction is disproportionate to the situation.",
