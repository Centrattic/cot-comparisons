Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was a high-level national athlete in trampolining, dedicating 12 years and a lot of time to it. His girlfriend, after a few months of dating, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implied that it's easier than real sports like soccer. The author took this as a personal attack on his dedication and identity, leading him to break up immediately. His friends and others think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend's comment was dismissive of his sport, which he considers a significant part of his identity. He feels disrespected, leading to the breakup. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's comment was clearly disrespectful. Dismissing someone's passion and dedication can be hurtful, especially when it's a core part of their identity. The author's reaction is based on feeling attacked, which is a valid emotional response given the sport's importance in his life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that breaking up over a single conversation is too drastic. However, the girlfriend's statement wasn't just a joke or a minor comment; it was a direct dismissal of his achievements and the effort he put into his sport. For someone who has invested so much, this could feel like a fundamental disrespect.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend had known about his sport for a while, and this was the first time she made such a comment. The fact that she downplayed his sport and compared it to a more popular one (soccer) suggests a lack of respect. The author's decision to leave might be seen as protecting his self-worth and standing up for his values.\n\nThe friends' reactions might be biased, as they could be closer to the author and his history with the sport. It's possible they don't understand the depth of his feelings towards trampolining.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, mutual respect is crucial. If one partner consistently belittles the other's passions or achievements, it can lead to deeper issues. The author's immediate reaction might be impulsive, but the underlying issue is about respect and validation. If the girlfriend didn't respect a core aspect of his identity, the relationship might have other unresolved issues.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. His reaction is a defense of his self-respect and the acknowledgment of his dedication. The girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his identity, which is a valid reason for ending the relationship.\n"
