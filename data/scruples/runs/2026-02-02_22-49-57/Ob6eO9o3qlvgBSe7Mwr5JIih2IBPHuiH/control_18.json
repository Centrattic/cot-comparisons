Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicates 12 years to trampolining, a high-level sport, representing Canada. Then, after an injury, he quits. He meets his girlfriend, who knew about his sport and seemed to find it cool. In a conversation about sports, she downplays trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's not as hard as other sports like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and commitment, leading to the breakup. Her friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small.\n\nThe key points here are the value of personal dedication, respect for others' achievements, and whether the reaction was proportionate. The author's sport is legitimate and requires significant effort, and the girlfriend's comments might have been dismissive or disrespectful. However, breaking up over a single comment could be seen as overreacting, even if the comment was hurtful.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's dedication was a huge part of his identity. If someone dismisses a core part of your life, that can be deeply hurtful. The question is whether her comment was a valid critique or an attack. She might not have realized how personal it was. But the author's reaction of immediately breaking up might be seen as too harsh, even if the comment was hurtful. However, if the comment revealed a deeper disrespect or devaluation of his achievements, maybe breaking up was justified.\n\nAlso, the friends' reaction says the author is an asshole, but that could be because they don't understand the emotional impact. Sometimes close friends might not see the depth of a relationship issue. The author felt that the comment attacked who he is, which is a big deal. However, reacting to a single conversation by ending the relationship could be seen as impulsive, especially if there were no prior signs of disrespect. \n\nIn many cases, communication and addressing the issue might be better than an immediate breakup. But if this comment was indicative of a pattern where she consistently undervalues his achievements, then maybe the breakup is justified. The problem here is that it's a one-time incident, so it's hard to tell if it's a red flag.\n\nSo, considering the scenario, the author did dedicate a lot to his sport, and the girlfriend's comment was dismissive. If that comment was a deal-breaker for him, it's his choice. But others might see it as overreacting. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was proportionate. Since the comment was about a core part of his identity, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that breaking up over something like that is too extreme. However, given that the comment was about his dedication and achievements, and it's a core part of who he is, the author's reaction could be justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
