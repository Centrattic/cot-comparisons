My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is an 18-year-old woman from a traditional family but values independence. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family as well, has views she finds sexist. The key points here are his comments about her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and his reaction to outperforming him, plus his comment about not dating someone with a higher salary.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns. He's acting shocked and says her dad would be ashamed. That's a direct criticism of her work, which she enjoys and sees as a way to earn her own money. This seems dismissive of her autonomy and implies that certain jobs aren't appropriate for women. That's a problem.\n\nThen his insistence on paying for everything. While it's common for some to let the guy pay on dates, the author feels it's crossing a line when he gets upset if she tries to buy him a snack. This could be seen as controlling or not respecting her ability to contribute. It's important that both partners feel equal in the relationship, and his reactions might be stifling her independence.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his comments about salary are more direct. If he felt he should earn more and not date someone with a higher salary, that's a clear gender stereotype. Even if he apologized, his behavior shows a belief in traditional gender roles that devalue women's competence and earning potential. The author is right to be upset about this because it's a form of sexism.\n\nThe author's response is to consider breaking up, which is her right. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. Her parents also support independence, so she's not \"triggered\" without cause. The boyfriend's actions and statements indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy and capabilities, which are valid reasons to end the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is sexist, and she's justified in wanting to leave the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
