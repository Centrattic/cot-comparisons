My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl (18F) who's dating a guy she thinks is sexist, and she's considering breaking up with him. The key points are his reactions to her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and his comment about making more money than her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the guy's actions. When she mentions mowing lawns, he's shocked and says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's a problem because it undermines her work and implies that her job isn't appropriate. Then, he insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she tries to buy something for him. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting her independence. Plus, his comment about making more money than her is clearly sexist, suggesting he believes men should earn more and that a woman's higher salary is an issue.\n\nThe author's parents raised her to be independent, which she appreciates. So she's used to self-reliance and might find his behavior patronizing. The guy might not realize that his actions are sexist, thinking he's being respectful. But the author feels disrespected and incapable because he won't let her contribute. The breaking point was after the rock climbing incident and his salary comment. She's conflicted but feels he's too traditional for her.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for her values and independence. Wanting to leave a relationship where the partner has sexist views isn't being in the wrong. The guy's behavior is problematic, and she has valid reasons to feel offended. The answer should be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
