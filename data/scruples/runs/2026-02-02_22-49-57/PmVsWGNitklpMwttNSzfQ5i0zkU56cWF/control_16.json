My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The question is from an Ask aITA post, so it's a real-life scenario where someone is seeking advice.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old female who comes from a traditional family but her parents don't push traditional gender roles on her. She's independent, works a summer job mowing lawns, and values her self-sufficiency. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family, has views she finds sexist. He comments that he would be ashamed if his dad were her dad for her mowing lawns and insists on paying for everything. She feels disrespected and wants to break up because he's sexist and outdated.\n\nSo, the key points are his comments about her job (shaming her for working in the heat), expecting to pay for everything to the point of getting upset when she buys something for him, and making a statement that he should make more money than her. She feels he's treating her like a princess instead of respecting her independence. He apologized but she thinks he still holds those views, so she's considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her feelings are valid. She's standing up for her independence and values. Her boyfriend's comments do sound sexist. For example, saying he'd be ashamed of her for working, implying her job isn't appropriate, and expecting her to rely on him financially. Also, the comment about not dating a woman who makes more money is definitely a traditional, sexist view.\n\nHer parents taught her to be independent, which she values. The BF's behavior conflicts with her values. She's not being overly sensitive here; she's reacting to his disrespect towards her work and autonomy. His apologies might not be genuine if he's not changing his behavior. Wanting to break up over these issues is reasonable, especially if they're fundamental to who she is.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? No. She's asserting her right to be treated as an equal. The BF's actions and views are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
