My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (18F) is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns. That's problematic because it undermines her work and implies a traditional gender role expectation. The author likes her job and feels it's about her independence. The BF's reaction here is not supportive and shows a lack of respect for her choices.\n\nThen, the BF insists on paying for everything. While it's common for some to pay on dates, the BF throws a fit if she tries to buy anything for him, even small things. This makes her feel incapable, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships should allow both partners to contribute and feel appreciated, not infantilized.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and the comment about always making more money are also issues. The BF's excuses after she outperformed him indicate insecurity or traditional gender role expectations. His statement about not dating a woman with a higher salary is clearly sexist. Even though he apologized, the author feels he's just avoiding conflict and still holds those views. That's a big deal because it shows a lack of genuine change or understanding.\n\nThe author values independence, which was emphasized by her parents. She feels her BF is too traditional and doesn't respect her autonomy. The BF, on the other hand, thinks he's being respectful by treating her a certain way, but that's based on outdated views.\n\nNow, considering cultural context. The BF comes from a traditional family, but the author's family is more progressive. Their differing values are clashing. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her beliefs and independence. The BF's behavior is what's problematic here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to break up. The BF's actions and statements are sexist and undermine her autonomy. The author has valid reasons to feel triggered and decide the relationship isn't compatible. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
