My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. The situation involves several key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively when the author mows lawns, suggesting she should be ashamed and offering to give her money instead. That's a problem because the author is trying to be independent and self-sufficient, which her parents supported. The boyfriend's reaction undermines her efforts and implies her job isn't respectable, which is a form of sexism.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything, even small things like a snack. The author feels this makes her feel incapable. The boyfriend's need to control who pays might stem from traditional gender roles where men are supposed to be the financial providers, which again can be seen as sexist. The author values equality and mutual contribution, which the boyfriend isn't respecting.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and the comment about him always making more money are also significant. The boyfriend's excuses and the salary comment clearly show a belief in traditional gender roles where men should be the higher earners. The author feels this is outdated and offensive, leading her to consider breaking up.\n\nThe author's perspective is that her boyfriend is being sexist, and she's justified in feeling that way. Her parents taught her independence, and she's trying to maintain that. The boyfriend's actions and words conflict with her values, making the relationship unsustainable for her. The boyfriend's apologies seem insincere, and he's not truly changing his views.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship. She's standing up for her values and recognizing the sexist behaviors in her partner. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and shared values, and if those aren't there, it's reasonable to move on. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
