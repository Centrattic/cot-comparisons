My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author (18F) is considering breaking up with her boyfriend because she finds his behavior sexist. Her parents are traditional but raised her to be independent. The boyfriend comes from a traditional family too, but his views differ. He's dismissive of her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, gets upset when she outperforms him, and makes a comment about always earning more than her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the boyfriend's actions are indeed sexist. The boyfriend's reactions seem to challenge the author's independence. For example, criticizing her for mowing lawns, treating her financial independence as a problem, and not wanting her to have a higher salary. These actions could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles where women are not expected to work as hard or earn as much as men. Even though he might think he's being respectful by paying for things, it's making the author feel infantilized.\n\nThe author's perspective is that she was raised to be independent, so the boyfriend's behavior clashes with her values. She's not just being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her right to be self-sufficient. The boyfriend's apology after the salary comment might not be genuine if he still holds those views, which could indicate a lack of willingness to change.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the boyfriend is just expressing his upbringing and not intending to be sexist. But the key here is that the author is uncomfortable and feels disrespected. In a relationship, both partners should respect each other's values. If there's a fundamental mismatch, it's valid for the author to reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way or wanting to break up. Her actions are based on her own values and the need for mutual respect. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
