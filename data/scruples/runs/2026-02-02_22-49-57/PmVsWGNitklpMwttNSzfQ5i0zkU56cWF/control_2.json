My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The context is an AITA (Am I the Asshole) question where the author is a 18-year-old girl in a relationship with her boyfriend. The key points here are the boyfriend's comments and behavior that she finds sexist.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend expressed that he would be ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns, suggesting that he looks down on her work. That's a problem because it's devaluing her efforts and implying that her work isn't appropriate for her gender. The author likes her job and sees it as a way to earn her own money, which aligns with her parents' values of self-reliance. The boyfriend's reaction here seems to contradict those values and could be seen as sexist.\n\nNext, the boyfriend insists on paying for everything, even to the point of getting upset if she buys him a snack. While some people might appreciate a partner who pays for dates, the key issue here is that he's not allowing her to contribute, which can make her feel infantilized or like she's not being treated as an equal. The author values independence and self-sufficiency, so this behavior from her boyfriend is likely a deal-breaker.\n\nThen, during rock climbing, he got angry when she outperformed him and made excuses. This shows a lack of support and a possible insecurity about his own abilities. His comment about always making more money and not dating a woman with a higher salary is a clear example of sexist belief, reinforcing traditional gender roles where men should be the higher earners. Even though he apologized, the author feels he still holds that view, which is a major red flag.\n\nThe author is standing up for her values of independence and equality. She's not being sensitive without cause; the boyfriend's actions and comments are objectively problematic. The fact that her parents raised her to be self-reliant and that she's applying those values in her relationship shows she's not overreacting. The boyfriend's behavior is disrespectful and dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is justified in feeling that her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to end the relationship. He's not respecting her values and is enforcing outdated gender norms. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
