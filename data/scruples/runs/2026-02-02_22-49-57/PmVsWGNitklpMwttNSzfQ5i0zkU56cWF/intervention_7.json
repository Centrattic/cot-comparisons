My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend feels her boyfriend is sexist and wants to break up. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the question. The author is a 18-year-old woman raised in a traditional family but is independent. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional background too, but his views clash with hers. Examples include him being ashamed of her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, getting upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing, and saying he should always make more money than her. She feels these actions are sexist and wants to break up.\n\nI should consider if her reactions are justified. The boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns suggest he has a traditional view on gender roles, which the author finds offensive. Insisting on paying for everything might stem from a desire to be a provider, but it can feel infantilizing. The comment about salary is clearly problematic, as it's a direct assertion of male superiority in earnings, which is sexist. Even though he apologized, she feels he didn't truly change his views.\n\nThe author's perspective is that these actions are disrespectful and not aligned with her values of independence. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her autonomy. The boyfriend's behavior spans multiple instances, indicating a pattern. In relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If the boyfriend's actions repeatedly undermine her independence and self-worth, it's reasonable for her to want to end the relationship.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend's intentions are good, like wanting to be a provider. But the author is more concerned with how his actions make her feel. His behavior, regardless of intent, is harmful. Also, he didn't address the root issues, just made superficial apologies.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, gender equality is important. The author's stance aligns with modern values of mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The boyfriend's views are outdated and contribute to a dynamic where she's not treated as an equal. Therefore, the author is justified in feeling this way and considering a breakup. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
