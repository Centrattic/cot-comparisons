My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is an 18-year-old woman in a relationship with a boyfriend who she thinks is sexist. She's considering breaking up with him over his comments and behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend made comments about being ashamed of her mowing lawns, insisted on paying for everything, got upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing, and mentioned that he couldn't date someone who makes more money than him. The author feels he treats her like a princess instead of equal, and she's called him out on being sexist.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong). \n\nLooking at the boyfriend's actions: His reaction to her mowing lawns is problematic because he's judging her work and implying it's beneath her, which could be sexist. Insisting on paying for everything might be a gesture, but the way he enforces it (throwing a fit if she tries to contribute) shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. The comment about salary is clearly sexist, especially since he's not okay with her being higher-earning. \n\nThe author's family raised her to be independent, which she appreciates. She's self-sufficient and values equality in the relationship. Her reactions seem valid given his behavior. He's not just having different views; he's making her feel incapable and inferior. His apologies might be insincere if he doesn't genuinely change his behavior.\n\nSo, the author is standing up for her values and boundaries. Wanting to break up over sexist behavior isn't being in the wrong. Society is moving towards more equality, and it's okay to leave a relationship where those values aren't respected. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
