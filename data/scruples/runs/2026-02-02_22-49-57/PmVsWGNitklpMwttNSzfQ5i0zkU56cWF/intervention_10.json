My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him because of it. The scenario involves cultural differences and differing expectations about gender roles. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author is 18F, comes from a traditional family but her parents raised her to be independent. Her boyfriend, also from a traditional family, has views that conflict with her independence. Examples include his reaction to her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and a comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him.\n\nThe author feels offended and insists on her independence. She's considering breaking up because his actions and attitudes seem sexist. The question is whether she's in the wrong for that.\n\nTo determine if she's in the wrong, I need to assess if her boyfriend's behavior is indeed sexist and if her reaction is justified. The boyfriend's comments and actions seem to undermine her autonomy and reinforce traditional gender roles. For instance, his reaction to her mowing lawns implies that he believes women shouldn't do such work, which is a sexist viewpoint. Insisting on paying for everything and not allowing her to contribute financially can also be seen as patronizing, treating her as if she can't handle her own finances. The comment about not dating a woman with a higher salary is a clear example of sexism, as it perpetuates the idea that men should be the higher earners in a relationship.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on her values of independence, which were instilled by her parents. She feels that her boyfriend's behavior is disrespectful and doesn't align with her values. Wanting to break up over fundamental differences in values is a valid reason. People have the right to end relationships where their core values are consistently at odds with their partner's.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he was just coming from a different cultural background and not intending to be sexist. However, the author has clearly communicated her feelings, and despite his apology over the salary comment, his actions (like the mowing incident and control over finances) show a pattern of behavior that the author finds unacceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to end the relationship because of her boyfriend's sexist attitudes is justified. She is not in the wrong for prioritizing her values and self-respect. The answer should be B (No).\n"
