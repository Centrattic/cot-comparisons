My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments about mowing lawns and his dad being ashamed come across as condescending. He's implying that her work isn't appropriate for a woman, which is a traditional, sexist viewpoint. The author values independence and self-sufficiency, which her parents also supported. So his reaction is dismissive of her efforts and autonomy.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people appreciate this gesture, the author feels it undermines her ability to contribute and be independent. He gets upset when she tries to buy him something small, which can make her feel unappreciated. This dynamic might be about control or traditional gender roles where he expects to be the sole provider, which conflicts with her values.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his subsequent comments about making more money are also key. He felt threatened when she outperformed him and made excuses. Then his statement about not dating a woman who earns more shows a clear belief in male superiority in financial terms. Even though he apologized, the author senses he didn't genuinely change his views. That's a significant issue because it shows a lack of growth and respect for her capabilities.\n\nThe author is questioning if she's overreacting. She mentions her independence and not wanting to rely on him, which are valid personal values. The boyfriend's behavior consistently undermines her autonomy and reinforces outdated gender roles. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner's actions continually contradict the other's values, it's reasonable to consider ending it.\n\nSo, looking at all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and attitudes are the problematic ones. The answer should be B.\n"
