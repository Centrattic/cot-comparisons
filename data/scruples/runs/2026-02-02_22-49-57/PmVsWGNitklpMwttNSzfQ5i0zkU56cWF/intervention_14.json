My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The original question is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) subreddit, where the author is considering breaking up with her boyfriend over what she perceives as sexist behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 18F, comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters' independence. She's working hard, mows lawns, and values self-reliance. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family, has different views. He acted shocked about her mowing lawns, said her dad would be ashamed, and offered to give her money instead. Also, he insists on paying for everything, gets upset when she buys him things, and made a comment about him always making more money and not dating a woman with a higher salary.\n\nThe author is upset because these behaviors seem sexist. She feels her boyfriend is treating her like a \"princess\" instead of seeing her as an equal. She's considering breaking up and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the boyfriend's actions are indeed sexist or if the author is overreacting. Let's analyze the boyfriend's behavior. When he found out she mows lawns, his reaction was shock and implying her father would be ashamed. That's problematic because it undermines her choice to work and earn her own money. By suggesting she should rely on him for money, he's reinforcing traditional gender roles where men are the breadwinners and women shouldn't have certain jobs.\n\nHis insistence on paying for everything and getting upset when she buys him things could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. He's not allowing her to contribute, even in small ways, which might make her feel infantilized. The rock climbing incident where he made excuses for his poor performance and then the comment about always making more money are clear examples of believing in traditional gender roles where men are superior in income and physical ability. Even if he later apologized, the fact that he made such a statement shows underlying sexist beliefs.\n\nThe author's upbringing emphasizes independence, which contrasts with her boyfriend's views. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. The boyfriend's actions consistently show a lack of respect for her independence and equality. The key point is whether these behaviors are just differences in opinion or actual sexism. The boyfriend's statements about income and his reaction to her working suggest that he holds beliefs that women should not be in certain roles or earn more than men, which is a form of sexism.\n\nTherefore, the author is justified in feeling that her boyfriend is sexist and choosing to break up. She's not in the wrong for standing up for her values and seeking a relationship that respects her autonomy and independence. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
