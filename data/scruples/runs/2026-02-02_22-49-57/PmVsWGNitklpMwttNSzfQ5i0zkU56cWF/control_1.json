My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is an 18-year-old female from a traditional family, but her family encourages independence. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional background too, but his actions are causing tension.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend comments that he'd be ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns. That's a clear problem. Shaming a partner's work, especially when she's proud of it, is dismissive and disrespectful. It's about her choices and his inability to accept her independence.\n\nThen, he insists on paying for everything. While some people might like that, the user is frustrated because he doesn't allow her to contribute. The issue is about equality in the relationship. If he throws a fit when she buys something small, it shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and his own insecurity maybe?\n\nThe rock climbing incident where he was upset she outperformed him is another red flag. He made excuses and wasn't open to acknowledging her skills. Then the comment about always making more money than her and not dating someone with a higher salary is clearly sexist. Even if he apologized, the user feels he didn't truly change his mindset. \n\nThe user is justified in feeling disrespected. She values independence and equality, which are important in a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's behavior doesn't align with her values, and she's right to want to break up if he can't adapt. The fact that he apologized but might still hold those views shows he's not fully committed to changing. \n\nSo, the answer should be No (B), the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her values and independence, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n"
