My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a girl (18F) who's upset with her boyfriend for being sexist. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a traditional family but her parents support her independence. She works a summer job mowing lawns, which she enjoys. Her boyfriend criticizes her for working, saying he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's a big red flag. Insulting her dad and implying that her job is beneath her seems disrespectful and sexist.\n\nThen, there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything. While some people might like that, she feels it's infantilizing. She wants to be able to buy things for him, but he gets upset. That control over finances isn't healthy.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction to her doing better than him. He made excuses and later said he couldn't date someone who makes more money. That's clearly sexist. Even though he apologized, she feels he still holds those views. His apology might just be to avoid conflict, not a genuine change.\n\nThe author is conflicted, thinking maybe she's too sensitive. But her points are valid. The boyfriend's behavior shows traditional, sexist attitudes that don't align with her values. Wanting to break up because of these issues isn't being \"overly sensitive\"; it's standing up for her self-respect and independence.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her concerns are justified, and the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. She's right to reconsider the relationship if his views are incompatible with hers.\n"
