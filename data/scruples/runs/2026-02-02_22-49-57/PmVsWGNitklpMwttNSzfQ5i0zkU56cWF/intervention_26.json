My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. The author is a 18-year-old woman who's coming from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has traditional views that she finds sexist.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend commented that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns. That's a direct insult to her father and her job. She likes her job, which is about independence and earning her own money. The boyfriend's reaction here seems to devalue her work and implies that her role should be different, which is sexist.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While it's common for some people to let their partner pay on dates, the boyfriend takes it to an extreme where he doesn't allow her to buy even small things for him. This could be a power dynamic issue, making the author feel incapable rather than appreciated. The line between a kind gesture and controlling behavior is thin here. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from outdated gender roles where the man should always pay, which can be seen as condescending.\n\nThe rock climbing incident is another point. He got upset when she outperformed him and made excuses. Then later, he mentions that he can't date someone who makes more money. Even though he apologized, the author feels he didn't genuinely change his stance. This shows a lack of respect for her capabilities and reinforces traditional gender roles where men are supposed to be the primary earners.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid. She values independence and equality, which her boyfriend's actions contradict. She's not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing his behavior as sexist. The boyfriend's apologies might be surface-level if he's not truly reflecting on his views. The author's decision to break up is based on incompatible values, which is a reasonable choice for her well-being.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. Her boyfriend's actions and statements clearly display sexist attitudes. The author is standing up for her values and her need for equality in the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
