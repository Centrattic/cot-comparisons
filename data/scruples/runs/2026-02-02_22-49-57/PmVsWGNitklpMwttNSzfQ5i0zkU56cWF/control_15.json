My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is from an AMA (Ask Me Anything) style post where the author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) because they want to break up with their boyfriend over what they perceive as sexist behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author is 18F, comes from a traditional family but her parents don't push traditional gender roles on her. They support her independence. The boyfriend also comes from a traditional family but his views are more rigid. The issues mentioned: he expressed shame that she mows lawns, insists on paying for everything even when she wants to contribute, got upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing, and made a comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him.\n\nThe author feels these behaviors are sexist and wants to break up. The question is whether she's in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nI need to analyze whether the boyfriend's actions are indeed problematic and if the author's reaction is justified. The boyfriend's comments about being ashamed of her mowing lawns implies that he thinks such work is beneath her as a woman. Insisting on paying for everything could be seen as infantilizing her, treating her as someone who can't handle her own finances. The comment about not dating a woman with a higher salary is clearly sexist, reinforcing the idea that men should be the higher earners in a relationship. His reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing also shows insecurity and a traditional view of male superiority in physical activities.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on these behaviors being sexist and conflicting with her values of independence and equality. Her parents raised her to be self-sufficient, and the boyfriend's actions are in contrast to that. She's not just being overly sensitive; she's pointing out concrete examples of his sexist attitudes. The boyfriend's apologies seem insincere, addressing the symptoms rather than the root issue.\n\nIn terms of relationship values, if two people have fundamentally different views on gender roles and respect for each other's autonomy, it's reasonable to expect that this would be a deal-breaker. The author isn't wrong for valuing equality and independence in her partner. Therefore, she's justified in wanting to break up if these issues are deal-breakers for her.\n"
