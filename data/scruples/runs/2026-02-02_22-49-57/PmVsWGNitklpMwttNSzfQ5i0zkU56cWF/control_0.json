My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a girl (18F) who feels her boyfriend is sexist and wants to break up because of it. She comes from a traditional family but they raised her to be independent. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has different views.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns. He says if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's pretty clear sexism; implying that her job isn't suitable for a woman. The author is offended, which is a valid reaction. She likes her job and it helps her financially. The BF's reaction undermines her independence and her choice.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people might appreciate it, the author feels it makes her feel incapable. She's used to being self-sufficient. The BF throwing a fit when she buys him a snack shows a lack of reciprocity and might be controlling. The key here is mutual respect. The BF isn't respecting her autonomy and independence.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction when she outperformed him. He made excuses and then later said he couldn't date someone with a higher salary. That's a clear bias towards traditional gender roles where men are supposed to earn more. Even if he apologized, the fact that he made such a comment shows underlying sexist beliefs. The author feels this is a deal-breaker, which is understandable.\n\nThe BF claims he's being respectful by treating her like a princess, but the author sees it as condescending. She values her independence and equality in the relationship. The BF's actions and attitudes clash with her values. The question is whether her decision to break up is justified.\n\nLooking at the BF's perspective, maybe he's coming from a place where he doesn't realize his behavior is sexist. But the author is clear that his actions are hurtful and don't align with her values. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If one partner's actions consistently contradict the other's values, it's a valid reason to end the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling triggered and wanting to break up. She's standing by her principles and her need for a partner who respects her independence and equality. The BF's behavior is problematic, not hers. The answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
