My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (18F) is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. The situation involves several points where the boyfriend's actions come off as patronizing.\n\nFirst, he reacts negatively to her mowing lawns, implying that her father would be ashamed. That's a direct insult to her and her father's choice. She's proud of being independent, and his reaction undermines her autonomy. Then there's the insistence on paying for everything, even small things like a snack. While some might appreciate a guy paying for dates, the key here is that he doesn't allow her to reciprocate in any way, making her feel incapable. That's a red flag for unequal treatment.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his subsequent comment about always making more money than her solidify the sexist behavior. His apology seems insincere, as he makes excuses for his poor performance instead of acknowledging her skill. The fact that he can't accept a relationship where she might earn more is a classic case of traditional gender roles. \n\nThe author's family raised her to be independent, and she's grateful for that. She's not being overly sensitive; she's reacting to consistent behaviors that show a lack of respect for her independence and capabilities. The boyfriend's actions align with outdated views where men are supposed to be the providers and women are to be taken care of. The author is justified in feeling that his behavior is sexist and that their values are misaligned. \n\nBreaking up because of fundamental differences in gender roles and respect for each other's autonomy is not being in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions consistently show disrespect for her independence, which is a significant issue in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
