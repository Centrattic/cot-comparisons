My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question where a girl (18F) is considering breaking up with her boyfriend because he has what she perceives as sexist views.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the boyfriend's behavior. The key points are:\n\n1. When the author mows lawns for extra cash, the boyfriend says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad and suggests she should just ask him for money instead. This is problematic because it dismisses her work and implies she shouldn't be doing such a job. It also undermines her independence and the value of her labor, which aligns with traditional gender roles where women aren't expected to work in certain ways.\n\n2. He insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys him a small item like a snack. This could be seen as controlling and not valuing her autonomy. While some people appreciate chivalry, expecting to pay for everything and reacting negatively when the other person tries to contribute can be overbearing.\n\n3. After she outperforms him in rock climbing, he gets angry and makes excuses. Then he says he can't date a woman who earns more than him. Even though he apologized, she feels he didn't truly change his view but just wanted to avoid conflict. This comment is clearly sexist, suggesting that a woman's career and earning potential should be subordinate to his.\n\nThe author's family encourages independence and self-reliance, which she appreciates. Her boyfriend's actions and beliefs contrast with her values. She's not being overly sensitive here; she's standing up for her own values and recognizing that his behavior is disrespectful to her independence and capabilities.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and shared values are crucial. The boyfriend's insistence on traditional gender roles and his dismissive attitudes towards her work and independence are valid reasons for her to reconsider the relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to break up.\n"
