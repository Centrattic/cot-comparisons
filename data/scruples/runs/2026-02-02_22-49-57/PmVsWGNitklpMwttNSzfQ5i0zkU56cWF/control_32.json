My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether she's justified in thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation from her perspective. She has a traditional family but they don't push any specific gender roles on her. Her parents encourage independence and she's self-sufficient, like mowing lawns for extra money. She appreciates her upbringing and values her independence.\n\nNow, her boyfriend has different views. He's uncomfortable with her mowing lawns, saying he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's a problem because it insults her father and she likes her job. Also, he insists on paying for everything, even little things like snacks, which makes her feel incapable. Then there's the rock climbing incident where he got upset she did better and later said he'd always make more money than her, which she found sexist.\n\nHe apologized for the salary comment, but she thinks he just did to avoid an argument. She's tired of being treated like a princess, and he thinks he's being respectful by taking care of her. She's considering breaking up because his views are too old-fashioned.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, his comments definitely cross into sexism. The idea that a man should always earn more and that a woman shouldn't have certain jobs (like mowing lawns) are outdated and discriminatory. His behavior, like refusing to let her pay for things, also supports traditional gender roles that don't respect her independence. She's standing up for her values, which he's not willing to adjust. \n\nHe's not just being a traditional person with different opinions; his actions and statements are condescending and disrespectful. She's not being overly sensitive if she finds these things offensive. Wanting a partner who respects her autonomy and equal standing is valid. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting to break up. The answer should be B.\n"
