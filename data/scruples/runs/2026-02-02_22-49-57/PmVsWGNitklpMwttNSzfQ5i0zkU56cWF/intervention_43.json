My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the author (18F) is breaking up with her boyfriend over what she perceives as sexist behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The boyfriend's family is traditional, but his views seem more rigid. He made comments about her mowing lawns, saying he'd be ashamed as her dad. That's problematic because it undermines her work and insinuates that her job is beneath her. She finds it empowering and enjoys it. Then, he insists on paying for everything, getting upset when she tries to buy him a snack. This could be a form of control, making her feel incapable. Then, the rock climbing incident where he was upset she did better and his comment about always making more money than her. That's a clear sexist statement, even if he apologized.\n\nThe author's parents raised her to be independent, which she values. She feels his behavior is infantilizing and controlling. She's considering breaking up because his views clash with her values. \n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions include making sexist remarks, controlling her financially, and not respecting her independence. The author is standing up for herself and her values. Her perspective is that his behavior is sexist and incompatible with her values. Even if he apologizes, the underlying issues persist. The author's response is a matter of personal values and compatibility. \n\nIn relationships, shared values are crucial. If one partner's actions consistently conflict with the other's, it's reasonable to seek a resolution, including breaking up. The author isn't being overly sensitive here; she's recognizing the incompatibility. The boyfriend's behavior, while he may not intend it, perpetuates traditional gender roles that she rejects. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her decision to end the relationship is justified based on the disrespectful and controlling behaviors of her boyfriend. So the answer should be B.\n"
