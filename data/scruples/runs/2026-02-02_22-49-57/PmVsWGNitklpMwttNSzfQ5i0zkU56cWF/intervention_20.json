My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is an 18-year-old girl from a traditional family but with parents who support her independence. She's working, going to college, and wants to be self-sufficient. Her boyfriend, also from a traditional family, has views that seem outdated to her. He's shocked she mows lawns, insists on paying for everything, and didn't like her outperforming him in rock climbing. She feels he's sexist and wants to break up.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns. He's implying her father would be ashamed, which is invalidating her choice and her father's values. Also, suggesting she should just ask him for money instead of working might be a way to undermine her independence. Then, the insistence on paying for everything, even small things, could be controlling. She's okay with him paying on dates, but not to the point where she can't contribute anything. His reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing shows insecurity and maybe a belief in traditional gender roles where men should be better. The salary comment is pretty direct in assuming he should earn more, which is clearly sexist.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid here. She's working hard and values her independence. The boyfriend's behavior seems to stem from traditional views that don't align with her own. Even though he apologized, she believes it was just to avoid conflict. The key issue is mutual respect for each other's values. If the boyfriend isn't willing to adapt, it's a red flag. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to break up because she's standing up for her beliefs and needs in the relationship.\n"
