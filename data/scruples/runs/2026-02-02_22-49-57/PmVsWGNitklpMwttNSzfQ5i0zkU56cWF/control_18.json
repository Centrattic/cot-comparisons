My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is an 18-year-old woman from a traditional family, but her parents are actually supporting her independence. She's working, going to college, and is self-sufficient. Her boyfriend, also from a traditional background, has some views that clash with hers. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend comments that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns in the heat and suggests she should just ask him for money. That's pretty condescending. The user finds that offensive because it undermines her choice to work and her father's support. Then there's the insistence on paying for everything, even small things like snacks, making her feel incapable instead of appreciated. \n\nThen there's the incident at rock climbing where he was upset she did better and made excuses. Later, he mentions he should always make more money than her, which she finds sexist. He apologized quickly, but she feels he still holds that view. \n\nThe main issues here are the boyfriend's condescending attitude towards her work, the insistence on financial control, and the belief that men should earn more. The user is standing up for her independence and self-reliance, which her parents actually support. Her boyfriend's actions and comments seem to reflect traditional gender roles that she finds outdated and sexist. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to break up. Her reasoning is based on his sexist behavior and not respecting her independence. Given that she's in a relationship where her values are consistently clashing with his, and he's not being supportive but rather dismissive, it's reasonable for her to feel this way. The boyfriend's behavior includes shaming her for work, financial control, and wage disparity comments. These are valid concerns, and wanting to leave because of these issues isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's asserting her independence and rejecting sexist attitudes, which are valid reasons for ending a relationship.\n"
