My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (18F) being in a relationship with a boyfriend whose views she perceives as sexist. The key points of contention are:\n\n1. **Mowing Lawns Comment**: The boyfriend said he'd be ashamed if his father were her dad for her mowing lawns. The author feels this insults her father and her choice to work. He also suggests she should just ask him for money instead.\n\n2. **Insisting on Paying for Everything**: While the author is okay with him paying on dates, she's frustrated by his insistence on paying for everything, even small things like a snack, and not allowing her to reciprocate. This makes her feel incapable.\n\n3. **Competing at Rock Climbing**: The boyfriend got upset when she outperformed him and made excuses. Later, he mentioned he would always make more money than her and couldn't date someone with a higher salary.\n\n4. **Apology and Dynamics**: He apologized after the salary comment but the author feels he didn't truly change. She's tired of being treated like a princess and feels he has outdated views.\n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the boyfriend's actions are indeed sexist and if the author is justified in breaking up.\n\nFirst, **the mowing lawns comment** is problematic. It undermines her choice to work and implies that her labor is inappropriate or beneath her, which is a sexist viewpoint. The boyfriend's reaction suggests a belief that women should be protected from physically demanding work, which is a traditional gender role.\n\n**Insisting on paying for everything** can be seen as a form of control. While some may see it as chivalrous, if it's taken to an extreme where the other person can't contribute or feel equal in the relationship, it can be oppressive. The author values independence and self-reliance, so this behavior likely clashed with her values.\n\n**The rock climbing incident** highlights the boyfriend's insecurity and inability to handle being outperformed. His excuses and the salary comment indicate a belief in traditional gender roles where men are supposed to be superior in both physical and financial aspects. This is a clear example of sexist thinking.\n\nThe boyfriend's apology might be insincere if he's still holding onto those beliefs. The author's frustration stems from feeling that her independence is being stifled, which is valid given her upbringing emphasizing self-sufficiency.\n\nSo, the author is standing up for her values and independence, which are legitimate reasons for ending a relationship. The boyfriend's behaviors do cross into sexist territory, especially the salary comment and the lawn mowing remarks. The author isn't overreacting; she's recognizing that the relationship's dynamics are incompatible with her values. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
