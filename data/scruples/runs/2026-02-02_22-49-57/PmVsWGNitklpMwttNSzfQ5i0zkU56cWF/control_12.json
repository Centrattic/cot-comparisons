My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. The situation involves several points where the boyfriend's behavior could be seen as sexist.\n\nFirst, when he says he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns, that's a clear issue. It implies that her job is beneath her, which is a traditional sexist view. The author is doing something that's physically demanding, and he's criticizing her for it, which undermines her independence and his own support for her work.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While it's common for guys to pay on dates, the boyfriend goes further by getting upset if she buys him anything, even small things. This could be seen as him trying to control her spending or expecting her to be financially dependent, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe rock climbing incident adds another layer. He gets angry when she outperforms him and makes excuses. Then he mentions he can't be with someone who makes more money. This suggests he has traditional views about male dominance in relationships, which is definitely outdated and sexist.\n\nThe author's parents raised her to be independent, which contrasts with her boyfriend's attitudes. She's justified in feeling that his views are restrictive and not aligned with her values. Wanting to break up over such fundamental differences makes sense because values like respect for each other's independence and equality are crucial in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's apologies might not address the root of the problem if he still holds those beliefs. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's recognizing that his behavior is disrespectful and potentially harmful to her autonomy. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
