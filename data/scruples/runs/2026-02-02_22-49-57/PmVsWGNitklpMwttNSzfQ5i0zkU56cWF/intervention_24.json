My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old female from a traditional family where her mom stays home and her dad works, but they don't push that lifestyle onto their daughters. Instead, they encourage them to pursue their interests and be self-reliant. The author has a side job mowing lawns, which she enjoys, and her boyfriend doesn't seem to support that. He made a comment implying that he would be ashamed if he were her dad, and suggested she should just ask him for money instead. Then there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything, even small things like snacks, which makes the author feel incapable. Finally, during a rock climbing activity, the author outperformed him, and he got upset, making excuses. He later said he couldn't date a woman who earns more than him, which the author found sexist. She considered breaking up with him because of these things.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's behavior. The first comment about being ashamed as a father is definitely problematic. It's not just about his own views but also disrespects her family's choices. The author's family values her independence, and his reaction undermines that. Then, insisting on paying for everything and getting upset if she buys something for him could be a sign of controlling behavior or traditional gender roles that expect women to be financially dependent. The comment about not dating a woman with a higher salary is a clear expression of sexist beliefs, assuming that men should earn more than women, which is a harmful stereotype.\n\nThe author values independence and self-sufficiency, which her parents have instilled in her. She's offended by comments that dismiss her efforts and choices. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to have a traditional mindset that's conflicting with her values. The key here is whether the author is justified in feeling that these behaviors are sexist and incompatible with her values. \n\nThe boyfriend's apologies might be insincere if he's not changing his views, as the author suspects. If someone consistently makes comments that belittle another's independence and enforce gender stereotypes, that's a valid reason to reevaluate the relationship. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's recognizing that their core values clash, which is important for a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decisions are based on her upbringing and her own beliefs about equality and independence. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
