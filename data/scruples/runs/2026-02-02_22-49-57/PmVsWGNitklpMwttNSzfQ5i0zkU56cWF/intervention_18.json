My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is justified in thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points from the situation. The author is 18F, from a traditional family but with progressive parenting. Her parents support her independence and self-reliance. She works a summer job mowing lawns, which her boyfriend criticized, implying that her dad would be ashamed. That's a direct insult to her father and undermines her work ethic. \n\nThen, the boyfriend insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys him a snack. The author feels this makes her feel incapable, not appreciated. At rock climbing, he was upset she outperformed him and made excuses. Later, he said he couldn't date someone with a higher salary. Even though he apologized, she thinks he still holds the belief. \n\nThe author feels the boyfriend has outdated views on gender roles. The boyfriend, on the other hand, sees his actions as respectful and being a man. The author questions if she's being overly sensitive.\n\nNow, considering the context, the boyfriend's comments and actions seem to promote traditional gender roles that devalue the author's independence and work. The comment about not dating someone with a higher salary is a clear example of sexist belief. The fact that he apologized but the author feels it was just to avoid conflict suggests he didn't truly understand her perspective.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on her upbringing where she was encouraged to be independent. Her actions and desire to maintain self-reliance are valid. The boyfriend's behaviors are not respecting her values. In a healthy relationship, mutual respect and understanding of each other's values are essential. Since the boyfriend isn't aligning with the author's values and is making her feel undervalued, the author's decision to consider breaking up seems justified. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
