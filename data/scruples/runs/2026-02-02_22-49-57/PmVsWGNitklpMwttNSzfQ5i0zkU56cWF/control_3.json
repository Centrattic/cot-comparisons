My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girl (18F) who's upset with her boyfriend for being sexist and wants to break up because of it. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend comments that he would be ashamed of her for mowing lawns, suggesting she should just ask him for money instead. That's a problem because it's belittling her work and implying that her role should be passive. The girl values independence, which her parents encouraged, and she's offended by his attitude towards her job.\n\nThen, the boyfriend insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she tries to buy him a small item. While some people might appreciate a partner paying on dates, the key issue here is that he's making her feel incapable instead of appreciated. This could be a sign of unequal dynamics where he's trying to control or dictate the relationship's financial aspects.\n\nNext, during rock climbing, he gets upset when she outperforms him and makes excuses. Later, he mentions that he would always make more money than her and can't date someone with a higher salary. This is a clear sexist statement, suggesting that women should earn less than men. Even though he apologized, she feels he's insincere and still holds those views.\n\nThe girl is questioning if she's being overly sensitive, but her actions stem from her values of independence and equality. Her parents raised her to be self-sufficient, so she's likely reacting to behaviors that contradict her beliefs.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's comments and actions are problematic. Belittling her work, enforcing traditional gender roles, and making sexist remarks are valid concerns. The girl is standing up for her values, which is not the wrong thing to do. Wanting to end a relationship because of disrespectful and sexist behavior is reasonable.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that he was trying to be a \"gentleman\" by paying for things, but the issue here is that it's not just about gestures\u2014it's about control and unequal treatment. Also, his apology might have been insincere, which the girl recognizes as a red flag.\n\nIn conclusion, the girl isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to his sexist attitudes and behaviors. Her values and independence are valid, and the boyfriend's actions are what need to be addressed. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
