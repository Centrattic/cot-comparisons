My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old woman from a traditional family, but her parents didn't push traditional gender roles on her. They emphasized hard work and independence, expecting her to go to college, work, and support herself. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional family too, but his views are different from hers. He was shocked when she mows lawns for extra cash, saying if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. He insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys anything for him. When they went rock climbing, he got mad when she did better than him, and later said he couldn't date a woman who earns more than him. She called him out, he apologized, but she thinks he just did it to avoid an argument. She's considering breaking up because he's too sexist and old-fashioned, and she wants to be independent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author values independence and self-reliance, which her parents encouraged. Her boyfriend's comments and actions seem to challenge that. For example, he being ashamed of her mowing lawns implies a belief that women shouldn't do such work, which is sexist. Insisting on paying for everything and not allowing her to buy him things could be controlling or diminish her autonomy. The comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him is clearly sexist. \n\nThe boyfriend's reactions to her outperforming him in rock climbing and making excuses for his performance might also indicate a problem with his attitude towards her capabilities. His apologies but lack of real change (as the author suspects he still holds those views) suggest he's not committed to changing his behavior.\n\nThe author is feeling that her autonomy is being invaded and that her partner's views are incompatible with her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her right to be independent and equal in the relationship. Her parents' approach was to support her independence, so she's likely justified in valuing that. The boyfriend's actions and comments are problematic and could be seen as sexist, which the author is rightly addressing.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She's recognizing incompatible values in her partner and choosing to end the relationship, which is a valid and reasonable decision.\n"
