My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (18F) who is in a relationship with her boyfriend (BF), and she's considering breaking up because she finds his behavior sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the BF's actions and comments. The BF reacted negatively to the author mowing lawns, saying he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's a problem because it's condescending and dismissive of her work. Then, he insists on paying for everything, not allowing her to buy even small things for him, which makes her feel incapable. The BF also got upset when she beat him at rock climbing and made excuses, and he mentioned he couldn't date someone who makes more money than him.\n\nThe author comes from a family that values independence and self-reliance, which is clearly working well for her. The BF's family is traditional, but he's projecting his own traditional views onto her, which she doesn't share. The BF's comments about her work and financial independence are clear signs of sexism. He's not respecting her autonomy and is trying to control her, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nThe author is standing up for her beliefs and independence, which are valid. She's not being overly sensitive; the BF's behavior is problematic. The BF's apologies might not be genuine, and he's not changing his views, which is a key issue. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's values and support each other's goals without control.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's recognizing incompatible values and choosing to end the relationship, which is a responsible decision. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
