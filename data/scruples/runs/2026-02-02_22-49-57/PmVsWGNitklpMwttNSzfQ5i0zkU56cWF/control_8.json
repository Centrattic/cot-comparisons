My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author is a 18-year-old female in a relationship with her boyfriend, whom she finds sexist. The key issues here are the boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns, his insistence on paying for everything, his reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing, and his statement that he couldn't date someone who earns more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate each of these points. The boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns is problematic. He's implying that her work as a lawn mower is beneath her, which is a sexist view. His comment about being ashamed if he were her dad shows a lack of respect for her independence and the value of her work. The author takes pride in her independence, which her parents have encouraged, so his reaction is dismissive of her efforts and autonomy.\n\nNext, the boyfriend insisting on paying for everything, even to the point of getting upset if she buys him a small snack, is another red flag. While it's common and sometimes nice for someone to pay on dates, the boyfriend's behavior suggests an imbalance in the relationship. The author feels that this dynamic makes her feel incapable rather than appreciated. Healthy relationships should involve mutual respect and shared financial responsibility, so his insistence on controlling all expenses could be seen as overbearing.\n\nThen there's the rock climbing incident. The boyfriend gets angry when she outperforms him and makes excuses, which indicates insecurity or a need to maintain dominance. His reaction isn't about the activity itself but about his ego. This behavior shows a lack of support for her abilities, which is another sign of sexism. Additionally, his statement about not dating someone who earns more than him is a clear example of traditional, sexist belief that men should be the higher earners in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's apology seems insincere, as he only apologizes to avoid conflict rather than acknowledging his wrongdoings. This suggests that he isn't willing to change his views, which is a serious issue in a relationship. The author feels that these behaviors collectively make him too outdated and sexist for her, leading her to consider breaking up.\n\nNow, considering the user's background: she comes from a family that encourages independence and self-reliance, which she values. Her boyfriend's actions contradict these values. The question is whether she's overreacting. However, the boyfriend's comments and behaviors do exhibit sexist tendencies, and the author has the right to expect a partner who respects her independence and abilities. Wanting to break up because of these issues is a valid response.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Her concerns are based on legitimate issues of sexism and respect in the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
