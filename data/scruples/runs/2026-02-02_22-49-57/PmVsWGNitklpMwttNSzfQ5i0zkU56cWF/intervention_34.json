My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is justified in thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the specific incidents she mentions. The boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns is problematic. He's acting like her work is beneath her and implying that her father would be ashamed. That's definitely condescending and undermines her independence.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While it's common for men to pay on dates, the fact that he throws a fit if she buys something for him, even a small snack, shows a lack of respect for her agency. It makes her feel incapable, which is a red flag.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction to her outperforming him is another issue. His excuses and his statement about always making more money than her are clear indicators of sexist beliefs. Even though he apologized, the fact that he made the comment in the first place is a problem. The author feels like he's treating her like a princess, which she's not comfortable with, and she values her independence.\n\nThe author's background is that she was raised in a traditional family but her parents encouraged her to be independent and self-sufficient. She's glad for that, which is why she's so offended by her boyfriend's behavior. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values and self-respect.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions are about traditional gender roles and financial control, which are valid reasons for wanting to end a relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for recognizing these issues and deciding that their values are incompatible. Relationships should be based on mutual respect, and if one partner's actions consistently undermine the other's autonomy, it's reasonable to end it.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
