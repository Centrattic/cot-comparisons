I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 23, doesn't like kids and has a house that's not safe for them. His brother asked him at the last minute to watch the kids for a week so they can go on a cruise. The brother had planned this trip for five years, but they only asked two days before. The author said no because he's busy with work, doesn't get paid, and his house isn't kid-safe. The brother and his wife got angry, called him names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's side. He clearly stated that he doesn't like kids and his family knows that. He's working from home, has his own schedule, and his house isn't set up for kids. Also, he's saving PTO days for a trip. He's not being paid, which is a big factor. The brother's request is very last-minute, only two days before. That's not a lot of time to make his house safe or adjust his work schedule. Plus, he's mentioned that he's in a state where marijuana is legal, but the brother wants no drugs around the kids. So that's another point against him being able to comply.\n\nOn the other side, the brother had a long-planned trip. They couldn't get their sister because of an emergency. Maybe they were in a bind. But they should have thought about this earlier. Asking family for last-minute childcare is tough, especially if they know the person isn't a fan of kids. The brother's reaction seems harsh\u2014they yelled for an hour, called him names, and posted on Facebook. That's not a healthy way to handle it.\n\nThe key points here are the timing, the author's prior commitments, and the fact that he's known to hate kids. The brother's family emergency might be a mitigating factor, but they still should have considered alternative childcare options if they knew the sister was the main backup. The author isn't in a position to take on the responsibility, and the brother's response was hostile. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he had valid reasons to decline, and the brother's reaction is inappropriate. The author's refusal was based on realistic constraints that couldn't be overcome, and the brother didn't handle the situation well. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
