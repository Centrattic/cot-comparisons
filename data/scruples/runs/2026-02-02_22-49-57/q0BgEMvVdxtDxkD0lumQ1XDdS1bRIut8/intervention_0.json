I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The person is 23, from r/childfree, hates kids, smokes weed, and refuses to babysit their brother's kids last minute because they can't do it. The brother and his wife are upset, called them names, and ranted on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother asked two days before the cruise, which is a week long. The author has a job that allows them to work from home with weed, but their house isn't babyproof. They can't take time off because they're saving PTO for a trip. The brother's side wanted the kids in a safe environment with no weed. The author said no, leading to a yelling session and public shaming.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the request was last minute, the author has a valid reason (not enough time to make the house safe, work commitments, personal dislike of kids), and the brother's reaction was harsh. The author isn't obligated to help, especially since it's a sudden request and they have their own priorities. The fact that the brother is upset because of a five-year plan doesn't negate the author's right to say no. Also, the brother's wife is using the kids as leverage, which isn't fair. The author isn't in the wrong here. They clearly communicated their inability to help, and the brother's response was excessive. Answer B.\n"
