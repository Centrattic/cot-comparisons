I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The situation is that the brother asked two days before a cruise, which they planned for five years. The author is single, works from home, has a side business, and uses marijuana. They hate kids, their house isn't babyproofed, and they can't take time off work because they were saving PTO for a vacation. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author has a valid reason. The key points are the short notice, the author's job and work commitments, the house not being safe for kids, and the fact that the author doesn't like kids. Also, they weren't offered any payment, and the request is unrealistic given the time frame. The brother's side is upset because they had the trip planned for a long time, but they should have considered childcare before deciding to go on the cruise.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have a legitimate conflict. They can't just drop their work and rearrange their home last-minute. The brother's reaction of yelling and calling them names is also out of line. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when it's a significant personal sacrifice. The fact that the author is upfront about not liking kids adds to the reasonableness of their refusal. \n\nBut some might argue that family obligations matter, and maybe the author should have stepped up. However, the request was two days before the trip, which is very short notice. Also, the author's job and personal time off were already scheduled. The brother's planning ahead doesn't change the fact that they waited until the last minute to ask for help, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their refusal is justified due to the circumstances. The brother's anger and accusations are unwarranted. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
