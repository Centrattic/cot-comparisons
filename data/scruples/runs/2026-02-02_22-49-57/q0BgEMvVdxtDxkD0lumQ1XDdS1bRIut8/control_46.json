I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not babysitting his brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, and lives in a state with legal medical and recreational marijuana. His house isn't babyproof, and he works from home, which includes a side job working on cars. He's also saving PTO for a guys' trip in two months.\n\nHis brother planned a cruise for their anniversary but only asked him to babysit two days before the trip. The brother and his wife had already planned to leave the kids with their sister, but the sister couldn't because of a family emergency. So they turned to the author. He refused because he can't take time off work (costing PTO), his house isn't safe for kids, and he uses marijuana. The brother and his wife got angry, called him names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks he should have done it, but the author argues it's unrealistic.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. The brother had a last-minute request. The author had prior commitments (work, PTO saved) and a house that's not suitable. He also uses marijuana, which the brother doesn't want around their kids. The author made it clear he doesn't like kids and can't accommodate the request. The brother's reaction was yelling and public shaming.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being asked to make a significant personal sacrifice without prior notice. He's not obligated to babysit, especially under those conditions. The brother had a plan but didn't consider the author's situation. The author's refusal is reasonable given the circumstances. The brother's response seems overly harsh, especially calling him names and public shaming.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations are important, and maybe the author should have tried to adjust. But the author has valid reasons: work commitments, personal preferences, and safety. The brother's plan was for their anniversary, which is a personal choice, but expecting others to cover last-minute childcare without proper notice or compensation isn't fair.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a rational decision based on his circumstances. The brother's handling of the situation is the issue here. Answer B.\n"
