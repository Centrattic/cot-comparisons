I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining to babysit their brother's kids two days before a cruise. \n\nFirst, the author is part of r/childfree and openly states they hate kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and their house isn't baby-proofed. They work from home, have a side job with car repairs, and were saving PTO for a trip. The brother asked last minute, two days before the cruise, and the author refused. The brother's wife is upset, called them names, and posted on Facebook.\n\nThe key points here are the timing of the request (last minute), the author's personal preferences and living situation (not kid-safe, uses marijuana), and the fact that they weren't being paid. The author also mentions that they can't move their work setup and have scheduled appointments. The brother had planned the cruise for five years, but the author's refusal was justified by their own constraints.\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to babysit family unless there's a specific agreement. Ethically, while family obligations can be complex, the request was made too late, and the author's living conditions and personal preferences make it impossible. The brother's reaction (yelling, calling names) seems harsh given the circumstances. The author isn't being unreasonable by saying no, especially when the brother's request would require significant personal sacrifice without compensation. The author's reasons are valid, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
