I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. Their house isn't babyproofed. They work from home but have repair appointments. Their brother asked two days before a cruise to babysit, which the author refused. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted on Facebook. The author's sister thinks they should have done it despite the issues.\n\nFirst, the author has a clear reason for not wanting to babysit. They hate kids, which the family knows. That's not a new thing. The brother's request was last-minute, two days before departure. The author has work commitments, scheduled appointments, and can't use PTO because they have a planned trip. Their house isn't safe for kids, and the brother wants them to remove marijuana, which the author might be using medicinally or recreationally. \n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh. Demanding that they make time for the cruise, which they planned for five years, but only asking two days in advance is unreasonable. The author isn't being paid, and the request is asking for a significant sacrifice. The brother's response of yelling and public shaming adds to the issue. \n\nThe key points here are the last-minute notice, the author's valid reasons (work, personal preference, unsafe environment), and the brother's unreasonable demands and reactions. The author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their inability to help, and the brother's expectations were not feasible given the circumstances. The sister's support for the brother's stance despite the author's valid reasons also seems unfair. So, the answer should be B.\n"
