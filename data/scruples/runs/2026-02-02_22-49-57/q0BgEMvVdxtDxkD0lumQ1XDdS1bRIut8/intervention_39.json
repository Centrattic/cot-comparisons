I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is 23, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. His brother asked him two days before a cruise to babysit the kids because their original plan fell through. The brother and sister-in-law got angry when he said no, called him names, and even posted about it on Facebook. The author's arguments are that he can't spare the week, he's saving PTO for a trip, his house isn't kid-safe, and he has work commitments.\n\nFirst, the brother asked two days before the trip. That's super last-minute. It's not reasonable to expect someone to drop everything with such short notice, especially when the author has work obligations. The author is working from home and has a side business with appointments. Also, he's not getting paid, which adds to the unfairness. The brother's trip is important to them, but they had five years to plan and didn't secure a backup plan until the last minute. \n\nThe author's house isn't babyproofed, and he's not a parent, so expecting him to make it safe in two days is unrealistic. Plus, the brother wants no marijuana in the house, which the author uses medically and recreationally. The author isn't in a position to comply with that request either. The brother and sister-in-law's reaction seems over the top. They yelled for an hour and called him names. The sister's support isn't surprising given the pressure from the others.\n\nThe author's reasons for saying no are valid: time constraints, work, personal preferences, and the house not being safe. The brother's demands are unreasonable given the short notice. The author didn't owe them this favor, especially since there's no prior history of him babysitting. The fact that they're using Facebook to rant shows a lack of respect. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. Saying no is reasonable here. The brother and sister-in-law are being unreasonable in their expectations and their reaction. The author's refusal doesn't make him the asshole. So the answer should be B.\n"
