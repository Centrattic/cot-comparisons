I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The scenario is that the brother asked two days before a cruise, and the author has valid reasons: he hates kids, his house isn't safe, he's working from home, and he can't take time off. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called him names, and even posted about him on Facebook.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated his reasons for not being able to help. He's 23, works from home, has a side business with repair appointments, and his house isn't kid-friendly. Plus, he uses marijuana, which they wouldn't want around kids. He also mentions he has other plans (a guys trip) and can't use his PTO. \n\nThe brother and sister-in-law's reaction seems a bit harsh. They had the trip planned for five years, but asking last minute and expecting the author to drop everything without prior arrangement might not be fair. The author didn't agree to this beforehand, so being upset when he says no could be their own fault for not planning better. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to help, especially with the circumstances. He's not being selfish without reason; he's stating his limitations. The fact that they yelled at him and made Facebook rants shows they overreacted. The sister's opinion isn't the main issue here; the key is the author's right to say no without being labeled an asshole. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
