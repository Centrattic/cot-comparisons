I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The author is 23, part of a child-free community, hates kids, lives in a state where weed is legal and uses it, works from home, and has a side business with car repairs. His brother asked him two days before a planned cruise to take the kids temporarily because their sister couldn't due to a family emergency. The author says no because of work commitments, not wanting to use PTO, and the fact that his house isn't safe for kids. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called him names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. He clearly states his dislike for children, which is a personal preference. He's responsible for his own workload and has scheduled appointments. The brother's request came very late, giving no time to adjust. Also, the author's house isn't baby-proofed, which is a legitimate safety concern. The brother wanted the kids in a safe environment, which the author can't provide. The brother's side is asking for a week-long commitment without payment, which the author can't afford to give, especially since he's saving PTO for another trip. \n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh. Yelling for an hour and calling someone a drug addict is a strong response. The author isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially under those circumstances. The timing was poor, and the request was unrealistic given the short notice. The fact that the author has a valid reason for not being able to accommodate, plus the safety issues, supports his decision. It's also about personal boundaries. The author isn't the bad guy here; he's making a choice based on his own life and responsibilities. The brother's public shaming and the sister's expectation without considering the feasibility might indicate that the family isn't respecting the author's limits. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
