I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit his brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. That's a key point. They also live in a place where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't baby-proofed, which is a safety issue. They work from home, have a side business with car repairs, and can't take time off because they were saving PTO for a trip. \n\nThe brother asked two days before the cruise, which had been planned for five years. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author an asshole, and posted about it on Facebook. The author's sister is pressuring him too. The main issues here seem to be the short notice, the author's inability to meet the safety requirements, and the fact that the brother didn't plan ahead. \n\nThe author isn't being paid, which is a big factor. If someone expects you to take on a week of childcare without compensation, especially when you have your own work, that's a lot to ask. Plus, the author has legitimate safety concerns about their house. The brother's kids could be endangered if left in an unsafe environment. \n\nThe brother's reaction of yelling for an hour and calling the author a drug addict is also problematic. That's a hostile response. The author had valid reasons: not enough time, no payment, safety issues, and personal preferences. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't being unreasonable. They made a clear, honest response to a last-minute request that they couldn't fulfill. The blame here seems to shift more towards the brother for not planning ahead and for the harsh reaction. The author isn't the one in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
