I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the \"childfree\" community, and openly hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a place where marijuana is legal, and they smoke regularly. Their house isn't baby-proofed. They work from home and have a side business with repair appointments scheduled for the week.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, originally leaving the kids with their sister. But the sister had a family emergency and couldn't take them. Two days before the trip, they asked the author to babysit. The author said no, explaining they can't take time off work (using PTO for a planned guys' trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't cancel repair appointments. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister sides with them, but the author argues the request is unreasonable.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are family obligations, prior planning, and the feasibility of the request. The brother had a plan for a cruise that they worked on for five years. However, they waited until two days before the trip to ask for a backup plan, which is very short notice. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons: their house isn't safe, their work schedule, and personal dislike for kids. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially since they didn't plan ahead and are expecting the author to make significant sacrifices without compensation.\n\nIn many cases, family is expected to help in emergencies, but here it's a planned vacation. The brother should have considered alternative childcare options well in advance. The author isn't obligated to use their PTO, rearrange their work, and baby-proof a house on short notice. The brother's anger and public shaming seem disproportionate. The author's reasons are legitimate, so they're not in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
