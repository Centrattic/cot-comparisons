I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is being asked if they're a jerk for not babysitting their brother's kids. The key points here are the timing of the request, the person's personal situation, and their feelings about kids.\n\nFirst, the brother asked two days before the cruise. That's super short notice. The person isn't a parent or caregiver by any means\u2014they're 23, hate kids, and have a job where they work from home. Plus, they have their own work commitments, like car repair appointments. They can't just drop everything, especially since it's not paid, and they were saving PTO for another trip. \n\nThe brother's side is understandable\u2014they wanted to take a five-year planned trip. But they didn't plan ahead for childcare. The person's house isn't baby-proofed and they use marijuana, which the brother's family doesn't want around the kids. The request seems unrealistic given the time frame. The brother and his wife overreacted by yelling and calling them names, which isn't cool. The sister thinking the person should help doesn't change the fact that the request was last-minute and the person has valid reasons to say no.\n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong. They had legitimate reasons to decline, the request was poorly timed, and the other family's reaction was harsh. The answer should be B.\n"
