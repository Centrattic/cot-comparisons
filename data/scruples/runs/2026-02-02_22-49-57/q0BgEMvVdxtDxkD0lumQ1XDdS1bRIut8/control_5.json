I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids under the given circumstances.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of a child-free community, and really doesn't like kids. That's clear. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they use marijuana, which their brother would want to avoid if kids were present. The brother asked two days before the trip, which is super short notice. The author has work commitments and can't take time off without using PTO they need for a trip. They also can't move their work setup or cancel appointments.\n\nThe brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and the sister is pressuring him. The author feels it's unrealistic to ask them to throw out their weed and baby-proof in two days. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, family obligations can be tough, but the request was last-minute and the author has valid reasons: work, personal preferences, house safety, and health. They weren't given enough time to make adjustments. The brother's trip was planned for five years, but they should have arranged childcare earlier. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice their time and comfort, especially with the short notice and their own constraints. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially the yelling and public rants. \n\nThe key points are short notice, personal boundaries, and feasibility. The author isn't in the wrong here because they communicated their reasons and it's unreasonable to expect them to accommodate such a sudden and demanding request without proper notice or compensation. So the answer should be B.\n"
