I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The question is whether refusing to babysit their brother's kids makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author is 23, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. They have a job that allows marijuana use, and they work from home. They also have a side job fixing cars. The brother asked two days before a cruise for them to watch the kids, but the author can't because of work commitments, the house isn't kid-safe, and they were saving PTO for another trip. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted about them on Facebook.\n\nSo, the author's reasons: they hate kids, their house isn't safe, they have work that can't be moved, and they weren't being paid. The brother had planned the cruise for five years. But the request came last minute. The author isn't obligated to help, especially with such short notice. The brother's reaction seems harsh, given the author's valid constraints. The author also mentions they're part of a child-free community, which reinforces their stance.\n\nPossible angles: Is it unreasonable to ask family for help? Maybe, especially with such short notice and without compensation. The author's refusal is based on legitimate reasons. The brother's criticism about being a \"drug addict\" is a personal attack, which seems unfair. The author isn't in the wrong here. They can't be expected to rearrange their life for a last-minute request when they have their own plans and responsibilities. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
