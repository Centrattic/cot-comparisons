I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really dislikes kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. They work from home, have a side business working on cars, and have repair appointments scheduled. Their house isn't baby-proofed. \n\nThe brother asked them last minute to babysit for a week so they could go on a cruise they've planned for five years. The author refuses because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a guys' trip in two months), can't move their work setup, the house isn't safe for kids, and they don't want to get rid of their marijuana or redo their house. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted on Facebook. The sister is pressuring them too.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. \n\nThe author clearly stated their limitations: work commitments, not having a safe environment, personal preferences (hating kids, using marijuana). They were asked two days before the trip, which is a very short notice. The brother's request would require significant personal sacrifices from the author, like using PTO days they had saved. Also, the author isn't being paid, which could add to the unfairness.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's cruise is a family event they've waited five years for. But the timing and notice were poor. The author isn't obligated to help, especially with the short notice and their existing commitments. The brother's reaction (yelling, name-calling, public ranting) seems excessive, suggesting they didn't consider the author's situation.\n\nThe author made it clear they can't do it, so they aren't being unreasonable. The brother's side might feel let down, but the author isn't at fault for setting boundaries. The sister's support for watching isn't valid without considering the author's constraints. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their inability to help, and the brother's request was unreasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
