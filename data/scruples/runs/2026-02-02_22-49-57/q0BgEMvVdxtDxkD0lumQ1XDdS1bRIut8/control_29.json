I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The author is part of the childfree community and hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal and uses it, has a home that's not babyproofed, and works from home. His brother asked him two days before a cruise to take the kids, but the author couldn't because he has work commitments, PTO plans, and the house isn't safe. The brother and his wife were upset, called him names, and posted about him on Facebook. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. He's honest about hating kids and his home situation. He's also working from home, has a side business with repair appointments, and can't just move his work setup. The brother's request came very last minute, two days before the trip. The author is single, and the brother expects him to prioritize their family plans over his own commitments. \n\nThe brother's side is that they had the trip planned for five years and needed help. But the author's refusal isn't just about disliking kids; it's practical\u2014house safety, work, no payment. The brother is asking for a week-long commitment without compensating the author, which is a big ask. Also, the author's use of marijuana is a red flag for them, so they want a safe environment. But the author's home isn't safe, which he's upfront about.\n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh. Yelling for an hour, calling him a drug addict, and using social media to rant. The sister's opinion isn't enough to justify the brother's actions. The author isn't in a position where he can realistically take on the responsibility, and the request was unreasonable given the timing and his personal circumstances. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he gave a clear, honest reason for declining. The brother's expectations were unrealistic and they didn't consider the author's constraints. The author's responsibilities and personal boundaries are valid here.\n"
