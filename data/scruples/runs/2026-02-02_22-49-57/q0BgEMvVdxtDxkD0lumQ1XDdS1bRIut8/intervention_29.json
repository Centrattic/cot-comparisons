I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The situation is that the brother asked two days before a cruise, and the author said no due to various reasons like not having a safe house, work commitments, and personal dislike for kids. The brother and his wife got angry and called the author names, even ranting on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's side. They mentioned hating kids and the family knowing that. They're 23, single, live in a place where marijuana is legal, which isn't kid-safe. They have work commitments (car repair appointments and a job they work from home) that they can't cancel. Also, the brother's request came last minute, two days before the trip, which makes it hard to adjust plans. The author was saving PTO for a guys' trip in two months, so using it now would mess up future plans.\n\nOn the other side, the brother had a planned cruise for five years, and the sister couldn't help because of a family emergency. They needed someone to watch the kids, and the author is their sibling. But the request is last-minute and the author's situation doesn't allow it. The brother's reaction was yelling and calling the author names, which is harsh. Also, expecting the author to throw out their marijuana and make the house safe in two days is a lot to ask, especially given the short notice.\n\nThe key points here are the last-minute request, the author's valid reasons (work, home not safe, personal preferences), and the brother's unreasonable expectations. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when it's a sudden request and they have their own commitments. The brother's reaction seems over the top, maybe not considering the author's circumstances. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They had legitimate reasons to decline, and the brother should have understood that. The answer should be B.\n"
