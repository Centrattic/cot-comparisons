I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not babysitting their brothers' kids. The author is a 23-year-old from the r/childfree subreddit, so they're probably not a fan of kids. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it frequently. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home with a side business in car repairs.\n\nThe situation is that their brother asked them to watch the kids last minute because their sister couldn't do it. The author declined because they can't take time off work, don't want to give up their vacation plans, and their house isn't suitable for kids. The brother and sister-in-law got angry and called them names, even ranting on Facebook.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the request was last minute (two days before), the author has valid reasons (work commitments, house safety, personal preferences), and the brother's reaction was harsh. The fact that the author is upfront about hating kids but the family knew that beforehand might be important. Also, the brother had planned the trip for five years, but asking for last-minute childcare isn't really fair if they didn't plan ahead. The author isn't being paid, which adds to the burden. The brother's wife wanted no drugs in the house, which the author can't comply with easily. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They gave a reasonable refusal. The brother and sister-in-law should have had a backup plan. The author's reasons are legitimate. The answer should be B.\n"
