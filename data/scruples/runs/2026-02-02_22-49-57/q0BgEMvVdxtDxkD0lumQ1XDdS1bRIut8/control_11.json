I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the askreddit post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they use marijuana regularly, which is legal where they live. Their job allows them to work from home, but they have a side business working on cars. They have scheduled repair appointments during the week the brother wants them to babysit.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, but originally wanted to leave the kids with their sister. When the sister couldn't due to a family emergency, they asked the author two days before the trip. The author says no because they can't take time off work (using PTO they saved for a guys trip), their house isn't safe, and they can't move their work setup. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have helped.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author has a legitimate reason to refuse\u2014personal preferences (hating kids), work commitments, and the house not being suitable. The brother asked very last minute, which is inconvenient. The author isn't being paid, and the request is unrealistic given their work schedule. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them names and public shaming on Facebook.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, family obligations can be tricky, but the author isn't obligated to help unless there's a prior agreement. They clearly state their reasons are valid. The brother's request is unreasonable given the timing and circumstances. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They made a choice based on their own life and responsibilities, which is their right. The brother's reaction is more problematic. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
