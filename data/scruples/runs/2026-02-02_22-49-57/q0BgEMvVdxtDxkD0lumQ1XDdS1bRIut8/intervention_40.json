I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is that the brother asked two days before a cruise, which they'd planned for five years. The author is 23, in a childfree subreddit, hates kids, lives in a house that's not babyproofed, uses marijuana, and can't take time off work. They said no, and the brother and his wife got angry, called them names, and posted on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid reason to say no. They mentioned their dislike of children, their house isn't safe, and they have work commitments. Plus, they're not being paid for this. The brother asked last minute, which is a problem. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially with their own time and space. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother had a long-planned trip. But they should have planned childcare earlier. The fact that their sister had an emergency and couldn't take the kids is a factor, but maybe the brother should have considered other options before the last minute. Also, the author's refusal isn't out of malice but practical reasons. The brother's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling, calling names, Facebook rants. That's more on the brother and sister-in-law's side. \n\nThe key points are the author's justification for saying no, the brother's poor planning, and the lack of support for the author's situation. The author isn't obligated to help unless there's a prior agreement. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
