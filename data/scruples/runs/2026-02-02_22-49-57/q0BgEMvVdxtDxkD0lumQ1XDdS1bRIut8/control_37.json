I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit his brother's kids. Let me break down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. He's a single guy who works from home but has a side business working on cars. He hates kids, and his house isn't babyproofed. His brother planned a cruise for their anniversary and wanted him to take the kids two days before the trip. The brother and sister-in-law then yelled at him and called him names when he refused. The author argues he can't spare the time, can't afford to use PTO for this instead of a planned trip, and that making his house safe isn't feasible in two days.\n\nSo, the main factors here: the brother asked last minute, the author has valid reasons like work commitments, his house isn't safe for kids, and he's not being paid. Also, the parents are upset because they've had the trip planned for five years. But is the author obligated to help?\n\nTypically, family obligations can vary. If someone asks for help last minute without prior arrangement, and the person has valid reasons to say no, that's understandable. The parents might feel entitled to family support, but the author isn't in a position to help. The fact that they criticized him for having marijuana, which is legal in the state, might be an overreach. Also, using Facebook to rant about him and the sister pushing him despite the impracticality could be their fault for not planning ahead or understanding his situation.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if he clearly communicated his inability to help and the reasons were legitimate. The parents' reaction seems excessive, especially yelling for an hour and public shaming. The author's priorities (work, personal time) are valid, and he's not responsible for their last-minute planning. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
