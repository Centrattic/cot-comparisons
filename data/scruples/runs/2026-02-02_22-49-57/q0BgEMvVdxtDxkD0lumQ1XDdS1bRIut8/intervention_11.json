I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The situation is that the brother asked two days before a planned cruise, which they had scheduled for five years. The author, who is 23, dislikes kids, uses marijuana (which is legal in their state), and their house isn't kid-safe. They also have work commitments and a planned guys' trip coming up.\n\nFirst, the brother's request came very last minute. Two days' notice isn't ideal for anyone to prepare, especially if the author has prior commitments. The author has a legitimate job where they work from home, so asking them to take time off for PTO that they had already saved might not be feasible. Plus, they have repair appointments scheduled, which are part of their side business. \n\nThe brother and his wife were unreasonable by yelling and calling the author names. Their response was harsh, especially considering the short notice and the author's valid reasons. The author's house isn't safe for kids, which is a valid safety concern. Also, the author's dislike for children is mentioned, so expecting them to care for kids against their will isn't fair. \n\nThe parents also wanted the author to throw out their marijuana, which is legal in their state. The author isn't obligated to accommodate that unless it's part of a mutual agreement, which wasn't in place here. The parents' reaction on Facebook and the sister's judgment add to the pressure, but that doesn't make the author wrong for saying no.\n\nIn terms of family obligations, there's no legal requirement to babysit unless it's part of a prior agreement. The author has their own life and priorities. Their refusal isn't selfish if they have valid reasons. The key points are the last-minute request, the author's inability to meet the demands, and the parents' excessive reaction. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
