I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, really hates kids, and uses marijuana regularly. The brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, but the author's place isn't safe, he's got work commitments, and he doesn't want to give up his PTO for this. The brother and sister-in-law got angry and called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The author made it clear he doesn't like kids and his house isn't set up for them. The brother's request came last minute without much notice. The author has valid reasons: work schedule, house safety, personal habits with marijuana. Also, they mentioned they can't pay him, so he's not getting compensated for using his PTO. \n\nThe brother had planned the cruise for five years, but asking a sibling to watch the kids two days beforehand is a big ask. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when it's such a short notice and it conflicts with his personal plans and work. The fact that the author is using his PTO for a trip later shows he's managing his own time. \n\nThe brother and his wife's reaction seems harsh. Yelling for an hour and calling the author names is over the top. The sister's expectation might be influenced by traditional family roles, but the author's situation is legitimate. The author isn't being selfish; he's setting boundaries based on his capabilities and personal life. \n\nI think the key points are the last-minute request, the author's valid reasons for refusal, and the disproportionate response from the brother. The author isn't in the wrong here because he's being honest about his limitations and not willing to sacrifice his time and resources without proper notice or compensation. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
