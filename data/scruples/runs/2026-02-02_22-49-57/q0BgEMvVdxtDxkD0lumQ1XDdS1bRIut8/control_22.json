I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me start by looking at the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a place where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home with a side job working on cars. They have scheduled repair appointments and can't take time off because they were saving PTO for a guys' trip. \n\nThe brother asked two days before the cruise, which they had planned for five years, to watch the kids. The author said no because they couldn't rearrange their work, couldn't make their house safe, and the brother wanted them to get rid of their marijuana. The brother and wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have helped.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the responsibilities and boundaries. The author clearly communicated their dislike for kids and their current situation. They have valid reasons: work commitments, an unsafe environment, and personal use of marijuana. The brother asked last minute, which is a short notice. The author isn't obligated to help, especially without compensation. The brother's reaction seems harsh, given the author's constraints. The author isn't being selfish; they're setting boundaries based on their capabilities. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in some families to help out, but the author has legitimate reasons. The brother's plan was long-term, yet they waited until the last minute to ask for help. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but based on real limitations. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
