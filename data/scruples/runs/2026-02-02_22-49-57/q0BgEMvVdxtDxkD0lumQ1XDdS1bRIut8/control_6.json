I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. **The Author's Position**: The author is 23, lives in a state where medical and recreational marijuana is legal, and uses it regularly. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home, which might be affected if they had to move their setup. They also have a side business with repair appointments. They hate kids and made that clear through their presence in a child-free Reddit community.\n\n2. **The Sibling's Request**: The brother wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, planned for five years. They asked the author two days before the trip, after their original plan (sister's house) fell through. The author refused, leading to conflict. The parents wanted a drug-free environment and a safe house for the kids, which the author couldn't provide.\n\n3. **Author's Arguments**: The author feels that the request is unreasonable because they can't rearrange their work, can't babyproof the house in two days, and can't give up their PTO for the cruise. They also mention that they aren't paid and the sacrifice isn't worth the $900 trip cost. The parents criticized them for being a \"drug addict\" and a \"useless asshole.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider family responsibilities. Family often expects some level of support, but there's a balance. The author has valid reasons: dislike of kids, unsafe living conditions, workload, and personal use of marijuana. The brother's request came last minute, which complicates things. The author's refusal isn't out of meanness but practical impossibility. However, the parents might feel slighted, especially since it's a significant trip. The author isn't legally or ethically obligated to help, but socially, there's a grey area. The parents' reaction (calling names, ranting) is harsh. The author's refusal isn't the asshole move here; the parents' lack of planning and unreasonable demands might be. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
