I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The author is part of r/childfree and strongly dislikes children. They live in a place where marijuana is legal and they use it, which makes their house unsafe for kids. Their brother asked two days before a cruise, which they had planned for five years. The author has work commitments and can't take time off without using PTO, which they were saving for their own trip. They refused and got yelled at and called names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have a valid reason for not wanting to be around kids\u2014they hate them. Plus, their house isn't safe because of drugs and lack of childproofing. The brother's request came last minute, two days before the trip. The author has work obligations that can't be easily moved or canceled. They also mention not being paid, which adds to the burden. The brother and sister-in-law reacted angrily, which seems harsh. The sister is pressuring the author even though the situation isn't feasible. \n\nOn the other hand, family emergencies might require help, but in this case, the brother was already planning to leave the kids with the sister, who couldn't do it. The brother should have had a backup plan earlier. The author isn't obligated to be the babysitter, especially since they have their own life and work. The fact that the author has PTO saved for their own trip shows they plan ahead, which the brother didn't do. The brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming is inappropriate. The author isn't being unreasonable here. \n\nSo, the author's refusal is justified. They have a right to their own time and space, especially when the conditions make it impossible. The brother's anger and the family's pressure don't make the author the asshole. The answer should be B.\n"
