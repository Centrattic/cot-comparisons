I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person described in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the person is 23, single, works from home, and has a side business working on cars. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they frequently use it. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a lot of work commitments. The brother asked two days before a planned cruise (a five-year plan) to watch the kids, but the person refused. The brother accuses them of being a drug addict and an asshole, and the sister is pressuring them as well.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The person has a known dislike for kids, which the family is aware of. The request was last-minute, and they have existing work obligations that can't be canceled. They're not being paid, and the brother's demand to remove all marijuana and make the house kid-safe is a big ask in two days. Also, the person has PTO saved for a trip, which the brother didn't consider.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the person isn't obligated to help unless there's a prior agreement. The brother's last-minute request without considering the helper's circumstances seems unreasonable. The fact that the person has valid work reasons and the house isn't safe adds to the difficulty. The brother's reaction, yelling and public shaming, seems harsh. The person isn't the asshole here because they're being honest about their limitations. So the answer is B.\n"
