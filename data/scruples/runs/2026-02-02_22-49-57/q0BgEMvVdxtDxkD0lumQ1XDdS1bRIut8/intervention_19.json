I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really dislikes kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home with a side job fixing cars. They were asked two days before the cruise to watch the kids, which they refused. They mention they can't take time off work, can't move their setup, and the house isn't safe. The brother and his wife got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister is pressuring them too.\n\nNow, considering the situation, I need to assess if the author is at fault. The key points are the timing (last-minute request), the author's personal circumstances (work, living situation, personal preferences), and the fact that the request is unreasonable. The brother had planned the trip for five years, but asking for help two days in advance might be unreasonable. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons\u2014work commitments, unsuitable living conditions, and not being paid. Also, the author's dislike for kids is mentioned, which is a personal choice. The brother's reaction (yelling, calling names) seems excessive. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they had legitimate reasons to decline. They made their stance clear and the request was too short notice. The brother's reaction is over the top. So the answer should be B.\n"
