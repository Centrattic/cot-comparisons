I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit his brother's kids. The key points here are the timing of the request, the author's personal circumstances, and the brother's reaction.\n\nFirst, the brother asked two days before the cruise. That's really short notice. If you have a job and other commitments, it's hard to rearrange everything last minute. The author mentions he works from home but has repair appointments scheduled. Plus, he's saving PTO for a trip in two months. That seems like a legitimate reason to not be able to take time off.\n\nThen there's the house safety issue. The author's house isn't babyproofed, and he uses marijuana, which the brother doesn't want around the kids. The author can't just babyproof his house in two days, especially if he's not used to having kids there. Also, moving his work setup to another house isn't feasible. That's another valid point.\n\nThe brother and his wife yelled at him for an hour and called him names. That's pretty harsh. The author clearly explained why he couldn't help, and instead of respecting his decision, they attacked him. Their reaction seems over the top. The sister's opinion that he should watch the kids doesn't change the fact that the request was unreasonable.\n\nThe fact that the author is in a state where marijuana is legal might be a red herring here. The issue isn't about the law but about the brother's preferences. Also, the author's dislike of kids is a personal choice, but it's not necessarily a flaw. People can have different priorities.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The request was last-minute, the author had valid reasons (work, house safety, personal preference), and the brother's response was hostile. The author isn't obligated to help under those circumstances. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
