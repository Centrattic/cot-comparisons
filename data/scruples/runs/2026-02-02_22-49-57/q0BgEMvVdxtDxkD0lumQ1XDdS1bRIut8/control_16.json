I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't babyproofed. They work from home and have a side job fixing cars.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, but their sister couldn't take the kids because of a family emergency. Two days before the trip, they asked the author to babysit. The author said no because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a guys' trip in two months), their house isn't safe, and they can't move their work setup. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have helped, but the author argues it's unrealistic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the brother gave very little notice (two days) and expected the author to drop their plans and accommodate. The author's reasons for declining are valid: work commitments, personal safety issues with the house, their dislike of kids, and the fact that the brother isn't paying them. Also, the brother's reaction (yelling, calling names, Facebook rants) seems excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in family to help out in emergencies or important events. But here, it's a planned trip for five years, not an emergency. The brother should have had a backup plan. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when it's a significant sacrifice. The brother's demands (throwing out marijuana, babyproofing in two days) are impractical and invasive.\n\nThe key points are the lack of notice, the author's legitimate reasons for refusal, and the unreasonable demands from the brother. The author isn't in the wrong because they clearly communicated their inability to help and the brother's response was overly harsh. The answer should be B (No).\n"
