Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is a woman in a 5-year relationship. She's struggling financially, can't afford meat often, and isn't a good cook. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks if she can have a portion, but he says no. Later, he gives her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. Then he tells her to clean up the dishes, even though she had already done the dishes earlier and he had cooked. He pushes her and restrains her, leading her to snap at him. She calls him out for being unkind, and he yells at her, calling her names.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Financial Situation**: The author can't afford to cook meals often, so relying on her boyfriend makes sense. However, he's in a better financial position. The fact that he cooked for himself but gave her leftovers might be seen as not supportive, especially since she needed proper meals.\n\n2. **Expectation of Kindness**: The author expects her boyfriend to cook for both of them, not just himself. He gave her leftovers, which she points out are barely enough. She feels that true kindness would have been cooking for both. This seems reasonable because if you're in a relationship, mutual support is expected. However, the boyfriend might have had his own reasons for not cooking for her, maybe not thinking she wanted to eat or not considering her situation.\n\n3. **Physical Restraint and Anger**: The boyfriend pushed and restrained her. That's a red flag. Physical aggression is never acceptable in a relationship. His reaction to her expressing her feelings by shutting the door violently and calling her names is also concerning. Emotional abuse is a serious issue here.\n\n4. **Communication and Respect**: The author's frustration is understandable. She's in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally. She might feel used or unappreciated. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to share his meal, then later acting like she should be grateful for leftovers, and then using physical force\u2014shows a lack of respect.\n\n5. **Cultural or Relationship Norms**: Depending on cultural background, some might expect shared responsibilities, but the physical restraint crosses a line regardless of culture. The boyfriend's actions suggest a power imbalance where he feels he can control her actions, which is problematic.\n\nNow, considering all these points: The author's anger stems from being treated unfairly, not cooking herself meals due to financial constraints, and facing physical abuse when expressing her needs. The boyfriend's actions include physical aggression and emotional manipulation (calling her names), which are serious. The author standing up for herself after being pushed is a reaction to abuse, which isn't her fault. \n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to share his meal and then expecting her to clean up, especially after physically restraining her, indicates toxic behavior. The author is justified in feeling mistreated and expressing her frustration. Her outburst, while maybe harsh, is a response to the boyfriend's inappropriate actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
