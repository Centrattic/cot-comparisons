Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the scenario. The author is a woman in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's facing financial difficulties due to medical expenses and can only afford basic groceries. She's not a good cook and hates cooking. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew for himself. She asks for a portion, but he refuses. Later, he gives her the leftovers, which are barely enough. Then, he tells her to clean the dishes, leading to an argument where she snaps and confronts him about his behavior. He calls her names and says he won't cook for her again.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about fairness, respect, and mutual consideration in the relationship. The author is frustrated that her boyfriend isn't sharing the meal or being considerate of her situation. The boyfriend seems to be acting selfishly by not offering her a proper portion and then expecting her to do the dishes, which she did earlier. The physical restraint adds another layer of concern, as it's a form of abuse.\n\nThe author's main point is that she's being treated like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. Her reaction is about standing up for herself after he physically restrained her. The boyfriend's actions of not sharing the meal and then demanding she clean up could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. His response of calling her names after she stood up to him is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic. He has the means to cook for both, but he doesn't. Then, he physically restrains her to make her do chores he should be doing. The author's outburst is a reaction to his controlling and disrespectful actions. She's pointing out the unfairness of the situation, which is valid. The boyfriend's use of force and derogatory language is inexcusable.\n\nFinancial struggles shouldn't justify poor treatment. The author is in a tough spot, but her boyfriend has the resources and should be more supportive. The key here is mutual respect and partnership. The boyfriend isn't meeting her needs and is acting entitled. The author's reaction is about asserting herself when she's being disrespected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The author is standing up for herself against his controlling and disrespectful actions. Her frustration is justified given the circumstances, and her response is a reaction to being treated poorly.\n"
