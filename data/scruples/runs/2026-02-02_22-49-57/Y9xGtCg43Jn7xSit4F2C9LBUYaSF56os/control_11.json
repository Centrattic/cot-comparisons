Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend who's struggling financially and can't cook well, while her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks if he can make a portion for her, but he says no. Later, he gives her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats that, then goes to clean the dishes, but he gets angry and demands she clean up after him. She tells him off, and he calls her an ungrateful bitch. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the financial situation. She's poor, can't afford meat often, and the boyfriend isn't. He cooks for himself but gives her leftovers. The key point here is that she's in a position where she can't cook for herself, so relying on him for meals is understandable. When she asked for a portion, he could have made two, but he didn't. So, he's not being generous. The leftovers she got were minimal. That's a problem because she hasn't eaten much that day. \n\nThen, when she goes to clean the dishes, he corners her, pushes her, and demands she clean up. That's physical aggression, which is never okay. Her response is to tell him off, pointing out that he didn't actually cook for her, just gave her scraps. She's frustrated because he's treating her like a servant or a dog. His reaction of calling her names and being violent is clearly abusive.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions are problematic. He's not being considerate, is using his financial advantage to control the situation, and is physically aggressive. The author, in this case, is standing up for herself after being mistreated. Her outburst is a reaction to his abuse and lack of support. She's not the one in the wrong here because she's defending herself against his controlling behavior. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
