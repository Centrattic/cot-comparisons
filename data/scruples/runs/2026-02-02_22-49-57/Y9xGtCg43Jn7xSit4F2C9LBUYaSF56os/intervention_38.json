Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author mentions she's a terrible cook, hates cooking, and is currently in financial trouble, so she can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta. Meat is expensive, so she can only have it every two weeks. Her boyfriend isn't in financial trouble. She asked him to cook a portion for her when he made a meat stew, but he said no. Later, he gave her the leftovers, which were just a couple of spoonfuls. Then he told her to clean the dishes, even though she had already done that. She got angry, told him off, and he called her names. She's upset because she feels he's not being generous and is treating her poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a difficult financial situation, which affects her ability to cook meals. Her boyfriend, who isn't struggling financially, chose to cook for himself but gave her leftovers. She's asking for a portion when he cooks, which seems reasonable, but he refused. Then, after she eats his leftovers, he expects her to clean up, even though he cooked. She's frustrated that he's not being kind by making both of them dinner, and instead, he's giving her scraps and then demanding she clean up.\n\nThere's also the physical aspect where he pushed and restrained her, which is a form of abuse. That's a serious red flag in any relationship. The author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances. She's standing up for herself when he's being unfair. The boyfriend's behavior seems disrespectful and controlling. He's not only taking advantage of her financial situation but also using physical intimidation. The author's outburst is a response to being treated unkindly, and she's pointing out the hypocrisy in his actions.\n\nNow, the key points: Is the author in the wrong? The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to make a portion for her despite having enough ingredients, giving her leftovers, and then demanding she clean up\u2014seem to be a pattern of behavior where he's not contributing equally and is taking advantage. The author's response is a reaction to being mistreated. She's not the one initiating the conflict here; she's pushing back against his poor treatment. The boyfriend's use of physical force is a major issue, making this a case of him being in the wrong. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
