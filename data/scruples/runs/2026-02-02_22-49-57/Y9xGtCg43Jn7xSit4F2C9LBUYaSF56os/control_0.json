  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend where the boyfriend cooked a stew, gave her leftovers, and then expected her to clean up. The author got upset because she felt treated like a dog or a roommate, and she snapped back.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, but she couldn't cook because of her situation. He said no when she asked for a portion, then gave her the leftovers. She ate it because she was hungry. Then he expected her to clean up, got angry, pushed her, and called her names. The author yelled back, which led to the argument.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's actions. He had the means to cook for both, but only for himself. Then, when he gave her leftovers, it was barely enough. Expecting her to clean up after him, especially after he didn't cook for her, seems unfair. Also, his physical restraint and aggression are problematic. The author's frustration is understandable given her financial struggles and his lack of support. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially when he was being abusive. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
