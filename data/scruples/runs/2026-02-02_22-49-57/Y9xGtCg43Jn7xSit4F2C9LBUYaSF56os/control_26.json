Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the boyfriend cooking a stew, giving the author a small portion of his leftovers, and then getting angry when she doesn't clean up immediately. The author then confronts him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is struggling financially, can't afford meat often, and is trying to manage with limited groceries. The boyfriend is cooking for himself when the author asks for a portion. He says no, but later gives her the leftovers. The author is clearly in a tough spot, not having eaten a proper meal all day, so she's grateful for the leftovers, even though it's minimal.\n\nThen, the boyfriend insists she cleans the dishes immediately, even though it was his meal. He gets aggressive, pushing her and using derogatory language. The author responds by pointing out the lack of generosity and the unequal treatment. She's frustrated because she feels treated like a servant or a dog, not a partner.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and support are key. The boyfriend's actions seem dismissive and controlling. He didn't cook for her, just gave leftovers after she asked. His reaction to her needing to take a break to shower before cleaning up is unreasonable. The physical aggression is also a red flag. The author's outburst is a reaction to being mistreated, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nFinancial struggles can add stress, but that doesn't justify the boyfriend's behavior. The author is in a vulnerable position, and the boyfriend isn't supporting her as a partner. Instead, he's adding to her stress with his actions. The author's frustration is valid because she's being treated poorly, and her response is a stand-up moment against unfair treatment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and words are the main issues here. The answer should be B.\n"
