Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their relationship with their boyfriend. The key points are:\n\nFirst, the author is struggling financially and can't afford proper meals. They hate cooking and aren't good at it. Their boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a stew for himself. The author asks for a portion, but he says no. Later, after eating, he offers the leftovers, which are minimal. The author eats them but then is forced to clean the dishes by the boyfriend. The author snaps back, leading to an argument.\n\nThe main issue here seems to be about the boyfriend's behavior. He's cooking for himself and giving leftovers, which the author feels is not generous. Then he physically restrains her to make her clean up, which is aggressive. The author's outburst is a reaction to being treated poorly, especially in a relationship where they've been together for five years. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share a meal he's making, being ungenerous, and using physical force\u2014seem like the bigger issues. The author's response, while maybe confrontational, is a reaction to being mistreated. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning here. The author is defending their right to be treated with respect, not like a servant or a dog. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend is. The answer should be B.\n"
