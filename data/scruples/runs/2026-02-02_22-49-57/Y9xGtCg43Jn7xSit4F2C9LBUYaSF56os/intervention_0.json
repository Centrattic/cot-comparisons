Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the author feels disrespected by their boyfriend's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is struggling financially, can't afford to cook much, and relies on their boyfriend for meals. The boyfriend cooks a stew for himself, gives her leftovers, and then expects her to clean up. The author then confronts him, leading to an argument.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, giving leftovers, then demanding she cleans up. The author's response: pointing out the unfairness and standing up for herself. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I need to decide if that's correct. \n\nConsidering the boyfriend's behavior: he's in a better financial position, didn't offer to cook a meal that includes her, and then treats the cleanup as her responsibility. The author's reaction is about feeling treated poorly, not just about the food. The confrontation happened when she was hungry, which adds stress.\n\nThe boyfriend's response was aggressive, pushing her and calling her names. The author's outburst was in response to that aggression. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and consideration are important. The boyfriend's actions seem selfish and disrespectful, especially given the financial disparity. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. \n\nThe key question is whether the author overstepped by lashing out. While her tone might have been harsh, the underlying issue is valid. The boyfriend's behavior is the root cause here. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself in that situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
