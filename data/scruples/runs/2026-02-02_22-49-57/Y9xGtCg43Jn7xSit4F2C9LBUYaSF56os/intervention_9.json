Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions she's not good at cooking, hates it, and due to medical expenses, can't afford much beyond basics like bread, milk, and pasta. Meat is a luxury she can only get every two weeks. \n\nTonight, her boyfriend, who isn't financially struggling, cooks a meat stew. She asks for a portion since he was already cooking, but he says no. Later, after eating his own meal, he offers her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She's hungry and takes them. Then he corners her in the kitchen to make her clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She tells him she's done the dishes before and he was cooking this time. He gets angry, pushes her, restrains her, and yells at her. She snaps back, pointing out he didn't actually cook for her, just gave her leftovers, and calls him out for treating her like a dog. He calls her names and says he won't cook for her again.\n\nSo, the author is asking if she's at fault. The user thinks she's not, but wants to know what I think. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, financial situation: She can't afford to cook often, especially meat. He's in a better position. When she asks for a portion when he's cooking, he says no. That's a bit odd, especially since he had enough for two. Maybe he didn't want to share, but that's unkind. Then, after she eats the leftovers, he makes her clean up. Even though he was the one cooking, so the dishes should be his responsibility. But he's making her do it, which is unfair.\n\nThe escalation: He uses physical force (pushing, restraining), which is a red flag. That's abuse, regardless of the situation. Then she confronts him, points out the unfairness. He yells and calls her names.\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, she's not wrong to be upset. He's treating her like a servant, expecting her to do dishes after he cooked, even though he didn't cook for her. His actions (physical abuse) are clearly wrong, but the question is whether she's at fault for speaking up. \n\nHe had it coming by being controlling and abusive. She's asserting herself, which is a healthy response. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
