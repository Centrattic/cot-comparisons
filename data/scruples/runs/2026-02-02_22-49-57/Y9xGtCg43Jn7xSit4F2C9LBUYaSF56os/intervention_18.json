Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a financial hardship, can't afford to cook much, and their boyfriend makes a stew but only for himself. The author asks for a portion, but he refuses. Then, after eating most of it, he gives her the leftovers, which are barely enough. She then gets asked to clean up, but she's already done that. He pushes her and yells, and she snaps back, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe author is frustrated because the boyfriend isn't being generous. He cooked for himself, gave her scraps, then expects her to clean up. The author's outburst is about feeling treated unfairly and not like a partner. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expressing that frustration.\n\nLooking at the situation, the boyfriend's actions seem controlling and disrespectful. He's in a better financial position, yet expects her to cook despite her inability, gives her minimal leftovers, and then physically confronts her. The author's reaction is a defense of her own dignity. She's not taking the abuse silently. Her statement about not being his dog or roommate is about asserting her worth in the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is toxic\u2014using emotional and physical control. The author's outburst is a reaction to being mistreated. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
