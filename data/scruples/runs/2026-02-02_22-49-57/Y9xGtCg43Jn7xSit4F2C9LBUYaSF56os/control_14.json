Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The woman is struggling financially, can't cook well, and relies on her boyfriend for meals. The boyfriend cooks a stew for himself, gives her leftovers, and then expects her to clean up. The woman feels disrespected and compares being treated like a dog or a roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend is in a better financial position. He cooks for himself, gives her leftovers, which she eats because she's hungry. Then he expects her to clean up, which she did earlier. He pushes her, which is physical abuse. She loses her temper and tells him off, leading to an argument.\n\nThe main issue here is the boyfriend's behavior. He gives her an inadequate meal, then demands she cleans up, uses physical force, and calls her names. That's abusive and disrespectful. The woman's reaction is a response to his actions. She's standing up for herself after being mistreated. \n\nThe woman's financial situation is a key factor. She can't afford to cook properly, so relying on her boyfriend makes sense. The boyfriend's refusal to make a proper meal for her and his aggressive behavior are problematic. The fact that he's not in financial trouble adds to the imbalance here. \n\nThe woman isn't in the wrong for expressing her frustration. She's had enough of being treated poorly. The boyfriend's actions (pushing, anger, not cooking properly) are the main issues. The woman's outburst is a reaction to cumulative mistreatment, not just the immediate incident. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here. The woman is justified in standing up for herself, especially given the context of financial hardship and past mistreatment.\n"
