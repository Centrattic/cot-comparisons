Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author is in a 5-year relationship. She's struggling financially, can't afford much beyond basics like bread, milk, and pasta. Meat is a luxury she can only afford every two weeks. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew for himself. She asks him for a portion, but he refuses. Later, he gives her leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats them because she's hungry. Then, when she tries to put the dish in the sink, he corners her, demands she clean the dishes, and gets aggressive, even pushing her. She snaps back, leading to an argument where she calls out his lack of kindness. He yells at her and says he'll never cook for her again.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's actions. He refuses to share his meal despite having enough ingredients, gives her minimal leftovers, and then physically restrains her for cleaning the dishes. That's a clear case of physical aggression and control. The author's response is to stand up to him, pointing out the unfairness. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is abusive. Physical aggression is never acceptable. The author is reacting to being treated poorly, not just in this instance but in the context of ongoing issues (like not cooking for her properly, giving leftovers). She's standing up for herself when he's being controlling. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions are the issue, not her for calling out his behavior.\n"
