Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cooks for himself and gives the author leftovers, which she eats. He then demands she cleans up, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author's main grievance is about being treated like a dog. She's in a tough financial situation, can't cook well, and relies on her boyfriend for meals. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a stew, gives her leftovers, and then expects her to do the dishes. She resists, leading to a physical confrontation. \n\nThe key points here: 1) Financial disparity\u2014she can't afford proper groceries, he can. 2) He cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, but didn't offer to cook for her. 3) He physically pushed her when she refused to clean immediately. 4) She snapped back, leading to his anger and accusations.\n\nI need to assess if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking for himself, giving leftovers without offering to cook for her, physically restraining her\u2014seem problematic. Emotional abuse is a red flag here. The author's reaction was a response to being mistreated. She's in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally. \n\nThe boyfriend's demand for her to clean the dishes, especially after physically pushing her, crosses into abusive behavior. The author's frustration is understandable given the circumstances. Her statement about not being his dog is a reasonable boundary. The boyfriend's response of calling her a \"b*tch\" and threatening to not cook again is toxic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. The boyfriend's actions are abusive and controlling. The author's financial struggles don't justify his behavior; instead, they highlight an imbalance in the relationship. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. The author's response was a result of being mistreated and standing up for herself.\n"
