  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The situation involves a boyfriend and his girlfriend dealing with financial issues and household responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has medical expenses and can't afford much food. She's not a good cook and hates cooking. Her boyfriend, who's not in financial trouble, cooks a stew for himself and gives her leftovers. She ends up eating just a bit. Then he demands she clean the dishes, even though she had already cleaned them before. He gets aggressive, pushing her and calling her names.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's behavior. He cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, then expected her to clean up without making any effort to help her. The girlfriend, feeling disrespected, confronts him. The boyfriend's actions\u2014pushing her, being violent, and expecting her to clean up without any reciprocation\u2014seem abusive and unfair. The girlfriend's response is a reaction to his mistreatment and lack of support, especially given her financial struggles.\n\nThe boyfriend's entitlement to have her clean up after him, despite him not cooking for her, is problematic. The girlfriend is standing up for herself, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's use of physical force and derogatory language is clearly wrong. So the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
