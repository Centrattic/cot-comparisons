Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a 5-year boyfriend who made a stew for himself and gave the leftovers to the author, who's been struggling with cooking and finances. The author asked for a portion when he was cooking, but he refused. Later, he told her to clean the dishes after eating his leftovers, which she found unreasonable. She snapped at him, and he called her ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were justified. She's in a financial situation that limits her ability to cook proper meals. Her boyfriend, who's not in financial trouble, made stew for himself but only gave her leftovers. Then he expected her to clean up, which he had just done. The key points here are the expectation of mutual respect and the imbalance in their dynamic.\n\nThe boyfriend cooking for himself and giving leftovers isn't a generous act, especially if it's just because he's full. The author's frustration comes from feeling treated like a servant or a dog, not being considered a partner. When she asked to be included in the meal, he refused, which might have made her feel undervalued. His reaction\u2014pushing her and calling her names\u2014is clearly wrong and abusive. \n\nThe author's response was to express her anger, pointing out the lack of kindness. It's a reaction to his controlling behavior. She's not the one who's in the wrong here because he's being unreasonable and disrespectful. The situation seems to involve emotional and possibly physical abuse, which is a serious issue. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. Her boyfriend's actions are the problem, and her response was justified given the circumstances.\n"
