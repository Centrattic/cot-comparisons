Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of being treated like a dog. The situation involves financial struggles, cooking, and an argument over dishes.\n\nFirst, the author is dealing with medical expenses and can't afford meat often. They asked the boyfriend to cook for them when he made stew, but he said no. Later, he gave them leftovers, which were barely enough. Then he made the author clean the dishes, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in a relationship and fairness in responsibilities. The author is in a difficult financial situation, which the boyfriend is aware of since he's not struggling. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave leftovers, which the author had to eat because they couldn't make a proper meal. Then, the boyfriend expected the author to clean up, which the author had already done earlier. The boyfriend's response\u2014pushing the author and calling them names\u2014shows a lack of empathy and respect.\n\nThe author's outburst was in response to being physically restrained and treated unfairly. They expressed frustration about not being treated kindly, which is valid given the circumstances. The boyfriend's actions (not sharing the meal, giving leftovers, then demanding cleanup) set up the dynamic the author is criticizing.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should contribute and respect each other's needs. The boyfriend's behavior here seems entitled and dismissive, especially considering the author's financial hardship. The author's reaction is a stand against being taken advantage of, which isn't unreasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend's actions were the issue.\n"
