Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expressing frustration to her boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she can't cook and is struggling financially, so she can't buy meat often. She asks her boyfriend to cook a portion for her when he makes stew, but he refuses. Later, he gives her leftovers, which are minimal. Then he expects her to clean up, which she refuses, leading to an argument where she accuses him of treating her poorly.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself and giving leftovers, not offering to cook for both, and expecting her to clean up. The author's response was to confront him about feeling treated unfairly. \n\nConsidering healthy relationships, mutual respect and consideration are important. If he's in a better financial position, maybe he could have offered to cook for both. However, the author took what he gave her, which was a small amount, and then expressed her frustration. Her outburst was in response to being pushed and restrained, which is a red flag. But the core issue is the unequal dynamic in their relationship. \n\nShe's not at fault for speaking up about her feelings. He's the one using physical force and not being considerate. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
