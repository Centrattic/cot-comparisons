Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author can't afford meat and has limited groceries. Her boyfriend cooks a meat stew for himself but refuses to make a portion for her, even though he has enough ingredients. Later, he gives her leftovers, which are barely enough. Then he makes her clean up, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and fairness. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, had the means to cook for both but didn't. He gave her leftovers, which she felt was inadequate. Then he expected her to clean up, which she had already done, leading to physical confrontation.\n\nThe author's response was to express her frustration, which seems justified given the context. She's in a difficult financial situation, and he's not contributing fairly. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her an ungrateful bitch and threatening not to cook for her again\u2014shows disrespect. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consideration are crucial. The boyfriend's actions (not cooking for her despite having the means, giving minimal leftovers, and then being angry about cleaning) suggest a lack of support. The author standing up for herself in that moment, pointing out the unfair treatment, isn't wrong. She's asserting her needs and boundaries, especially when he's not meeting them. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior, including physical restraint and yelling, is problematic. The author isn't wrong for expressing her feelings, especially after being treated poorly. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
