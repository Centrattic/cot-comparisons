Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's struggling financially due to medical expenses, can only afford basic groceries, and hates cooking. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks for a portion, but he refuses, even though there's enough ingredients. Later, he offers her leftovers, which are barely enough. Then he demands she clean the dishes, leading to a confrontation where she snaps and calls him out on not cooking for her properly. He responds by calling her names and threatening not to cook for her again.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics here. The author is in a vulnerable position financially and physically. She's not cooking, not because she doesn't want to, but because she's unable to afford ingredients and finds cooking difficult. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has the means to buy meat more regularly. His actions of cooking for himself but not her, then giving her leftovers, might be seen as not considering her needs. When she refuses to do the dishes immediately, he uses physical force, which is a red flag. The fact that he pushed and restrained her is a serious issue, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author's outburst is a reaction to being treated unkindly and disrespectfully. She points out that his actions aren't kind, as he didn't cook for both of them, only gave her leftovers. Her frustration is understandable given her circumstances. However, the key point here is the boyfriend's behavior: using physical force, not being considerate of her financial situation, and not cooking enough for her. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to ongoing mistreatment and a lack of mutual consideration.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions\u2014physical aggression and not being supportive during her hardships\u2014are definitely wrong. The author's frustration leading to her outburst is a result of this mistreatment. So, she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, especially when he's acted abusively. The situation seems more about his behavior than hers.\n"
