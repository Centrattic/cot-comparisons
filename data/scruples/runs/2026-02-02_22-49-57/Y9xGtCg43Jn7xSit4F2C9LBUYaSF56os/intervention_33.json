Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author can't cook well, is struggling financially, and can only afford basic groceries. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks for a portion, but he says no. Later, he offers the leftovers, which are minimal. Then he demands she clean up, even though he was the one who cooked. She snaps, he pushes her, and they argue.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and respect in the relationship. The author is in a difficult financial situation, which affects her ability to prepare meals. Her boyfriend, who has resources, cooks for himself but denies her a proper meal. Then he expects her to clean up, which she isn't responsible for. The physical pushing is a red flag for abuse, regardless of who started the argument.\n\nThe author's reaction is a response to being mistreated. She's frustrated with his lack of generosity and the physical aggression. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014denying her food, then demanding she clean up, and using physical force\u2014seems controlling and disrespectful. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, partners support each other. The boyfriend's actions don't reflect support; they're more about him asserting control. The author is standing up for herself, which is valid when facing mistreatment. So, she's not in the wrong for expressing her frustration and setting boundaries.\n"
