Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. The situation involves financial struggles, unequal sharing of cooking responsibilities, and an argument over leftovers and dishwashing.\n\nFirst, the author is dealing with medical expenses and limited funds, only able to afford basic groceries. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a stew but refuses to make a portion for her. Later, he gives her leftovers but expects her to clean up. She snaps, leading to an argument where he threatens to never cook for her again.\n\nThe key points here are the power dynamics and expectations in the relationship. The boyfriend expected her to cook, but she can't due to financial constraints and lack of cooking skills. He cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which she felt was unkind. When she expressed frustration, he responded with anger and threats.\n\nThe author's reaction was justified given the context. She's in a position where she can't contribute financially to meals and is doing her best under difficult circumstances. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to share his meal, expecting her to clean up, and calling her names\u2014shows a lack of support and empathy. The author standing up for herself, especially after being pushed and restrained, is a reasonable response to abuse of power in the relationship.\n\nNo one is in the right when it comes to being treated disrespectfully. The boyfriend's actions are more harmful, so the author isn't in the wrong for confronting him. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
