Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. The situation involves financial hardship, unequal cooking responsibilities, and a confrontation over leftovers and dish duty.\n\nFirst, the author is struggling financially and can't afford to cook meat often. She asked her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, to make a portion for her when he was cooking stew. He refused, then gave her leftovers, which were barely enough. Later, he made her clean the dishes even though he was the one who cooked. She snapped, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and respect in the relationship. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, then expected her to clean up. The author felt disrespected, especially since she's in a tough financial spot. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014anger, pushing her, calling her names\u2014is abusive behavior regardless of the situation. \n\nThe author's outburst was about standing up for herself after feeling used. She's been in the relationship for five years and expects better treatment than a roommate or servant. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share the meal, then demanding help without offering to cook for both\u2014show a lack of support and consideration. \n\nFinancial struggles shouldn't justify poor behavior. The boyfriend's response was inappropriate, and the author was within her rights to express her frustration. She's not being unreasonable for wanting mutual respect and support in the relationship. The boyfriend's actions are more concerning here, as they involve physical restraint and verbal abuse. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
