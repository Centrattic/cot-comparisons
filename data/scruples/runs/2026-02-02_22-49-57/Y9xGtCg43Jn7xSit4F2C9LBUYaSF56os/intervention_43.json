Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict between a girlfriend and her boyfriend over cooking and cleaning. The author is a woman who's struggling financially, can't cook well, and is poor, so she relies on her boyfriend's cooking. The boyfriend cooked a stew for himself, gave her leftovers, and then made her clean up. She snapped at him, and he called her names. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a difficult financial situation, which limits her ability to cook. She's not a good cook and can't afford to buy more than basics. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks for himself and gives her leftovers, which are minimal. Then he expects her to clean up, leading to a confrontation where she expresses her frustration and he reacts angrily.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the boyfriend's actions weren't kind. She points out that he cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, and then expected her to clean up. She felt treated like a dog, not a partner. She snapped because she's tired of this treatment.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and healthy relationships, mutual respect and fairness are important. The boyfriend's actions seem to be taking advantage of her situation. He has the means to cook for both, but he didn't. Instead, he gave her minimal leftovers and then expected her to do the dishes, which she didn't cook. That's not fair. The author is standing up for herself after being treated unfairly. Her outburst is a reaction to his behavior, not the root cause.\n\nThe boyfriend's response\u2014calling her an ungrateful b*tch\u2014shows disrespect and an unwillingness to acknowledge her perspective. In a healthy relationship, both partners should consider each other's needs and circumstances. The author's financial struggles and inability to cook are valid factors here. The boyfriend's failure to address these by cooking for both, and instead giving her leftovers, indicates a lack of consideration.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her frustration. The boyfriend's actions and reaction are problematic. The argument is about unequal expectations and lack of mutual support. The author's response is a justified stand-up for her dignity. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
