Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself and gave the leftovers to his girlfriend, who was hungry. She then told him she was tired of being treated like a dog, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is in a financial situation where she can't afford much, and her boyfriend isn't. He cooked for himself, had leftovers, and gave her a small portion. She felt it wasn't enough and maybe not generous. Then, when she tried to clean up, he pushed her and got angry, which led her to snap back.\n\nThe question is about who's at fault. From the description, the boyfriend's actions seem questionable. He cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, and then expected her to clean up without making her dinner. The girlfriend's response was to stand up for herself after being physically restrained. \n\nThe user might want to know if her reaction was justified. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing and restraining\u2014crosses into abuse, which is a serious issue. The girlfriend's outburst was a reaction to that abuse. So, the boyfriend's actions are clearly wrong, and the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially after being mistreated. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's expectation that she should cook for herself might be unrealistic, given her financial situation. He has resources to cook a meal but didn't share it, then expects her to do the dishes. The girlfriend's frustration is valid. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and she was asserting herself after being mistreated.\n"
