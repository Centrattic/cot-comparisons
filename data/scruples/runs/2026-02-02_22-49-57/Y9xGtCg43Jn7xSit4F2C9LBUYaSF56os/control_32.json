Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So I need to analyze the situation based on the information given.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions that she can't cook well, hates cooking, and is currently financially strained due to medical expenses. She can only afford basic groceries and meat every two weeks. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooked a stew for himself. She asked if she could have a portion, but he said no. Later, he gave her leftovers (only two spoonfuls), and then expected her to clean up. When she refused, he pushed and restrained her, leading her to snap and confront him.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and respect in the relationship. The boyfriend's actions seem to be controlling and disrespectful. He's in a position where he can afford to buy groceries, and yet he's not sharing the meal he cooked, which is something the author can't do herself due to her financial situation. His refusal and then giving her minimal leftovers, followed by physical aggression over dish duty, is a red flag.\n\nThe author's reaction is in response to being treated poorly. She's not wrong for defending herself, especially after being physically abused. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic: expecting her to cook when she can't, not considering her financial situation, and using physical force. The author's statement about not being his dog or roommate highlights her frustration with the unequal treatment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her frustration. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. He should have considered her circumstances, shared the meal, and not resorted to physical aggression. The author's outburst is a reaction to being mistreated, so she's justified in standing up for herself. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
