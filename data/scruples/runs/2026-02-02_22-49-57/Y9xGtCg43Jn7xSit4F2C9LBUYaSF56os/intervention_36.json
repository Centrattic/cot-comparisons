Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in her situation with her boyfriend. The key points here are about fairness in a relationship, especially regarding chores and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's in a financial hardship, can't afford meat often, and her boyfriend cooked for himself. She asked to share his meal but was refused. Then he gave her leftovers after eating most of it. She felt he wasn't being kind because he didn't cook a full meal for her. She ended up doing the dishes later, and when he pushed her to clean immediately, she snapped. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, giving leftovers, expecting her to clean up right away, and responding angrily when she refused. The author's reaction was frustration over being treated unfairly. She points out she's not his dog or roommate, implying an unequal dynamic.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should share responsibilities. The boyfriend's behavior seems controlling and disrespectful, especially with the physical pushing and the angry outburst. The author standing up for herself in that moment, despite her financial situation, shows she's asserting her dignity. \n\nFinancial struggles shouldn't make one person a servant. The boyfriend's refusal to cook a full meal and his expectation of immediate cleanup without considering her situation is problematic. The author's outburst was a reaction to cumulative stress and mistreatment. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her boyfriend's actions are the issue here. She's defending her rights in the relationship. Answer B.\n"
