Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions she's a terrible cook, hates cooking, and is struggling financially. She can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta because of medical expenses. Meat is expensive, so she can only have it once every two weeks.\n\nThe incident happened when she was studying. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, made a meat stew. She asked if she could have a portion since he was making it. He said no, even though there were enough ingredients for two. Later, he ate his stew and offered her the leftovers, which were just two spoonfuls. She ate that because she hadn't eaten properly all day. Then, when she tried to put her dish in the sink, he cornered her and made her clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She got angry, told him off, and he called her an ungrateful bitch.\n\nSo, the question is, is she in the wrong? Let's look at the key points here.\n\n1. **Financial Situation and Needs**: The author is in a tough spot financially. She can't afford to cook for herself, especially meat-based meals. Her boyfriend isn't in financial trouble. When she asked to have a portion of his stew, he refused. That seems unkind, especially since he had the resources to make a meal that she couldn't afford.\n\n2. **Leftovers as a Meal**: He gave her leftovers, but they were barely enough. She had to eat it because she hadn't eaten all day. The boyfriend's action here might be seen as a minimal gesture, but it's not a proper meal. She was left with no choice but to accept it, but that's not generous.\n\n3. **Expectation of Gratitude**: After she ate the leftovers, he expected her to clean the dishes. He physically pushed her and restrained her when she refused. That's a clear case of abusive behavior. He shouldn't have used physical force to make her do chores. The fact that he was the one who cooked and then made her clean up is not fair. If he cooked, he should have done the dishes himself, especially since she's in a vulnerable position financially.\n\n4. **Communication and Control**: The boyfriend's reaction to her snapping back is problematic. He called her names and threatened to not cook for her again. The author's frustration is valid because she's in a difficult situation and he's not supporting her. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, he resorted to aggression and control.\n\n5. **Power Dynamics**: The boyfriend's actions suggest a lack of respect and empathy. He's using his financial stability to exert control over her. The author's anger stems from feeling treated unfairly and unappreciated. Her outburst was a reaction to his abuse and lack of support.\n\n6. **Physical Abuse**: The boyfriend physically pushed and restrained her. That's a serious red flag. Any form of physical violence in a relationship is unacceptable and makes the boyfriend entirely at fault.\n\nPutting this all together, the boyfriend's behavior is abusive and inconsiderate. The author is not in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially after being physically harmed. She's in a vulnerable position and deserves support, not control. The boyfriend's refusal to accommodate her needs, the use of physical force, and the verbal abuse all point to him being at fault. The author's frustration and anger are justified given the circumstances.\n"
