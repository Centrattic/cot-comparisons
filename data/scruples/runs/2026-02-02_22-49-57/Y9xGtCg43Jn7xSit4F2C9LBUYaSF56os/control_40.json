Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they're asking for help in determining whether they did something wrong by confronting their boyfriend about his behavior.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend. She's struggling financially, can't afford meat often, and isn't a good cook. Her boyfriend cooks a stew for himself, gives her a tiny portion of leftovers, and then gets angry when she doesn't clean up. She ends up yelling at him because she feels treated poorly, calling him out for not being generous and acting like she's a dog. He responds by calling her names and threatening not to cook for her again.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect, fairness in the relationship, and how each person is handling the situation. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Financial Hardship**: The author is dealing with medical expenses and can't afford groceries beyond basics. This is a legitimate challenge. Her boyfriend is not in financial trouble, which might affect how responsibilities are divided.\n\n2. **Cooking Incident**: He cooks for himself and gives her leftovers. She had asked if he could make a portion for her when he started cooking. He said no, which left her with little to eat. She ends up eating a small part of his leftovers. This seems like a lack of consideration from his side, especially since she's in a vulnerable position.\n\n3. **Cleaning Up**: After eating, he makes her clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She argues that it's his responsibility, but he pushes her and gets angry. Physical restraint is a red flag\u2014any form of physical aggression is a serious issue.\n\n4. **Communication and Respect**: The author snaps because she feels disrespected. She points out that his act wasn't kind, just a minimal gesture. His response is to call her names and threaten to stop cooking for her. This shows a lack of empathy and respect on his part.\n\n5. **Power Dynamics**: The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing her, restraining, yelling\u2014indicates a power imbalance. The author standing up for herself is a reaction to being mistreated for a long time.\n\nNow, considering all this, the author is defending herself against what she perceives as unfair treatment. Her financial situation is a valid factor, and her boyfriend's actions (not providing a proper meal, physical aggression) are problematic. The author's frustration leading to her outburst is a reaction to ongoing issues, not just this single incident.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions are clearly in the wrong with the physical aggression and lack of support. The author had to confront him about being treated poorly, which is justified. However, her response of yelling and confronting him might not be the healthiest way to handle it, but given the circumstances, it's understandable as a defense mechanism.\n\nThe core issue here is the boyfriend's behavior\u2014being ungenerous, using force, and disrespecting her. The author is not in the wrong for expressing her anger and standing up for herself in a relationship where she's been treated badly. The physical restraint is a severe issue that makes the boyfriend's actions unacceptable.\n"
