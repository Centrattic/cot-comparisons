Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend cooking a stew for himself and not offering to share, then expecting her to clean up after him. The author snaps, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author is struggling financially due to medical expenses, can only afford basic groceries, and doesn't cook well. Her boyfriend isn't in financial trouble. He cooks a meaty stew for himself, gives her leftovers, and then demands she cleans the dishes. The author feels treated poorly, comparing herself to a dog or roommate, not a partner.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The boyfriend cooked for himself, not them both. When asked to share, he refused. Later, he gives her leftovers but expects her to clean up. The author's frustration is justified given her circumstances. She's in a relationship of five years, so there's an expectation of mutual support. Cooking a meal for oneself isn't inherently wrong, but refusing to share when he has the means and the author is struggling financially could be seen as selfish. Additionally, the physical altercation (pushing and restraining) is a red flag. The boyfriend's actions in the moment are aggressive, which might indicate a pattern of controlling behavior.\n\nThe author's response was to express her frustration and set a boundary. She didn't cook, but he didn't offer to cook for her either. His reaction of yelling and calling her names is abusive. The key points here are the financial disparity, the boyfriend's refusal to share despite being able to afford meat, the physical aggression, and the author's justified anger at being treated unfairly.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are crucial. The author's actions were a reaction to being mistreated. She's in a vulnerable position financially, and her boyfriend isn't contributing equally in terms of cooking or support. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into emotional and possibly physical abuse with the pushing and aggressive language. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and expressing her feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
