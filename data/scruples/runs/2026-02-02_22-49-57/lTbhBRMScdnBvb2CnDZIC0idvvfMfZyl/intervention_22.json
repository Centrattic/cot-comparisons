We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's been doing it a lot and they were planning to move in together, but she changed her mind citing her Christian community's disapproval. The author is frustrated with her double standards since they're already having sex before marriage and she's against moving in together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which is significant. The author thinks moving in together makes sense given their closeness and the fact that they work together. However, the girlfriend now wants to wait until marriage. The author is pointing out the inconsistency because if sleeping over is frowned upon, then the frequent visits and the sexual activity before marriage might be at odds with her beliefs. \n\nBut wait, in some Christian communities, premarital sex is considered wrong, but cohabitation might also be discouraged. However, the girlfriend is already choosing to sleep over multiple nights, which could imply that she's not against the practice as much as she's against the idea of moving in together. The author is highlighting that inconsistency. \n\nIs the author wrong to call her out on this? The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, and the author is using her own criteria to argue against the current arrangement. If the author told her she couldn't sleep over, that might be a way to enforce her standards, but it could also be seen as using her beliefs against her. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend has the right to her beliefs, but the author is entitled to their feelings about the double standard. However, the author's proposed action (stopping her from sleeping over) might be a form of manipulation or a power play. It's important to consider the intent. If the author is trying to enforce the girlfriend's standards without mutual discussion, that's problematic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is frustrated and wants to address the inconsistency. But instead of abruptly stopping the sleepovers, a better approach would be to discuss and understand each other's perspectives. The question is whether the author is justified in using the girlfriend's stated values to limit their own behavior. \n\nIn relationships, it's about compromise and respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is okay with sleeping over but not moving in, the author might find that restrictive. However, the author's response to stop her from sleeping over could be seen as invalidating her previous choices and imposing their own standards. \n\nSo, the author's action might be inconsiderate. They should focus on having an open conversation rather than using the girlfriend's beliefs as a weapon. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting her current decision and treating her standards as a tool against her rather than a mutual understanding.\n"
