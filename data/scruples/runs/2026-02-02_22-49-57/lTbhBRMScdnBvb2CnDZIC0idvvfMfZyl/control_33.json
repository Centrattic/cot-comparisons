We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been dating a few years, and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The author thinks they should move in together, but she refuses unless they get married, citing her Christian community's views on cohabitation before marriage. The author finds her stance judgmental, especially since she's already sleeping over and they have sex. He's considering cutting off her sleepovers using her own logic.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is acting appropriately. The key points here are the girlfriend's stance on premarital cohabitation and the author's response. The girlfriend is holding a double standard in the author's view because she's against moving in together but is okay with sleeping over and having sex. The author is considering retaliating by enforcing a similar rule, which is cutting off sleepovers, based on her own criteria. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, respecting each other's boundaries is important. However, there's a conflict here where the girlfriend's actions (sleeping over, having sex) contradict her stated beliefs. The author is frustrated and wants to address the inconsistency. But is it fair for him to impose a new rule based on her own reasoning? \n\nLegally and socially, cohabitation and premarital sex are personal choices, and the morality of such actions is subjective. The author's approach could be seen as using her own argument against her, which might be a form of manipulation or emotional leverage. While the girlfriend may hold inconsistent views, the author's response could be seen as taking her beliefs to an extreme. \n\nAdditionally, communication is a key factor. The scenario mentions they've been talking about it. The author's decision to cut off sleepovers without a prior agreement might be abrupt and hurtful. It could escalate tensions and lead to further conflict. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of addressing it might be misguided. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether enforcing a rule based on the girlfriend's own moral standards is justified. While the author has valid concerns about double standards, retaliating in this way could be seen as unfair, especially since the girlfriend's actions are already inconsistent with her beliefs. The author's approach might lack empathy and understanding, focusing on punishment rather than resolving the underlying issues through dialogue. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's using her moral arguments against her in a way that could be seen as manipulative and doesn't address the root of the problem through mutual understanding.\n"
