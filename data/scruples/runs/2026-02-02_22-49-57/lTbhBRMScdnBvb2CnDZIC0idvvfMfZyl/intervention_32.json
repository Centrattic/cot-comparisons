We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which is a lot. They work together and live close. The author is suggesting moving in together, but she refuses, citing religious reasons (Christian community) that moving in before marriage is improper. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy because she's already staying over frequently and having sex, which he sees as inconsistent with her values.\n\nThe author is considering using her own standards to justify cutting off the sleepovers. The question is whether he's in the wrong by doing that. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, using someone else's standards against them can be seen as manipulative or hypocritical. However, the author is pointing out inconsistencies in her stance. The key here is whether the author's action is fair given her own behavior. If he's using her religious beliefs to make a point, but she's violating those same beliefs, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's using her standards as an excuse to end something she's already agreed to, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, communication is a big part of relationships. If the author hasn't discussed this with her before deciding to cut off sleepovers, that could be an issue. The question is whether his action is justified based on her stated beliefs. Since she's the one who set the rule, but is not following it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he's being passive-aggressive or using guilt, that's different.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend might have her own reasons for not moving in, even if she's sleeping over. She might value spending time together but has personal or cultural reservations. The author is frustrated and wants to address the inconsistency. However, cutting off sleepovers abruptly might not address the underlying issues. They need to talk about their future plans and whether they can compromise.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is pointing out hypocrisy, which is fair. But acting on it by enforcing her own standard might be seen as taking it too far. However, if the author is trying to resolve the inconsistency by holding her to the same standards, that's not necessarily wrong. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for using her own standards against her.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency in her standards. However, the way he enforces it matters. If he's using her logic to make a point, it's not inherently wrong, but it's important to have an open discussion. The key is that he's responding to her own criteria, so he's not wrong for using that logic. But the action of cutting off sleepovers might be more about communication than right or wrong.\n"
