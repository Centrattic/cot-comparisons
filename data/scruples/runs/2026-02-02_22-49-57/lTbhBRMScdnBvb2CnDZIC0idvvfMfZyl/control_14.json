      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy in the scenario) is in the wrong if he tells his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating for a few years. She sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The guy thinks moving in together makes sense, but she doesn't want to because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy\" and \"improper.\" The guy is frustrated by her double standards since they are already having sex and she's sleeping over often. He's considering cutting off her sleepovers using her own criteria.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consistency and double standards. The girl says sleeping over 4+ nights a week is okay because she likes spending time with him, but moving in together is not. However, moving in together and sleeping over 4+ nights a week are similar in terms of physical intimacy and cohabitation. The guy is pointing out the inconsistency here. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author uses her own reasoning (that pre-marital cohabitation is improper) to stop her from sleeping over, is that fair?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, applying her standards to himself might seem logical if he's arguing for consistency. But relationships require mutual respect and understanding. However, if he's using her own words against her to change her behavior, is that justified? It's a bit of a tricky situation. \n\nOn one hand, the guy is pointing out her double standard, which is a valid critique. On the other hand, using her standards to limit her actions could be seen as manipulative. But since she's the one who set those standards, maybe it's fair. But moving in together versus sleeping over 4 nights a week might be considered different levels of cohabitation. \n\nWait, moving in together is more than just sleeping over; it's sharing a household. But sleeping over multiple nights a week is also a form of cohabitation. So if she considers moving in together improper, then sleeping over 4+ nights a week might be seen as the same by others, but she's making a distinction. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she's already engaging in behavior she deems improper (sleeping over, sex before marriage), then he can use her own logic to stop her from sleeping over. But the problem is that the author is not applying the same standard to his own actions. He's using her standards against her, which could be seen as hypocritical if he's not following them himself. \n\nAlternatively, if she's the one who brought up the moral standards, then the author is pointing out the inconsistency. So maybe the author isn't wrong in highlighting that inconsistency. However, the action of cutting off sleepovers based on her own standards could be seen as a power move rather than a genuine attempt to resolve the double standard.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is being hypocritical by not following his own stance (i.e., he's not against pre-marital intimacy because he's engaging in it), then he might be in the wrong. However, the author is not necessarily advocating against pre-marital intimacy; he's using her own standards to challenge her actions.\n\nThis is a bit of a paradox. If the author is applying her standards to her actions, he's being consistent. But if he's using her standards to manipulate the situation, then that's where it gets tricky. The key here is the concept of double standards and whether it's fair to apply her own rules to her in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is pointing out a double standard, which is a valid critique. However, using her standards to cut off sleepovers might be seen as using her own rules against her, which could be a strategic move rather than a moral one. The author's action is a response to her inconsistency, but whether it's right or wrong depends on the relationship dynamics and mutual respect. Since the author isn't violating any rules but is instead highlighting inconsistency, maybe he's not in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. The answer might be B (No), as he's not wrong to address the double standard by applying her own logic.\n"
