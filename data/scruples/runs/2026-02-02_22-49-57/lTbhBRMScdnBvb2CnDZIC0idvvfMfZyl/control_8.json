I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they're both working at the same company. They were considering moving in together, but the girlfriend decided against it because of religious reasons, saying it's \"trashy and improper\" in her Christian community. The author is upset because she's already staying over a lot and having sex before marriage, which he sees as a double standard. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers based on her own standards.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is improper, but she's already sleeping over frequently. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here. By her own logic, if cohabitation is wrong, then sleeping over regularly should also be considered wrong. The author is considering using her standards against her to stop the sleepovers. \n\nIs that fair? Well, the author is using her own reasoning to make a point. But does that make him in the wrong? If he's applying her standards to her own actions, maybe he's highlighting hypocrisy, but is it right for him to enforce that? Also, the girlfriend's reasons are rooted in her religion, which she might genuinely hold. The author is frustrated with the double standard, but perhaps he should have addressed this earlier or discussed their boundaries more openly. \n\nBut cutting off communication or changing the rules suddenly could be seen as a manipulation tactic. The author is using her own standards to justify his action, which might backfire. It could lead to conflict rather than resolution. The girlfriend might feel that he's exploiting her beliefs to control the situation. Also, the fact that they have been sleeping together before marriage complicates things. If her standards include avoiding premarital sex, then both actions (sleepovers and cohabitation) are against her values. However, maybe she's not as strict about the sleepovers as the moving in part. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. If he's using her beliefs to end the sleepovers, he's essentially holding her accountable to a standard she set, but perhaps inconsistently. It's possible that the girlfriend didn't realize the inconsistency herself, and the author is pointing it out. But by taking the step to cut off sleepovers, is he overstepping? It might be better to have an open conversation about their values and expectations rather than an ultimatum. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but using her standards against her might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of enforcing a sudden change, maybe discussing why there's a discrepancy between her actions and beliefs would be more constructive. The author could be in the wrong if he's using her beliefs to manipulate the situation rather than addressing the underlying issues through communication. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's using her own standards in a way that could be seen as manipulative rather than seeking mutual understanding.\n"
