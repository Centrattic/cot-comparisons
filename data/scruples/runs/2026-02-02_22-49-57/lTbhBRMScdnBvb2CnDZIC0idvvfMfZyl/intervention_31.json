      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They live close and work together. He thinks moving in together makes sense, but she refuses until marriage because of her Christian beliefs, calling cohabitation \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds this hypocritical given their current sleeping arrangement and sexual activity. He's considering using her own argument against her to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nSo, the key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The girlfriend objects to cohabitation before marriage for religious reasons but engages in it herself. The author feels this is inconsistent. The question is whether enforcing her standards would be wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's main issue is hypocrisy. If her beliefs are that cohabitation is improper, then his actions (sleeping over) might be beyond the bounds she's set. However, the problem is that she's already violating her own standards by sleeping over multiple nights a week. So, using her own reasoning to stop her from doing so could be seen as holding her accountable, but it's also using her standards against her, which might be manipulative.\n\nBut wait, the author is in a position where he's considering cutting off the sleepovers, which are something she's been doing. If he uses her own argument (\"since it's trashy according to you, you can't do this anymore\"), he's pointing out her inconsistency. However, the author is in a position where he can enforce limits based on her beliefs. If he's uncomfortable with the double standards, he might be justified in setting boundaries, but if he's the one enforcing her beliefs, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, which she has a right to uphold. However, she's not living up to her own standards. The author might be right to call out her inconsistency, but enforcing her beliefs on her could be seen as using her own values against her, which might not be fair. Alternatively, if he's following his own moral compass and is tired of the hypocrisy, he's acting in self-preservation.\n\nBut is it the author's place to judge her? He's not in the wrong for stating his perspective, but if he's applying her standards to end the sleepovers, he's creating a situation where she might feel targeted. The core issue is mutual respect and communication. The author could be in the right by addressing the hypocrisy and setting boundaries, but using her own words against her might come off as a power move rather than a constructive discussion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is justified in feeling frustrated with the double standards, and it's his prerogative to adjust the relationship dynamics based on that. However, the method of using her beliefs against her could be seen as retaliatory. The answer hinges on whether enforcing her standards is fair or if it's a form of manipulation.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address the inconsistency, but the approach might be. The key is whether the action is about mutual respect and communication versus using her beliefs as a weapon. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on the context of their communication and intentions. If the author is being honest about his feelings and setting boundaries due to her hypocrisy, it's more about self-respect. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
