We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating for years, she stays over 4+ nights a week, and they work at the same company. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until marriage because it's \"trashy\" and improper in their Christian community. But she's been sleeping over a lot, which the author points out as a double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's stance is against cohabitation before marriage but she's already staying over frequently. The author is frustrated with her double standards and considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards. \n\nThe main issue here is hypocrisy. She's against cohabitation but engages in it by sleeping over. The author is using her reasoning against her. Is that fair? Well, if she's applying her standards consistently, then she shouldn't be sleeping over. But she's doing it, which suggests she's not sticking to her own beliefs. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is valid. \n\nBut the author wants to retaliate by enforcing her standards. The question is whether that's wrong. If the author sets boundaries based on her own stated values, that's reasonable. However, relationships require mutual respect. The author might be using her standards to justify his actions, but should he enforce her beliefs on her? That could be seen as hypocritical as well. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. The girlfriend's actions contradict her beliefs. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. However, cutting off sleepovers abruptly might not be the best approach. Communication is key. Instead of just enforcing her standards, discussing the issue and setting mutual boundaries would be healthier. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's using her own standards to enforce a change, it's a bit of a logical move, but the method might be harsh. However, the problem lies in the girlfriend's inconsistency. The author isn't wrong to address it, but the approach could be better. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is responding to her hypocrisy. But maybe there's nuance. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Using her own rules against her isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
