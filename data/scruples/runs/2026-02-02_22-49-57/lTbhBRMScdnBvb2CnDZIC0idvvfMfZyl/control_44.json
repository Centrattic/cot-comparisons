She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. They've been dating a few years, she's there 4+ nights a week, they work together, and live close. The key issue is the girlfriend's stance on moving in together before marriage, calling it \"trashy and improper,\" but she's already sleeping over a lot and they're having sex. The author is frustrated with the double standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's reasoning is based on her Christian community's values, but she's already engaging in behaviors that others might see as conflicting with those values. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. He wants to apply the same standard to stop her from staying over, which would create a stalemate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if someone's values are leading them to actions that seem contradictory, others might challenge that. But using her own standards against her could be seen as hypocritical. The author is trying to enforce the same judgment she applies to cohabitation on their current situation. However, the girlfriend's argument is about moving in together, not just sleeping over. So the author is conflating the two. \n\nThe moral question here is about hypocrisy. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage but engages in other premarital activities, the author is pointing out the inconsistency. But forcing her to stop sleeping over because of her own values might not be fair if those values don't explicitly cover that scenario. The author's actions could be seen as taking her words out of context. \n\nAlso, relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author is upset about the double standard, he should address it with her rather than impose a unilateral decision. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering that action. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the author uses her own standards to cut off her presence, he's holding her to a standard she agreed to. However, her standards were about moving in, not about sleeping over. So he's applying her rule to a different situation. Therefore, he might be misapplying her values. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author is fairly applying her values. If he's using her stance on moving in to justify another action (sleeping over), he might not be in the wrong in his own perspective, but in reality, he's misinterpreting her position. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for misapplying her standards. But if the girlfriend's reasoning is hypocritical, the author's response is pointing out the inconsistency. However, the act of using her own words against her to end something else (sleeping over) is perhaps not the right approach. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's misapplying her values to a different context. Alternatively, if the author is frustrated with the hypocrisy, maybe B. But since the girlfriend's stance is about moving in together and not about sleeping over, the author is conflating two different issues. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's using her reasoning against her in a way that's not directly related. So answer A.\n"
