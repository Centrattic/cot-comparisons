We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for potentially telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which the author sees as a step towards moving in together. The girlfriend refuses to move in because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author is frustrated because she's sleeping over a lot and has sex without marriage, yet she objects to moving in. The author is considering using her own standards to cut off sleepovers, which seems hypocritical.\n\nThe key points here are hypocrisy and mutual respect. The girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, but her actions (sleeping over and having sex) might contradict those beliefs. The author is pointing out this inconsistency. However, the author is also using her standards to justify cutting her off, which could be seen as using her own rules against her. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the situation involves differing values. If the girlfriend is unwilling to move in but continues to sleep over and have sex, that's a conflict. The author is trying to hold her to her own standards. However, cutting off sleepovers suddenly without discussion might not address the underlying issues. The problem might be more about communication and aligning expectations rather than just applying her rules reciprocally. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out hypocrisy, but enforcing her own standards on her might not be fair either. The core issue is whether both parties can agree on boundaries that respect each other's beliefs. If the author uses her standards to make her stop sleeping over, but she's already doing things that align with those standards, it's a bit of a paradox. So, the author's approach might not resolve the issue and could be seen as using her own rules against her, which isn't fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not addressing the root of the problem and instead applying her own logic in a way that could be seen as manipulative.\n"
