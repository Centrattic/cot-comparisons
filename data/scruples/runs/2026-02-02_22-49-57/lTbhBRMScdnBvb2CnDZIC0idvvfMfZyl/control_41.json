She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their differing views on moving in together and sleeping over due to religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for years and she sleeps over four or more nights a week. They work together and live close. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but the girlfriend refuses, citing Christian values that consider it improper before marriage. The author finds this hypocritical because they already sleep together and she's staying over a lot. He's considering cutting off her sleepovers using her own logic as a reason.\n\nSo, the key points here are hypocrisy and the potential consequences of the author's action. The girlfriend is maintaining a double standard by sleeping over and having sex but refusing to move in together. The author is upset and wants to enforce her rules, which could lead to a breakup or conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's responding to her stated values. But by using her own reasoning against her, he might be acting out of anger or frustration. However, he's also being consistent in applying her standards, which she's the one who set. On the flip side, maybe he's overreacting by cutting off sleepovers instead of discussing the issue. The right approach might be communication rather than punishment. But according to the rules she set, if she considers cohabitation before marriage as trashy, then the author is just applying her logic. However, the hypocrisy here is on her side because she's already in a situation that could be seen as similar (frequent sleepovers and sex). \n\nThe author's action could be seen as justified if he's pointing out her inconsistency. But by enforcing a sudden stop to sleepovers, he's creating a problem. Maybe he should talk about the inconsistency first. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's using her own moral reasoning against her, it's a bit of a trap. But maybe he's not wrong because he's standing up for his perspective. Alternatively, he's being unfair if he's using her rules to punish her without discussion. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B). He's holding her to her own standards, even if it's a bit of a ploy. The real issue is the hypocrisy in her stance, not his response to it. So B for No.\n"
