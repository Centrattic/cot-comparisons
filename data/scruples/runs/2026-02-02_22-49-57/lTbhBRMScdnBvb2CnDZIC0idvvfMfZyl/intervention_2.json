We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for considering to tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their girlfriend sleeping over four or more nights a week, which the author sees as leading to them moving in together. The girlfriend, however, doesn't want to move in together until marriage due to her Christian values, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds this hypocritical given their current living arrangement and wants to enforce the same standards, hence the dilemma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend is sleeping over frequently but refuses to move in together until marriage, citing religious beliefs. The author is frustrated by what they perceive as a double standard. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for responding with the same reasoning\u2014telling her she can't sleep over if that's considered improper according to her beliefs.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want a second opinion. So, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend has expressed her stance, so the author is trying to hold her to that standard. However, changing the rules on her might not be fair if she's not been clear about her expectations. But the author is also pointing out inconsistency: if sleeping over is improper until marriage, then why does she do it four nights a week? The author is using her own logic against her, which could be seen as fair.\n\nEthically, hypocrisy can be an issue. The girlfriend's actions contradict her stated beliefs. The author is highlighting that contradiction by applying the same standard. In that sense, the author's response might be justified as a way to encourage consistency. However, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the girlfriend's stance is rooted in her values, the author needs to consider that while also asserting their own needs.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationship. If the author enforces the rule, it could lead to conflict or resentment. The girlfriend might feel the author is being judgmental or not respecting her beliefs. But the author is also not in the wrong for not wanting to be in a situation they find hypocritical. It's a balancing act between respecting each other's values and maintaining personal boundaries.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no wrong in setting boundaries. The author is within their rights to decide who stays at their place. However, the ethical aspect is more nuanced. The key is whether the author is acting in good faith. Since the author is pointing out the inconsistency rather than being vindictive, it's more about seeking fairness.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to apply the same standards the girlfriend uses. The girlfriend's actions don't align with her stated beliefs, and the author is addressing that discrepancy. While the approach might be confrontational, the intention is to resolve inconsistency, which is a valid relationship concern. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
