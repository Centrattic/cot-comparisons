We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their living arrangements and differing views on cohabitation based on their Christian community's standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over frequently, which the author sees as a step toward moving in together. The girlfriend, however, insists on waiting until marriage due to her beliefs, but continues to sleep over. The author is frustrated by what they perceive as hypocrisy, given her current behavior versus her stated values.\n\nThe key here is understanding both perspectives. The girlfriend's stance is rooted in her religious beliefs, which she's communicated. She's made a choice not to cohabit, even though her current sleeping arrangements blur that line. The author is pointing out the inconsistency and wants to enforce a boundary based on her own standards. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for holding her to that standard? Well, the author is reacting to a double standard. If the girlfriend's beliefs are important, the author has a right to address inconsistencies. However, the author's threat to stop allowing sleepovers might be seen as using her own standards against her, which could be manipulative. \n\nBut the author's main point is that the girlfriend is applying her standards while not adhering to them. The author is frustrated and wants to set a boundary. Whether that's wrong depends on communication and mutual respect. If the author approaches this as a discussion rather than a punishment, it's more about addressing the inconsistency. However, making a unilateral decision to cut off sleepovers could be seen as taking her own standards too far, especially if the girlfriend isn't in agreement. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's boundaries and communicate openly. The author might be justified in pointing out the hypocrisy, but enforcing a sudden change without discussion could strain the relationship. The answer hinges on whether the action is about enforcing mutual respect or using the girlfriend's standards against her. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing frustration, but the approach could be problematic. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for considering the action. Since the author is highlighting a double standard and setting a boundary based on the girlfriend's own criteria, it's a bit of a gray area. But leaning towards not being in the wrong because they're responding to a perceived inconsistency in good faith.\n"
