We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their girlfriend from sleeping over after she refuses to move in together despite their frequent cohabitation. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a few years, she's over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. They were considering moving in but she changed her mind, citing Christian values against cohabitation before marriage. The author is frustrated because she's already staying over a lot and having sex, so they see her stance as a double standard. He's considering cutting off sleepovers using her own standards.\n\nThe key points here are about hypocrisy and boundaries. The girlfriend is maintaining certain moral standards but her actions (sleeping over, having sex) don't align with them. The author is reacting to that inconsistency.\n\nIs the author in the wrong if he enforces his own standards based on her criteria? Well, maybe. If he uses her reasoning against her, it could be seen as hypocritical. But he's pointing out her inconsistency. However, cutting off sleepovers suddenly might be harsh. The question is whether he's entitled to use her standards to make a decision that affects her autonomy. \n\nAlso, communication is key. Have they discussed this? The author mentions they've been talking about moving in, so it's in the open. The author's frustration is valid because the girlfriend isn't being consistent. But enforcing a rule based on her own values might not be fair either. \n\nBut the author isn't holding her to her standards; he's using her own reasoning to change his behavior. He's not imposing his beliefs but pointing out the contradiction. However, cutting off sleepovers without considering her reasons might be abrupt. Still, he's within his rights to set boundaries if he's uncomfortable with her double standards. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's using her standards to enforce a change, maybe not. But if he's doing it out of frustration without considering her perspective, maybe. The answer hinges on mutual respect and communication. Since they were discussing moving in together, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. But given the situation, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
