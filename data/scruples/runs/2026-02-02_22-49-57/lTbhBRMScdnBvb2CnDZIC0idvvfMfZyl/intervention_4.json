We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend doesn't want to move in together before marriage, citing it's trashy and improper due to their Christian community's views. However, she sleeps over multiple nights a week, which the author points out as a double standard. The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own reasoning against her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together is frowned upon, but she's already staying over frequently. The author is frustrated with this inconsistency. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if he enforces a similar standard by limiting her sleepovers.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author mentions they've been talking about it, so maybe there's been discussion. The girlfriend's argument is about following community norms, but her actions don't align with those beliefs. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy. But would it be wrong for the author to enforce a rule based on her own stated beliefs?\n\nIf the author were to stop her from sleeping over because she says it's improper, that could be seen as holding her to the same standards she applies to him. However, maybe the author is overstepping by using her own rules against her. Or perhaps he's justified in pointing out the inconsistency. The key is whether the author's actions are hypocritical or if he's logically applying her reasoning.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's behavior (sleeping over) is more intimate and could be seen as equally or more improper in the same community. If she's against cohabitation but engages in it, the author is highlighting her inconsistency. But enforcing a rule based on her beliefs might not be fair if he's not willing to compromise on other aspects. The author might be trying to set boundaries based on her own stated values, which could be seen as a fair approach.\n\nBut if the author is using her own words against her to limit her presence, is that fair? It might be a way to encourage consistency, but it could also be manipulative. The author's frustration is valid, but enforcing a sudden restriction without mutual agreement could hurt the relationship. The core issue is the double standard. The author is trying to resolve this by adjusting his behavior, but the problem might be deeper about differing values and expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's addressing a double standard. However, using her beliefs against her might not be the best approach. The answer hinges on whether applying her own criteria is justified. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the author's actions might not be wrong, as he's responding to her inconsistency. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
