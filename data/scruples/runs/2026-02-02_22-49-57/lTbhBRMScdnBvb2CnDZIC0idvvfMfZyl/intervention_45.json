She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The context is that they've been dating for years, she's over 4+ nights a week, and they were considering moving in together. But she changed her mind, citing it's trashy and improper in their Christian community, even though they're not in a rush to marry. The author is frustrated with what they perceive as double standards, especially since they've already been having sex before marriage. Now, they're thinking of cutting off sleepovers based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break down the key points. The girlfriend is in a Christian community that frowns upon cohabitation before marriage. However, she's been sleeping over frequently, implying a level of intimacy. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here. If she's against moving in together but still sleeps over often, there's a contradiction. The author wants to enforce her standards by stopping the sleepovers, which seems like a logical follow-up if they're to be taken seriously.\n\nBut is it fair for the author to impose that? The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her beliefs, yet her actions don't align. The author might feel that if her beliefs are important, she should stick to them. However, the author is also in a relationship where there's already a level of physical intimacy. The author could be using her standards as a way to address their own discomfort with the double standard, but by enforcing it, they might be projecting their own judgment onto her.\n\nAnother angle: the author and girlfriend might have different expectations. The author might be ready to move in, while she isn't. The author is considering cutting off sleepovers to avoid hypocrisy, but is that the right approach? Maybe they should discuss the inconsistency in her behavior and see if they can agree on boundaries. If the author unilaterally stops sleepovers, it could be seen as abrupt and possibly disrespectful, unless there's been prior discussion about aligning their actions with her beliefs.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"trashy and improper\" seems like a subjective judgment. The author could be reacting to her being judgmental. However, the question is about whether the author is wrong for using her own standards to set boundaries. The author has the right to set boundaries based on the partner's values, especially if those values are important to both. But if the girlfriend isn't ready to move in together, maybe the author should respect that and instead have an open conversation about how they can both honor their beliefs, perhaps by adjusting their current arrangements without suddenly cutting things off.\n\nIt's important to consider communication. The author might feel wronged if the girlfriend's standards are not applied consistently, but changing the relationship dynamic suddenly without discussion could hurt her. The right approach might be to talk about the inconsistency rather than just ending sleepovers. If the author is frustrated with double standards, they should express that and seek mutual understanding. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating first and instead making a unilateral decision based on perceived hypocrisy.\n"
