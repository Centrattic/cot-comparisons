We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they work at the same company, live close, and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They're not rushing into marriage, but he thinks moving in together makes sense. She refuses to move in together until marriage, citing her Christian community's views as \"trashy and improper.\" He's pointing out the hypocrisy because they already have a lot of physical intimacy, and he's tired of her double standards. He's considering using her own reasoning to cut off sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key issues are double standards, communication, and mutual respect. He's using her stated values against her, which could come off as manipulative. Even if she's being inconsistent, confronting her by cutting off sleepovers might be seen as a power play rather than a constructive discussion. Healthy relationships require open dialogue where both parties feel heard. By unilaterally deciding to stop sleepovers, the author might be imposing his will without addressing the underlying issues. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's stance on moving in together versus their current behavior (sleeping over and having sex) does seem hypocritical. However, the author's response could be seen as taking a principle he disagrees with and applying it in a way that serves his own needs. Instead of using her logic to enforce his own actions, a better approach would be to discuss the inconsistencies and seek a compromise. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is pointing out valid concerns about hypocrisy, but his method of addressing it might be flawed. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's responding to her double standards by applying the same logic, but in a way that could be seen as retaliatory, he might be. The right approach would be to address the hypocrisy through communication rather than using her argument to cut things off. So, the answer is likely A, yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
