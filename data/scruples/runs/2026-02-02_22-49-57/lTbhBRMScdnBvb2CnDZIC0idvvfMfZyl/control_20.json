We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who's been dating a few years. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week at his place. They work together and live close. The author wants to move in together, but she refuses because she's in a Christian community that frowns on cohabitation before marriage. However, she still sleeps over often and has a lot of sex pre-marriage. The author is frustrated by the double standard and wants to tell her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own standards as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The couple has been discussing moving in together, so there's some prior communication. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, but she's choosing to sleep over and engage in sexual activity, which seems contradictory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which might be valid, but cutting off sleepovers abruptly could be seen as harsh.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's beliefs are her own, but she's not holding herself to the same standard. The author is using her own criteria against her, which could be seen as a way to challenge her double standards. However, the author's decision to stop sleepovers entirely might be seen as a punishment or a lack of understanding, even if there's a valid point. Relationships require compromise, and maybe the author should have addressed the double standards through discussion rather than an ultimatum. On the other hand, the author has a right to express their feelings and set boundaries if they feel disrespected.\n\nConsidering that both parties have different values and the situation is causing conflict, the author might not be in the wrong if they're standing up for their own standards. However, the method of enforcing the change (telling her she can't sleep over anymore) could be problematic. It's important to approach such situations with empathy and open dialogue. Since the girlfriend has been sleeping over despite her beliefs, maybe the author's response is a reaction to being manipulated or inconsistent. But without more context on their communication, it's hard to say. The answer might be B (No), because the author is pointing out a double standard, but the approach could be better handled. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the author is being judgmental or not addressing it constructively. Hmm.\n"
