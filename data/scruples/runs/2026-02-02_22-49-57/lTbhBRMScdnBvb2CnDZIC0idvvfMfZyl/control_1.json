I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person posting the question) is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because he's upset about her double standards. \n\nSo, the situation is that they've been dating for a few years and she's over at his place 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but the girlfriend says she doesn't want to move in until they're married because of her Christian values\u2014saying it's trashy and improper. But he points out that she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage, which he sees as a double standard. Now he's considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own criteria against her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about double standards, mutual respect, and boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend is against cohabitation but is okay with sleeping over and having sex. The author is frustrated by this inconsistency and wants to enforce her own standards, which he feels are hypocritical. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author is considering using her standards against her, which might be seen as a form of manipulation or holding her to a standard he doesn't agree with. Even if her stance is hypocritical, is it fair for him to suddenly enforce those same standards on her? That could create resentment or make her feel criticized. \n\nAlso, the concept of being \"in the wrong\" here might hinge on intentions and respect. If the author is trying to control the relationship by applying her values without mutual agreement, that could be problematic. Relationships require compromise, and if one person's values are conflicting with the other's actions, it's a matter of aligning their expectations. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's own actions (sleeping over and having sex) do seem to contradict her stated beliefs. The author is pointing out this inconsistency, which is valid. But taking it a step further by cutting off sleepovers as a punishment based on her own criteria might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to conflict instead of constructive dialogue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention is to address the double standard. But using her standards to limit her actions might not be the most respectful way. The right approach would be to discuss their differing values and reach a mutual understanding. If he unilaterally decides to enforce her values, that's where he might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using her standards to cut off the relationship without mutual agreement could be seen as unfair. However, if the girlfriend's standards are indeed inconsistent, the author has a point, but the method of addressing it might be the issue here. The key is whether the approach is respectful and part of a dialogue or a unilateral decision. Since the author is considering cutting off sleepovers based on her own criteria without mutual agreement, that's where the potential wrongdoing lies.\n"
