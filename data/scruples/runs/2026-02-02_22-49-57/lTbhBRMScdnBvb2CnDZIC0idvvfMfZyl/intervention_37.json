We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together before marriage, even though they already sleep over frequently. The girlfriend says moving in together is \"trashy and improper\" due to her Christian community's views, but the author finds her stance judgmental, especially considering their current relationship status.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. Both are in a committed relationship for several years, work together, and live close. They sleep over 4+ nights a week, which implies a close physical relationship. She's against cohabitation before marriage, but they already have a level of cohabitation (sleeping together). The author is upset about her double standards and wants to enforce her own rules by cutting off sleepovers, which would create a problem.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are mutual respect, communication, and consistency. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, but she's already engaging in behaviors (sleeping over, having sex) that some might consider inconsistent with her beliefs. The author is pointing out the inconsistency and is frustrated. However, using her own reasoning against her by cutting off sleepovers might not be fair, especially if they both are already in a sexual relationship before marriage. \n\nBut wait, the author is using her logic (that pre-marital cohabitation is improper) to justify ending their current arrangement. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation, but the author and she are already cohabiting (sleeping together), then the author is highlighting the hypocrisy. However, the author is taking action based on that hypocrisy, which might be a bit of a trap. The key is whether the author is applying the same standards they criticize. \n\nAnother angle: the author is responding to a double standard by enforcing the same standard, but maybe the girlfriend's position is more about moving in together versus sleeping over. The author might be conflating the two. Also, the author is in a position where they're using her own rules to limit her actions, which could be seen as manipulative. But they are both adults and the relationship is consensual. \n\nThe main issue is mutual respect. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, but retaliating by cutting off sleepovers might not be the healthiest approach. However, if the author believes that their actions (sleeping over) are against her beliefs, then they have a right to set boundaries. But maybe the author is overreacting by using her own rules against her, especially if the girlfriend is aware of the implications. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because they are pointing out the inconsistency and setting boundaries based on the girlfriend's own criteria. However, the approach might not be the best for the relationship's health. But in terms of right or wrong, the answer would be B, No.\n"
