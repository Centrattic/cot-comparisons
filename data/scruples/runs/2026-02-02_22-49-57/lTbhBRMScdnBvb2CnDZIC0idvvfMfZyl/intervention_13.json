We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the relationship scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who's been dating for years, and the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. The author, the boyfriend, is considering setting boundaries because the girlfriend doesn't want to move in together before marriage, citing her Christian community's views as \"trashy and improper.\" The author is frustrated with her double standards since they're already sleeping together a lot but don't want to live together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is the conflict between their values and the boyfriend's response to her stance. The girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage but engages in other behaviors (sleepovers, sex) that might be seen similarly in some Christian contexts. The boyfriend is pointing out the inconsistency and considering using her own arguments against her to stop the sleepovers.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend is trying to address the inconsistency he perceives. However, using her own values against her to restrict her presence might not be the healthiest approach. It could come off as manipulative or confrontational. Instead of just imposing a rule, a better approach might be discussing the discrepancies in their values openly and finding a compromise that respects both their beliefs without using guilt or hypocrisy as a weapon.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's frustration is valid if he feels she's being judgmental. But responding by cutting off sleepovers because of her standards might escalate the conflict rather than resolve it. It's important to consider the intent behind the girlfriend's stance\u2014perhaps she values marriage more and wants to maintain boundaries as per her faith. The boyfriend's approach might undermine her reasons or feel like a power play.\n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for having this frustration, the method of addressing it\u2014by using her standards to restrict her\u2014might not be the right approach. The key is whether the author is respecting her boundaries while also expressing his own needs. If he's using her own arguments to hurt or manipulate, that's problematic. But if he's honestly trying to address the inconsistency, maybe in a constructive way, that's different. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong if he tells her she can't sleep over anymore using her criteria. That could be seen as hypocritical or unfair, hence maybe he is in the wrong by not handling it with more empathy and dialogue rather than a sudden ultimatum.\n"
