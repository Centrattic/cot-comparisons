We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating for a few years, she's staying over multiple nights a week, and they work together. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until marriage because of her Christian community's views, but she's already sleeping over a lot. The author is upset about her double standards and wants to enforce a rule against her staying over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is making a judgment based on her religious beliefs about moving in together before marriage, but she's already engaging in other behaviors (sleeping over, sex) that might be considered similar. The author sees this as a double standard and wants to hold her to the same standards she applies to them. \n\nIs the author wrong to point out the inconsistency? Well, the author is responding to the girlfriend's own stated beliefs. If the girlfriend is using her religious standards to judge the author, then the author might be within their rights to apply those same standards to her. However, the situation is complicated because relationships often involve mutual agreements and compromises. The author's decision to stop allowing sleepovers could be seen as retaliating or using her own beliefs against her, which might not be fair.\n\nBut the author also has a right to express their feelings about the double standards. The key here is whether stopping the sleepovers is an appropriate response. The author is using the same criteria the girlfriend applied to them, so there's a consistency there. However, relationships require communication and negotiation. If the author is doing this as a way to make a point or force a compromise, it might be a valid approach, but if it's just to be punitive, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's stance is causing the author discomfort. The author is tired of the double standards and wants to set a boundary. By enforcing the same standards, the author is trying to address the inconsistency. In that case, the author might not be wrong. On the other hand, if the author is being hypocritical in their own actions (like if they're not adhering to the same standards), but the question doesn't mention that. The author is pointing out the double standard in the girlfriend's behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing a double standard that the girlfriend herself has set. However, the method of stopping sleepovers could impact the relationship negatively. But based on the information given, the author is trying to enforce consistency based on the girlfriend's own beliefs, which makes sense. So the answer is probably B.\n"
