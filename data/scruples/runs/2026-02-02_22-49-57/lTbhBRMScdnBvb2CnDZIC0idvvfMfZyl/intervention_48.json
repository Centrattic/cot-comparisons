      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for potentially telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. He thinks moving in together makes sense, but she doesn't want to until marriage because of her Christian community's views. The conflict arises when he argues that her standards are double standards since they're already having sex and she's sleeping over a lot. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers based on her own \"trashy\" reasoning.\n\nNow, the key points. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is improper. But she's already staying over frequently, which the author points out as a contradiction. He's frustrated by what he sees as hypocrisy. The question is whether his response\u2014telling her she can't sleep over\u2014is justified, especially by applying her own standards.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, communication is key. The author has been talking about moving in together, and she's made her position clear. However, he's now considering using her standards against her. The core issue is about double standards and mutual respect. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's religious community values premarital chastity, but she's choosing to sleep over, which might imply she's not strictly adhering to those values. The author might see her actions as inconsistent with her beliefs, hence his frustration. On the other hand, the author is now using her standards to make a point, which could be seen as a bit of a trap\u2014applying her rules in a way that might not be fair.\n\nBut if the author is doing this to make a point about consistency, perhaps it's a valid strategy. However, cutting off sleepovers entirely could be harsh. Relationships require negotiation and compromise. If the author is using her reasoning to enforce a change in their current situation, he might be holding her to a standard she's not willing to uphold, which could be seen as unfair. The girlfriend might not have considered the implications of her own standards when she agreed to sleep over so often. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is a valid argument, but the enforcement might be abrupt.\n\nAnother angle: The author's frustration is real. If she's using religious standards to avoid moving in together but is okay with frequent sleepovers and sex, it's a valid point for him to bring up. However, telling her she can't sleep over might not be the best approach. Instead, a conversation about mutual values and expectations might be better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for doing it.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships have gray areas. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but using her own standards to cut off sleepovers could be seen as a bit of a power play. However, since the girlfriend is the one who set the standard (improper before marriage), the author is applying her logic to her actions. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the real issue is that the girlfriend is contradicting herself, and the author is holding her accountable. If the author is applying her standards to her actions, he's not wrong. However, relationships require mutual respect, and if he's using her standards in a way she didn't anticipate, that could cause issues. But given the situation, using her own reasoning to adjust their current arrangement might be justified. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
