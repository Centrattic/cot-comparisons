We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after deciding to stop their girlfriend from sleeping over because she's against moving in together before marriage, even though she's been doing so for years.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but she insists they wait until marriage due to her Christian community's views. The author is frustrated with her double standards since they're already having sex and living together informally. He's considering cutting off sleepovers using her own \"improper\" standard.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend is making a choice based on her values, but she's also engaging in behavior that contradicts those values. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. In a relationship, both parties should respect each other's boundaries. If she's against cohabitation but is effectively doing it now, that's a conflict. The author's response is a form of holding her accountable for her standards. However, using her own criteria to stop her from sleeping over might be a bit of a passive-aggressive tactic. But given the inconsistency in her stance, it's not entirely unreasonable. The key is whether the author is respecting her boundaries while also addressing the contradiction. It seems like the author is trying to resolve the inconsistency, so maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
