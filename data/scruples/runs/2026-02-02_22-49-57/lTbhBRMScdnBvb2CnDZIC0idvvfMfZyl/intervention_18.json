We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their living arrangements, cultural beliefs, and mutual expectations.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating for years and she sleeps over frequently. They work together and live close, so moving in was a natural step. But she doesn't want to move in yet because of her Christian values, which she says frown upon cohabitation before marriage. However, they are already having sex, which is a contradiction in her stance. The author is pointing out the double standard here and considering cutting off the sleepovers based on her own criteria.\n\nNow, the key points are her religious beliefs conflicting with her actions. She's applying a standard (not moving in) that she's not following fully (since they're already having sex). The author is frustrated with this inconsistency. The question is whether he's in the wrong for using her own values against her to stop the sleepovers.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is highlighting hypocrisy. If her beliefs consider cohabitation immoral before marriage, but she's engaging in sexual activity, which is also traditionally considered wrong before marriage (depending on religious views), then there's a contradiction. The author is using her own reasoning to set boundaries, which could be seen as fair because he's pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect. The author might need to communicate this without being punitive. Instead of abruptly cutting off sleepovers, discussing the inconsistency and finding a compromise might be better. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for considering this action, not the method. Since he's using her own values to address her double standards, it's a valid response. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
