We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (the author) is in a relationship with their girlfriend, and she's been sleeping over multiple nights a week. They work together and live close, so moving in together makes sense. The girlfriend, though, doesn't want to move in together until they get married because she's in a Christian community that frowns upon cohabitation. But she's already sleeping over a lot, which includes having sex before marriage.\n\nThe author is frustrated with her double standards. They're considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own reasoning about it being \"trashy and improper.\" The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know what the answer is.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend is opposed to moving in together before marriage, citing religious or cultural values. However, she's already engaging in behavior (sleeping over and having sex) that's against those same values. The author is pointing out the inconsistency and wants to hold her to her own standards.\n\nIs the author wrong to call out the double standard? Well, the author is not forcing her to sleep over; they're making a mutual decision. But if the author decides to stop allowing her to sleep over based on her own values, that's enforcing her standards on her. But does that make the author wrong? It might be a way to highlight the inconsistency. However, the author's motivation is frustration with the girlfriend's stance. The author might be using her own criteria against her, which could be seen as a fair response to the double standard. Alternatively, it might be seen as using her values against her in a tricky way.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be in a position of power here because they're the one who owns the place where she's staying. So by saying she can't sleep over, it's a way to enforce their own boundaries. But the girlfriend is also making a choice to sleep over, so maybe the author is within their rights to set that boundary. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nThe main issue is the double standard. The girlfriend adheres to certain values but ignores them when convenient. The author is pointing that out. If the author is following their own values (maybe being direct, honesty) by not tolerating the double standard, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the author is being hypocritical, like if they have their own double standards, then maybe they are in the wrong. But from the given info, the author is just reacting to the girlfriend's inconsistency. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're calling out the inconsistency in the girlfriend's stance. The author is using the girlfriend's own values against her to highlight the contradiction, which isn't necessarily wrong. It's more about enforcing mutual respect and honesty in the relationship.\n"
