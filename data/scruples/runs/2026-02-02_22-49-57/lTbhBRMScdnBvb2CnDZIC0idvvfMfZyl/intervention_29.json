We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she said it's \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community unless they're married. The author is frustrated with her double standards since they've been sleeping together a lot already.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend has expressed her views, but maybe there's a deeper reason she's hesitant to move in together. The author is considering using her own standards against her, which might be a form of manipulation. It's important to respect each other's values, even if they differ. The author has the right to set boundaries, but the approach matters. Instead of cutting off sleepovers abruptly, discussing the concerns and finding a compromise might be better. The girlfriend's stance might be rooted in her beliefs, but the author is also valid in feeling that the double standard is inconsistent. However, using her own words to deny sleepovers could come off as punitive. The core issue is mutual respect and understanding. So, while the author isn't entirely wrong, the method of enforcing the change might be. The answer leans towards B (No), but with the caveat that communication and mutual respect are crucial.\n"
