She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to stop their girlfriend from sleeping over because of her double standards regarding moving in together before marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for a few years, she stays over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The author thinks moving in together is logical, but the girlfriend refuses until marriage, citing her Christian community's views. The author is upset because she sleeps over a lot and they're already having sex, which the author sees as a double standard. The author wants to call her out by stopping her from sleeping over, using her own standards.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend has her reasons based on her beliefs, but she's not acting on them consistently. The author is pointing out inconsistency. However, using that inconsistency as a reason to punish her by cutting off sleepovers seems harsh. The author's action could be seen as taking her beliefs literally in a way that might not be fair, especially since the girlfriend hasn't enforced her own standards regarding other aspects (like sex before marriage? Wait, the user mentions they've been having a lot of sex. Wait, does that contradict her beliefs? The question is whether she thinks sex before marriage is acceptable, but she's against cohabitation. So maybe she's okay with sex but not cohabitation, which the author is pointing out as a double standard.\n\nBut the author is using her own stated beliefs against her to justify cutting off sleepovers. That could be seen as a form of hypocrisy, but is it the author's fault? The author is reacting to the girlfriend's inconsistency. However, the author's approach might be seen as manipulative or taking advantage of her own values. Alternatively, maybe the author is justified in pointing out the inconsistency. But is it wrong to use that as a reason to end the sleepovers?\n\nAlso, moving in together is a big step, and she's choosing not to do it for religious reasons. The author might feel that the girlfriend isn't being honest or consistent. But the author's solution is to retaliate by enforcing her own standards, which the author is not necessarily committed to. The author might be in the wrong because they're using her beliefs against her in a way that could be hurtful. Alternatively, the author is just calling out the inconsistency, which might be fair, but the action of cutting off sleepovers is a punishment, which might be unfair.\n\nI think the key here is whether using the girlfriend's own values against her in this way is appropriate. The author is pointing out her double standard, which is valid, but the action of cutting off sleepovers is a form of punishment that might not be justified. The author could have addressed the inconsistency without cutting off sleepovers. Also, the girlfriend's reasons for not moving in together are personal and based on her beliefs, even if they seem inconsistent. The author's response might be seen as taking her beliefs out of context or using them as a weapon. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using the girlfriend's own standards to enforce a decision that might not be fair, especially if the sleepovers aren't inherently against her values unless she's moving in. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
