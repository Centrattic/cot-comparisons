We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who have been dating for years and the girlfriend is staying over multiple nights a week. The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together until marriage, citing her Christian community's views as being \"trashy and improper.\" The author thinks this is judgmental, especially since she's already sleeping over a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, which she uses to justify not moving in together. But she's already staying over frequently, which the author points out might contradict her values. The author is frustrated by what they see as a double standard and is considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own arguments.\n\nThe key points here are about consistency and respect. The author is using her reasoning against her, which might be valid if her actions don't align with her beliefs. However, relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the author suddenly stops allowing sleepovers without discussing it, that could be seen as a manipulation of her own values against her. But the author is also pointing out hypocrisy, which isn't without merit.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of boundaries. The author is setting a boundary based on the girlfriend's stated criteria. However, relationships should be about dialogue, not ultimatums unless both parties agree. The author might be reacting out of frustration, but enforcing such a rule could create more conflict than resolution.\n\nIt's also important to consider the cultural and religious context. In some Christian communities, cohabitation before marriage is discouraged, but sleeping over might be a gray area depending on the specific beliefs. The girlfriend's frequent visits might already be a point of contention within her community, but she's choosing to prioritize spending time with the author over strict adherence.\n\nThe author's main issue is the perceived double standard. The girlfriend's reasoning against moving in together contradicts her current behavior. The author is using her own reasoning to challenge her, which could be a valid approach if handled with respect. However, abruptly cutting off sleepovers might be harsh and could hurt the relationship without a prior discussion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong in pointing out hypocrisy, but the method of addressing it could be problematic. The right approach would involve open communication and understanding each other's perspectives. The author's suggestion to use the same criteria against her might not be the healthiest way to resolve the issue, as it could come off as manipulative.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but the approach needs to be considered more carefully. However, the user is asking for a strict A or B. Given the situation, the author is not in the wrong because they're responding to a double standard, but the execution is important. However, since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and the author is pointing out inconsistency, which is valid, the answer is B.\n"
