We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they're in a Christian community, and the girlfriend is against moving in together before marriage because it's \"trashy and improper.\" However, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. The author is frustrated with her double standards because they're having sex and living separately, which he sees as being in the same situation as moving in together.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. The girlfriend has her own standards based on her beliefs, but her actions (sleeping over, frequent cohabitation without moving in) might contradict her stated values. The author is pointing out inconsistency, which is a valid point. If her religion frowns upon premarital cohabitation and premarital sex, then both sleeping over and having sex without being married would be against those standards. So, the author is highlighting a contradiction in her stance.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using her own standards against her. If he's applying her criteria consistently, he's not being hypocritical. He's pointing out that if her beliefs are about propriety, then the current arrangement is equally improper. But is it fair for him to impose his interpretation of her beliefs onto her actions? The author is using her own standards to justify a change in their relationship dynamics. \n\nHowever, the key here is mutual respect. The author's action is a consequence of her own beliefs. If she's not willing to move in together, but continues to sleep over, perhaps the author is trying to hold her accountable. But is it his place to enforce her beliefs? Or is he just reacting to her double standards? It's possible he's right in pointing out the inconsistency, but taking action (telling her she can't sleep over) might be the issue. \n\nBut wait, he's not enforcing her beliefs; he's using her standards to argue that her current behavior is improper. If she's against cohabitation before marriage, then sleeping over multiple nights a week effectively is cohabitation. So, if he's making her choose between her beliefs and her actions, that's a valid argument. Therefore, he's not wrong in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the action of telling her she can't sleep over anymore could be seen as a harsh reaction. But given the context, it's a response to her own standards. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong because he's addressing a double standard. The girlfriend's inconsistency is the root issue here. The author is using her own criteria to challenge her behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
