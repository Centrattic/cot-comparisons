      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the couple has been dating for a few years, and the girlfriend sleeps over at his place 4+ nights a week. They work at the same company and live close. The author thinks it's time to move in together, but the girlfriend says she doesn't want to move in until they're married because she thinks it's trashy, improper, and frowned upon, especially in their Christian community. The author is frustrated because she's already sleeping over a lot and having sex, but she's against cohabitation. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore using her own standards.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is applying her own standards to her actions. If she says it's trashy to live together before marriage, but she's already sleeping over a lot, which could be seen as similarly close. The author is using her reasoning against her. But is that fair? Maybe she's more okay with occasional sleeping over than living together. The line between sleeping over a few nights a week and moving in together isn't the same, but the author is pointing out inconsistency. \n\nHowever, the author's response might be hypocritical if he's not following the same standards. But he's pointing out that her actions (sleeping over and having sex) are similar to moving in together but she's okay with that. So he's highlighting a double standard. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a personal relationship issue. The author could be trying to resolve this by setting boundaries based on her own criteria. But maybe he's being too harsh by cutting off sleepovers entirely. The girlfriend might see sleepovers as less serious than cohabitation. \n\nAlso, communication is key here. The author mentions they've talked about it. If he's going to enforce a rule, it's important to discuss it with her. But is it wrong to do so? The author is standing up for his own standards if he feels she's being inconsistent. Alternatively, he could be using her own beliefs against her in a way that's unfair. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's addressing the inconsistency in her stance. If she's against cohabitation but is okay with frequent sleepovers and sex, he's pointing out the contradiction. However, the way he enforces it could be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the method. So B (No) might be the answer.\n"
