We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend sleeps over at his place several nights a week. They work at the same company and live close. The author thinks it's logical to move in together since she's there so often. The girlfriend, however, doesn't want to move in until they're married because she considers it \"trashy and improper\" due to her Christian community's views. The author finds her stance judgmental, especially since they already have a lot of physical intimacy. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own standards against her.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong if he enforces that rule. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are mutual expectations and consistency. The girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage, citing religious reasons. However, she's already sleeping over multiple nights a week, which is physically living together in a way, even if not officially moving in. The author sees this as a double standard because they're already engaging in behaviors that the community might frown upon (sleeping together, having sex), yet she's against moving in together. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, consistency matters. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage, but is already engaging in overnight stays, the author might feel she's not being consistent. But using her own standards to set boundaries could be a valid approach. However, the author's response of cutting off sleeping over is a bit of a logical step, but maybe a harsh one. \n\nThe core issue is about values and boundaries. The author is trying to hold her to her stated beliefs, but enforcing that might lead to conflict. The question is whether it's fair to apply her own criteria in this way. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's trying to address the inconsistency he perceives. However, the way he enforces it might be problematic. Instead of an ultimatum, perhaps communication and compromise would be better. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering the situation, the author is not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. However, the action of cutting her off immediately might be seen as punitive, but given the stated reasons, it's a response to her own standards. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
