We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she previously claimed that moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week at his place. They work together and live close. She doesn't want to move in together before marriage, but continues to sleep over. The author finds her stance judgmental, especially since she's already sleeping over frequently and they have sex. He's considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong to do that. The key points here are about consistency and hypocrisy. The girlfriend argues against moving in together based on her community's values, but her actions (sleeping over many nights) might contradict that. The author is pointing out the double standard by using her reasoning against her. \n\nIs the author wrong for calling out the inconsistency? On one hand, he's using her criteria to enforce a change in behavior. On the other, he's acknowledging her standards but applying them to her actions. However, the situation is about mutual respect and communication. The author might be retaliating instead of discussing the issue. The girlfriend's reasons for not moving in are personal and community-based, but if she's already sleeping over, maybe she's okay with some level of cohabitation. The author could be misapplying her standards by extending them from moving in together to individual sleepovers. \n\nAlso, the author's action could be seen as punitive, using her own standards to cut off something she's already doing. While he's pointing out inconsistency, he might be overreacting. Relationships require compromise and communication. The right approach would be discussing the issue rather than making a unilateral decision based on the other's standards. So, the author's action might be wrong because it's a form of using the other's reasoning against her in a way that wasn't previously considered (sleepovers vs. moving in together). Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
