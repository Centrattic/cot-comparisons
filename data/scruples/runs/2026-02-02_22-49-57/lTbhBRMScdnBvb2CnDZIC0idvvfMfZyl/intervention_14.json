I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they work at the same place. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but she doesn't want to because of Christian beliefs that it's \"trashy and improper\" until marriage. The author is frustrated with her double standards since they're already having sex and she's staying over a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend has stated her reasons based on her religious beliefs. She sees cohabitation as improper, but she's okay with sleeping over and having sex. The author feels this is a double standard and wants to enforce her own standards by cutting off sleepovers. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. They've been talking about this, so the author might feel justified in pushing back. However, using her own standards against her in a way that's punitive could be seen as manipulative or hypocritical. The author is essentially saying, \"You said this is wrong, so I'll stop allowing it,\" which might not be fair because the girlfriend is choosing to cohabit despite her beliefs. The author's action could be a way to force her to confront her own values, but it's also a power move.\n\nEthically, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's standing up for himself and trying to address inconsistencies. However, the approach of cutting off sleepovers might not be the healthiest way to resolve the issue. Maybe a better solution would be to have a deeper conversation about their future and whether their values align. The author could also consider if he's okay with their current arrangement or if he wants to move forward differently. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Socially, it's complicated. If he's acting on his own beliefs and trying to set boundaries, that's his right. However, using her own standards to punish her might not be the best strategy. It could lead to resentment. The key here is mutual respect. The author might not be in the wrong, but his method could be seen as using her beliefs against her, which could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's stance is based on her religion, which values premarital abstinence. However, she's choosing to cohabit without marriage, which her religion might frown upon. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. If the author decides to enforce her beliefs by limiting sleepovers, it's a bit of a paradox because he's applying her rules to their relationship. But since they're in a committed relationship, the author might feel that her rules are impractical and unfair. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are a reaction to perceived hypocrisy. Whether he's in the wrong depends on how he enforces it. If he's being fair and they're discussing it openly, maybe not. But cutting off sleepovers as a punishment could be seen as taking advantage of her own stated beliefs. So perhaps the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's responding to her double standards, but the approach might not be ideal. Alternatively, A (Yes) if enforcing her beliefs in that way is not appropriate. \n\nI think the key here is the author is trying to address a double standard. He's not necessarily in the wrong, but the method might not be the best. Since the question is about \"in the wrong,\" and considering that he's acting within his right to set boundaries, the answer is B.\n"
