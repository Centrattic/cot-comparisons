We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The context is that the couple has been dating for years, she's been staying over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The main issue is the girlfriend's stance on moving in together before marriage due to religious beliefs, but she's already staying over a lot, which the author sees as a double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of both sides. The girlfriend follows her Christian values by not wanting to move in together before marriage, which she deems improper. However, she's already staying over multiple nights a week, which is similar to living together. The author points out the inconsistency here. The author's response is to retaliate by applying her own standards to limit her visits, which could be seen as hypocritical or using her own rules against her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using someone's moral standards against them can be a form of manipulation. The author is essentially saying if your beliefs are about morality, then I'll enforce them on you, even if you're already not following them. That might not be fair. The author is pointing out the double standard, but the method of response\u2014cutting off sleepovers\u2014could be harmful. The girlfriend might feel the author is being judgmental, which isn't constructive. Instead of addressing the issue through dialogue, the author is taking a punitive action based on the girlfriend's own values. That might not be the right approach. So, while the author's frustration is understandable, the action taken could be seen as wrong because it's using the girlfriend's standards against her in a way that's not collaborative. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
