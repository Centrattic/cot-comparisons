We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over at his place multiple times a week, and they both work at the same company. He wants to move in together, but she refuses because of her Christian community's views. She thinks moving in before marriage is \"trashy\" and \"improper,\" but she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex. He's upset about the double standards and considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own reasoning.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is about hypocrisy and double standards. The author feels that since she's been sleeping over and having sex before marriage, but refuses to move in together, there's a contradiction. He wants to point out the inconsistency by using her own standards to stop the sleepovers. Is he in the wrong for doing that?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are dating for years, living close, same workplace. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, but her actions (sleeping over, having premarital sex) might conflict with those beliefs. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy, which can be a valid point. However, confronting someone with hypocrisy can be seen as a harsh move, especially if the person is not ready for that.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's using her own standards to enforce a change in their behavior, is that justified? He's not being hypocritical because he's not moving in with her; he's just stopping her from staying over. But is this a fair response? It might be a way to hold her accountable for her own standards, but it's also a bit of a manipulation tactic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have a different approach, like discussing the inconsistencies calmly rather than using her beliefs against her. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the best approach. If he's pointing out the double standards, maybe he isn't wrong. However, if he's trying to control her behavior by applying her own beliefs, that could be seen as using her own rules against her, which might not be fair. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's decision not to move in is based on her beliefs, but she's comfortable with sleeping over. The author is highlighting that inconsistency. By stopping the sleepovers, he's applying her standard (improper) to her current behavior. If her beliefs actually don't allow even sleeping over, then he's right. But if her beliefs are more about cohabitation regardless of sleepovers, then there's a gap. But since she's been doing it, maybe her personal standards are different from what she claims. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the question is about whether he's justified in enforcing her standards. If he's not being hypocritical himself and is pointing out the inconsistency, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's using her beliefs to control her, that's a different matter. However, since he's the one initiating the change based on her own criteria, it's a bit of a strategic move. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's highlighting hypocrisy and using her own standards to adjust their relationship dynamics. However, some might argue that using someone's beliefs against them is manipulative. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. In terms of relationship dynamics, it's a complex situation, but based on the reasoning given, B seems plausible.\n"
