We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves differing views on cohabitation and premarital sex within a Christian community.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. The author is frustrated because she claims it's improper to move in together before marriage but continues to sleep over. The author thinks this is a double standard and wants to enforce her own standards by restricting sleepovers.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the girlfriend's standards might not align with her actions. If she's against cohabitation but engages in it, there's inconsistency. The author is pointing out that hypocrisy. However, the author's response\u2014threatening to stop sleepovers based on her standards\u2014could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nThe key factors are mutual respect and communication. The author has a right to express their feelings, but using her own standards against her might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to resentment. Instead, addressing the double standard through dialogue might be more constructive. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but enforcing a rule based on her standards might not be the best solution. The answer hinges on whether retaliating with her own rules is acceptable. Since the user's question is about being in the wrong, the author's actions are a response to perceived hypocrisy, but the method might be questionable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author is responding to inconsistency, but it's still a complex situation where communication is key. However, enforcing restrictions without dialogue could be problematic. But given the options, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard.\n"
