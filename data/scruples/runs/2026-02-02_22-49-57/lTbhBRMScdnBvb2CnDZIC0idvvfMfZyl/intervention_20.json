We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is sleeping over multiple nights a week, but when he suggests moving in together, she refuses because of her Christian beliefs, considering it improper until marriage. The author is upset about the double standards because they're already having sex before marriage and she's sleeping over a lot, so he wants to stop allowing her to do so based on her own criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which implies physical intimacy. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in her stance since she's already engaging in behaviors that might be considered \"improper\" by her standards. The question is whether the author is justified in applying her own standards to deny her from sleeping over anymore.\n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author is frustrated and wants to address the double standard. If the girlfriend's beliefs include premarital cohabitation and sex being improper, then the author is highlighting a contradiction. However, whether this makes him \"wrong\" depends on context. The girlfriend might feel that sleeping over is acceptable as long as they're not married, even if they're having sex. Or maybe she's compartmentalizing her beliefs. The author is using her standards against her, which could be seen as valid if those standards are important to her, but might come off as confrontational.\n\nAlso, consider the cultural or religious context. In some Christian communities, cohabitation is frowned upon, but frequency of sleepovers might be a gray area. The author is essentially saying, \"If you consider it improper until marriage, then you shouldn't sleep over so much.\" The girlfriend's argument is that she's prioritizing time with him, which is a relationship-building aspect, while the author is pushing for a more committed step (moving in together) that she isn't ready for. The author's response (stopping sleepovers) is a way to enforce her own values back at her, which is a bit of a passive-aggressive move. \n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, from their perspective, pointing out the inconsistency is fair. The author is tired of the double standards, and if the girlfriend is applying those standards to the relationship, it's reasonable to hold her to them. However, the author should consider how this might affect the relationship. Using her own values to restrict her might not be the best way to handle it, but in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about respecting mutual agreements and understanding each other's perspectives. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action is a justified response to the inconsistency. If the girlfriend's stance is that cohabitation is improper until marriage, then the author's decision to stop sleepovers isn't wrong in that context. But if there's a different understanding (like they're not considered cohabitation because they're not officially moving in together), then maybe the author is overstepping. Since the scenario mentions \"sleeping over 4+ nights\" as part of their current situation, which is similar to cohabitation, the author is trying to align her actions with her stated beliefs. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
