We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together before marriage, even though they already sleep over frequently. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and he thinks they should move in together. She refuses, citing her Christian values that it's improper before marriage. The author is frustrated by her double standard, given their current level of intimacy, and is considering using her own values to cut off sleepovers.\n\nSo, the author is considering a form of hypocrisy here. She's against cohabitation before marriage but is okay with sleeping over. He's pointing out the inconsistency. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong to use her values against her. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, using someone's beliefs to control or punish them can backfire. It might come off as manipulative. Also, the fact that they already sleep over often suggests they're engaging in physical intimacy, which is another pre-marital act. If she's against cohabitation but not against sleeping over, maybe she's more flexible. The author is trying to enforce her standards, but that could be seen as taking things too far. \n\nHe might be within his right to set boundaries, but the approach could be problematic. Instead of cutting off sleepovers abruptly, maybe a conversation is better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key here is hypocrisy. By her own standards, she's already violating them by sleeping over. If he enforces her rules to stop sleepovers, it's using her standards against her. But maybe he's justified in pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nAlternatively, he could be overreacting. Setting boundaries is okay, but using her beliefs against her might not be healthy. The answer might hinge on whether his action is a legitimate boundary or a form of punishment. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might be A because he's using her values in a way that's controlling. But maybe B because he's addressing hypocrisy. I need to consider if cutting off sleepovers is a fair response or if it's just retaliating.\n"
