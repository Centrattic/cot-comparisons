We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week, and now the author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore because she moved in with him before marriage, which she finds improper. But she also sleeps over a lot and they have had sex before marriage. The author is frustrated with her double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple is in a long-term relationship, living apart but sleeping over frequently. The girlfriend is against moving in together until marriage, citing religious reasons. However, she's been sleeping over multiple nights a week, which the author points out is contradictory. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers as a form of pointing out her inconsistency.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about the dynamics. The author is using the same logic she used against moving in to justify cutting off sleepovers. But sleepovers and moving in together are different. Moving in together is a bigger commitment. The girlfriend might see sleepovers as acceptable within their current relationship, even if moving in is not. Also, the author's action might be seen as punitive or manipulative, using her own standards against her. That could be hurtful and not fair, especially if the author's main issue is her inconsistency. The author could have addressed the inconsistency in communication rather than using it to cut off physical contact. So, the author might be in the wrong by retaliating instead of discussing the issue openly. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's standards are hypocritical, maybe the author is justified. But the key is whether the author's action is fair. Cutting off sleepovers might be a harsh response. The right approach would be to communicate the frustration and discuss boundaries, not to weaponize her own beliefs against her. So, likely answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
