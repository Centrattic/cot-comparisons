We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating for a few years, she's over 4+ nights a week, and they're not in a rush to get married. He wants to move in together, but she refuses because she's from a Christian community that frowns upon living together before marriage. He's upset because she's sleeping over a lot and having sex, which he sees as a contradiction, and he's thinking of using her own standards to cut off her sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical aspects here. The key points are mutual respect, communication, and hypocrisy. The girlfriend is holding to her values, even if they conflict with her actions. The author is frustrated by what he perceives as a double standard. But is it right for him to impose her standards on her own behavior?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if she considers cohabitation before marriage as \"trashy,\" then her current actions (sleeping over and having sex) are inconsistent. He wants to stop her from sleeping over using her own criteria. But is that fair? It might be pointing out the inconsistency, but applying her standards to her actions might not be the right approach. Relationships require compromise, and the author is choosing to enforce her standards while she's not willing to move in. However, does that make him in the wrong?\n\nMaybe the main issue here is communication. The author could be trying to address the double standard constructively, but threatening to stop her from sleeping over because of her own morals is a bit of a passive-aggressive move. It might be more about standing up for his own boundaries rather than punishing her for her standards. However, using her own standards against her could be seen as hypocritical if he's not following them. But he isn't the one moving in. He's just stopping her from sleeping over. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend is choosing to sleep over and have sex, which goes against her own values, the author is trying to enforce those values by cutting off the sleepovers. That might be a way to hold her accountable, but it's a bit of a power play. It's possible that the author is in the wrong if he's using her standards to restrict her behavior in a way that's not mutual. But if he's not willing to move in, why should she? Maybe it's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author is not moving in but is asking her to stop sleeping over. It's a bit of a conflict between their values. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is pointing out the inconsistency, but using her standards to enforce his own boundaries might not be the healthiest approach. However, he's not necessarily in the wrong because he's trying to address the issue based on her own criteria. It's a complex situation where both parties need to communicate better. But based on the question, the answer would be whether he's in the wrong. Since he's responding to her standards, maybe it's a matter of perspective. The answer could be B (No), he's not in the wrong, but some might argue A (Yes) because he's using her values against her. However, since she's the one holding to those values, he's not the one in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. So the answer is B.\n"
