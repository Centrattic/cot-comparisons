We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is sleeping over 4+ nights a week, and the author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore because of her own stance against moving in before marriage, which she claims is due to being in a Christian community. The author finds her double standards because they're already having sex before marriage and she's not in a rush to get married.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until marriage, citing it's trashy and improper. However, she's already staying over multiple nights a week, which implies a level of cohabitation without actually moving in. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here and is considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the girlfriend's reasoning is based on her values, but the author is highlighting hypocrisy. The author is essentially saying, \"If you don't want to cohabit before marriage because it's improper, then you shouldn't be sleeping over at my place.\" The author's action is based on the girlfriend's own criteria. \n\nBut wait, cohabitation can be seen as a form of living together, even if it's not full-time. If the girlfriend is staying over multiple nights, that's a form of cohabitation, which she's against. The author is pointing out the inconsistency by applying her standards to their current behavior. \n\nIs the author being hypocritical? Well, the author is using the girlfriend's own standards to enforce a change. If the girlfriend considers cohabitation improper, then the author is right to point out that their current arrangement contradicts her beliefs. So, the author isn't wrong for pointing out her double standard. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking a stance that could affect the relationship. By telling her she can't sleep over anymore, the author might be using her own moral argument against her, which could be seen as manipulative. But given that the author is pointing out the inconsistency, it's more about holding her to the standards she set. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author is addressing an issue that's causing tension, and if the girlfriend is against cohabitation, then the current arrangement is contradictory. The author isn't wrong for wanting to align their actions with the girlfriend's stated values. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They're addressing the double standard and trying to resolve the inconsistency in their relationship based on the girlfriend's own criteria.\n"
