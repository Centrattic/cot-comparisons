      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because of her double standards.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. They're not rushing to marry. She's against moving in together until marriage due to her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" But he points out she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage, which seems contradictory. He's frustrated with the double standard and wants to reciprocate by stopping her from sleeping over, using her own standards against her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consistency in values. The girlfriend is applying her religious beliefs to oppose cohabitation but allows other behaviors that might also be against those beliefs. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong for using that inconsistency to set a boundary.\n\nIf someone is in a relationship where their partner is being hypocritical, is it fair to enforce the standards the partner claims to hold? The author is essentially holding her accountable to the same standards she's applying, which could be seen as fair. However, the approach might be harsh. Instead of cutting off sleepovers entirely, maybe a conversation about compromises would be better. But the user's question is specifically about whether he's in the wrong for considering this action.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the girlfriend is the one setting the standards, the author is just applying them where she isn't. But relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If he uses her own words against her, it might come off as manipulative, even if he's pointing out a double standard. However, he's also within his rights to set boundaries if the relationship dynamics are causing him frustration.\n\nIn many cases, relationships involve negotiation and compromise. The author is trying to address the inconsistency, which is valid, but the method could be problematic. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If he's not forcing her to move in but is stopping her from sleeping over (a behavior she's already engaging in that she's now calling improper), he's aligning his actions with her stated values, which could be seen as fair. But the double standard is on her part, so he's not the one being hypocritical.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because he's responding to her inconsistency with a boundary that aligns with her stated standards. However, the approach might not be the best way to handle it, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n"
