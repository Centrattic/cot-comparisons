      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been dating for a few years, and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work at the same company and live close by. He thinks it makes sense to move in together, but she doesn't want to because of her Christian community's views on premarital cohabitation. However, she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex, which the author points out as a double standard. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is questioning whether he's in the wrong if he enforces a rule based on her own stated standards. The key here is the concept of hypocrisy. She's against moving in together because it's \"trashy and improper,\" but she's already sleeping over frequently and having sex. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in her stance.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using her standards against her. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are important. If she's using her moral standards to influence the relationship, but the author feels she's being hypocritical, he might be justified in addressing that. However, using her own standards to cut off her sleepovers could be seen as using her logic against her, which might not be fair if the standards weren't mutually agreed upon.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author is not just applying her standards, he's pointing out the inconsistency. If she's against cohabitation for moral reasons, but is engaging in cohabitation through frequent sleepovers and sex, then he's highlighting a contradiction. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. However, the approach of suddenly cutting off sleepovers might be abrupt and could cause more conflict. The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is the best.\n\nIn terms of moral high ground, if she's the one who brought up the standards, and he's using them to enforce boundaries, maybe he's not in the wrong. But relationships require compromise. If she's made up her mind about not moving in, but is engaging in premarital cohabitation, that's her choice. The author is responding to that by saying, \"If your standards are so important, then you need to follow through on them.\" That could be valid. However, relationships are about negotiation. If he's not comfortable with the double standard, he has a right to express that. \n\nBut is he in the wrong for enforcing a standard she set? If he's using her own words against her, maybe he is. Because if she didn't want to live together, but is choosing to sleep over, he's making a point that if her standards are important, then she should adhere to them. But if he's using her standards to control the relationship, that could be a problem. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require both parties to agree on boundaries. If she's the one pushing the standards, but not following them, the author is justified in pointing that out. However, cutting off sleepovers abruptly might not be the best approach, but the question is about being in the wrong, not the approach's effectiveness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's responding to a perceived inconsistency in her behavior based on her own stated standards. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
