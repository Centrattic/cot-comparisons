I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating for years, she stays over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. He wants to move in together, but she refuses until marriage, citing Christian values about it being \"trashy and improper.\" He's frustrated because she's sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage, so he's considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are mutual standards and consistency. She's using her religious beliefs to set boundaries, but her actions (sleeping over frequently) seem to conflict with those beliefs. The author is pointing out the double standard. However, when he decides to enforce her standards against her, is that fair?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if she values marriage before cohabitation, then her current behavior (sleeping over often) also goes against those standards. So he's applying the same logic she used against her. The question is whether it's right to enforce her standards on her when she's already violating them in other ways. Also, is it fair to set a boundary based on her beliefs when she's not applying them consistently?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might be reacting out of frustration with her inconsistency. However, using her own standards to cut off sleepovers might be seen as holding her to a strict standard while ignoring her own actions. It could be hypocritical of him to do that if he's okay with the sleepovers otherwise. But he's also pointing out her inconsistency, so maybe he's justified in holding her to the standards she claims to value.\n\nAnother angle: If both partners are in agreement about the rules, that's one thing. But if there's a disagreement, it's about mutual respect. The author might be in the wrong if he's using her beliefs to enforce a boundary she hasn't agreed to, especially if he's not applying the same to himself. Alternatively, he's highlighting her inconsistency, which could be fair.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's sleeping over so much but not moving in together creates a situation where they're living separately but sharing a home. The author might feel it's unfair that she's living a double standard. But cutting off sleepovers suddenly because of her beliefs could be seen as punitive. It might be better to address the inconsistency through discussion rather than an ultimatum.\n\nIn summary, the author is pointing out her inconsistency, but enforcing her standards might not be the right approach. The issue is about mutual respect and whether the author's action is a fair response to her double standards. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author might be in the wrong because he's using her standards against her in a way that's not constructive, especially if he's not applying the same to himself. However, if both are in agreement, but she's not moving in despite frequent sleepovers, maybe he's justified. But since he's the one making the decision unilaterally, it's possible he's in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
