We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together before marriage, citing Christian values. The author is frustrated because she's okay with sleeping over and having sex but not moving in together. The author considers cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's stance is based on religious beliefs that premarital cohabitation is improper. However, she's already sleeping over frequently and having sex, which the author points out as a double standard. The author is trying to hold her to the same standards she sets, which is a valid point because if she considers it trashy to move in before marriage, then the frequent sleepovers and sex also fall under that same moral framework. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. In some Christian communities, sleeping over might be seen as equivalent to cohabitation, which is also frowned upon. However, the girlfriend might be justifying the sleepovers as part of their relationship without it being a full move-in. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing the same standards. The author isn't trying to punish her but is highlighting the double standard. If the author uses the girlfriend's own reasoning to set boundaries, that's fair. But if the author is being hypocritical or using it to control her, that could be problematic. However, the scenario suggests the author is reacting to the girlfriend's inconsistency. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions (sleeping over, having sex) might not align with her stated values, so the author is pointing out the hypocrisy. The key is whether the author is applying the same standards consistently. Since the author is using the girlfriend's own criteria against her to make a point about the double standard, the author is not wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
