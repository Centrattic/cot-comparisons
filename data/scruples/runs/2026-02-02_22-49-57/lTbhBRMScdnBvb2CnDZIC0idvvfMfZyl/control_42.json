We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, they work together, live close. They were talking about moving in together, but she decided against it until marriage because her Christian community frowns upon it. He's upset because he thinks her stance is hypocritical given how much they already spend time together and have sex before marriage. He's considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's action is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual respect in relationships, consistency in values, and how to handle disagreements. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her religious beliefs, which she's applying to oppose moving in together. However, the author feels she's being inconsistent because their current arrangement already involves sleeping together and spending a lot of time together. He's frustrated and wants to use her own standards to push back by stopping the sleepovers.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the girlfriend is holding a position based on her beliefs, the author should address it respectfully. Using her standards to retaliate might be seen as manipulative or using the same judgment she's applying. Also, if they're both in a committed relationship, they should work together to find a solution that respects both their values. The author's approach of cutting off sleepovers unilaterally could be seen as a power move rather than a collaborative solution. It might harm the relationship by creating resentment. Instead, discussing the inconsistencies and seeking a compromise would be more constructive. Therefore, the author's method is questionable, making him in the wrong.\n"
