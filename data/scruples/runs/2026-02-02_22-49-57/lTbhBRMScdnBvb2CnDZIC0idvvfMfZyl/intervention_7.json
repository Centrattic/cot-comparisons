We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who have been dating for years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they work at the same company. They live close, and the guy thinks moving in together makes sense. The girl, however, says she doesn't want to move in until they're married because it's \"trashy\" and \"improper\" in her Christian community. The guy is upset because she's applying double standards, given how much time they spend together and their sexual relationship before marriage. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own criteria against her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girl's stance is religious-based, but she's already sleeping over frequently and having sex. The guy feels she's being judgmental and inconsistent. He's frustrated and wants to enforce the same standards she's applying. Is that fair?\n\nFrom an ethical perspective, both parties need to communicate and respect each other's values. If the girl has religious objections to cohabitation but is okay with other pre-marital activities, that's a conflict. The guy is pointing out the inconsistency, which is valid. However, using her own arguments to set a boundary might be a way to level the playing field. But is it fair to cut off sleepovers as a response to her standards?\n\nThe guy's main issue is the hypocrisy he perceives. If moving in together is considered improper, then so might other aspects of their current relationship. By applying her standards, he's trying to address the inconsistency. However, doing so might be seen as using her reasoning against her, which could escalate conflict. But from his perspective, it's about fairness.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no right or wrong in personal relationships, but ethically, it's about mutual respect and understanding. If both are not meeting each other's expectations, then it's a matter of negotiation. The guy's action could be seen as standing up for himself, but it might also be hurtful. However, since he's pointing out the inconsistency and applying the same standards, it's a form of holding her accountable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the standards are mutually agreed upon, then enforcing them makes sense. But if she's the only one enforcing her religious standards while he's not, then he's justified in challenging that. The answer hinges on whether the guy is being fair in pointing out her inconsistency. Since she's the one who set the standard, and he's applying it, he's not wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
