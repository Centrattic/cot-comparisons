We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their living arrangements and differing views on cohabitation before marriage, especially within a Christian context.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They've been dating a few years, she sleeps over frequently, and they work together. The author thinks moving in together is logical given their living situation, but she refuses, citing it's trashy and improper until marriage. The author is frustrated by what he sees as double standards, especially since they already have a sexual relationship. He's considering using her own standards to cut off sleepovers.\n\nThe main issue here is about mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, even though she's comfortable with other intimate aspects. The author feels her position is inconsistent. Now, if he uses her own reasoning to stop sleepovers, is that fair?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, both parties should communicate openly. The author might be justified in pointing out the inconsistency, but cutting off sleepovers abruptly could be seen as retaliatory. However, if the girlfriend is using her beliefs to dictate their relationship's boundaries, the author is within his rights to adjust his behavior in response. It's about mutual respect and whether both are willing to compromise. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries based on her own criteria, but the approach matters. However, the question is specifically about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually implies a moral or ethical breach. Since he's responding to her stated values, it's more of a conflict in values than a clear-cut wrong.\n"
