She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together before marriage, even though they already sleep over frequently. The author is conflicted between her religious beliefs and their current behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which the author sees as a step towards moving in together. She's against moving in together until marriage due to her Christian community's views, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds her stance judgmental because they're already having sex and sleeping over, which he thinks contradicts her standards. He's considering using her own criteria to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLooking at the situation, the core issue is hypocrisy or double standards. The girlfriend's beliefs against cohabitation before marriage might conflict with her current actions. The author is pointing out that if her standards are so strict, then her current behavior (sleeping over frequently) is also against those standards. So, if he applies her logic consistently, he's using her own rules against her. \n\nBut is it fair for him to do that? Well, the author is tired of her double standards. By enforcing her own standards, he's trying to hold her accountable. However, this could be seen as using her own words against her in a way that might cause conflict or hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, communication is key here. If they're discussing this, maybe the author should have a conversation to express his concerns rather than just cutting off sleepovers abruptly. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for taking that action. \n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong. I need to consider if applying the same standard back is a valid approach. If the girlfriend's standards are against cohabitation, then her current behavior does violate that. So the author isn't wrong to question her consistency. However, the way he addresses it (telling her she can't sleep over) might be harsh. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. \n\nIn terms of moral or ethical wrong, the author isn't violating any laws or generally accepted social norms. He's holding her to her stated beliefs, which she's the one who emphasized. So B (not in the wrong) seems correct.\n"
