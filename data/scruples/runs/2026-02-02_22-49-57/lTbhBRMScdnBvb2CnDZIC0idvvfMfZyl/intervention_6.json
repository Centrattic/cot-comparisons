We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week at his place, and he's considering telling her she can't anymore because she doesn't want to move in together until marriage, citing religious reasons. The author thinks her stance is judgmental and wants to apply her own standard back at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. They've been dating for a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and there's been discussion about moving in together. She's against moving in until marriage due to Christian values, but she's also engaging in sexual activity. The author is frustrated with the double standards and wants to enforce her own standards by cutting off sleepovers.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. The user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong, but they want my perspective.\n\nI should think about mutual respect and communication in relationships. If both partners are aware of each other's boundaries and have agreed on something, then changing those terms without discussion could be problematic. However, the girlfriend is setting a boundary about moving in together, but the author is pointing out that her current behavior (sleeping over, having sex) might contradict her values. The author is trying to highlight the inconsistency, which can be a valid point if communication is open.\n\nBut then, if the author suddenly decides to stop sleepovers as a form of punishment or to make a point, that might be seen as unfair or a manipulation tactic. Relationships require negotiation and compromise. If the author hasn't discussed this with her and just imposes a rule based on her own standards, it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the author is using her stated values to challenge her current behavior, it's a conversation about consistency rather than punishment.\n\nAlso, the author is getting tired of her double standards, which is a reasonable feeling. The key here is whether the author is enforcing a boundary based on mutual agreement or using her own words against her without prior discussion. If the author hasn't talked to her about this and is just acting unilaterally, that's where the issue might be. But if he's using her own stated beliefs to argue for consistency, it's more about holding her accountable, which is fair in a relationship where both partners should be transparent about their expectations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of stopping sleepovers is a response to her own stated values, aiming for consistency. It might be a harsh move, but if both parties are aware of each other's boundaries and the author is using her own standards to challenge her behavior, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The problem is whether the author is acting without dialogue, but the question says he's \"getting tired of these double standards,\" suggesting that this is a decision he's making based on frustration, not just a sudden, unprovoked action.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be justified in pointing out the inconsistency, but the method of enforcing it could be problematic if done without discussion. However, since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and given the context, the answer likely leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is responding to the girlfriend's own stated values and seeking consistency.\n"
