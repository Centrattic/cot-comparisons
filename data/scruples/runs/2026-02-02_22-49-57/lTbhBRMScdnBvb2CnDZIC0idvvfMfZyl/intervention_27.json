We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend who sleeps over four nights a week and doesn't want to move in together until marriage because her Christian community frowns on it. The author is upset about the double standard and wants to stop her from sleeping over because, according to her own standards, it's improper.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend is sleeping over frequently but refuses to move in together. The author points out that she's already staying over a lot, including having sex before marriage, which contradicts her stance against living together pre-marriage. The author wants to cut off her sleepovers, using her own standards as a justification.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want to know if I agree. The key points are about double standards and the author's response. Is it fair for the author to enforce her standards on her? The girlfriend is the one who's making the moral judgment, but the author is reacting to that with their own actions.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. The author is pointing out inconsistencies. However, cutting off sleepovers might be a harsh reaction. But maybe the author is trying to hold her accountable. But is the author allowed to do that? The girlfriend's standards affect the relationship's terms, but the author is also setting boundaries now. The question is whether enforcing her own standards by the boyfriend is fair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because the girlfriend's standards aren't being consistently applied. If she's already sleeping over and having sex, then moving in together is just an extension. The author is challenging her inconsistency. But using her own reasoning to limit her presence might be a valid way to highlight the hypocrisy.\n\nBut is it right for the author to impose his decision based on her standards? The girlfriend might feel it's unfair if the author is not following through with her reasoning. However, the author is using her own moral framework to set boundaries. It's a bit of a paradox. The author is correct in pointing out the inconsistency, but the action of cutting off sleepovers could be seen as using her own rules against her, which might be justified if the relationship isn't balanced.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. If the author is doing this to make a point, it might be a necessary step, but it's a bit of a power move. However, the girlfriend's stance is causing conflict, so the author's response is a way to address the issue. The author isn't being hypocritical since he's not moving in either; he's just restricting her presence. So perhaps the author is not in the wrong because he's challenging her double standards and setting a boundary based on her own criteria.\n"
