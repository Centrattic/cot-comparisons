We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and the author wants to stop allowing her to sleep over because she said moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" due to being in a Christian community. The author is pointing out a double standard since they're already sleeping together and she's there often.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, which she uses to justify not moving in together before marriage. However, she's already sleeping over multiple nights a week and having sex. The author is calling out the inconsistency here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is following her own rules but pointing out hypocrisy. If the girlfriend's beliefs are important to her, then the author is right to question the double standard. But does that mean the author is in the wrong for enforcing it by stopping her from sleeping over? The author's action could be seen as holding her to her own stated principles, which might be fair. However, relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author is choosing to enforce his own decision based on her values, which might be a bit of a trap. \n\nBut maybe the author is using her own arguments against her, which is a logical move. However, in practice, this could come off as manipulative. The key is whether the author is respecting her boundaries. If the girlfriend is okay with sleeping over but not moving in, maybe the author is overcorrecting. But since she's already violating the same standards by sleeping over, the author's action is a valid response to the inconsistency. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether enforcing her stated standards is fair. Since she's already not following those standards in part (sleeping over and having sex), the author's action is pointing out hypocrisy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's applying her own principles. The answer is B.\n"
