We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend doesn't want to move in together before marriage, citing Christian beliefs against cohabitation. The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, pointing out her double standards because she already sleeps over 4+ nights a week and they've had sex before marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend is against cohabitation but is already staying over frequently. The author feels she's being judgmental for not moving in but is okay with sleeping over. The author is frustrated and wants to set boundaries based on her own standards.\n\nIs the author in the wrong if he stops her from sleeping over? Well, the key points are mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, but her actions (sleeping over) contradict her values. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. However, using her own standards to restrict her behavior might not be fair if he's not applying the same rules to himself. Also, relationships require compromise. If the author is not moving in but continues to sleep with her, that's also a contradiction. The author's threat might be a way to pressure her, but it's possible he's being hypocritical. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not addressing his own inconsistencies and is using her beliefs to justify his actions, which could be manipulative. Alternatively, he's trying to set boundaries. But the main issue is that both parties have double standards. The answer might be A because the author is using her beliefs against her in a way that's hypocritical, given his own actions. But I need to think if there's a better angle. Maybe the author is justified in calling out her inconsistency. But the problem is that the author is applying her standards to himself, which might not be appropriate. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, in relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. If the author is consistent and both are being hypocritical, maybe the wrong lies in not addressing their own issues. So I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong because he's using her beliefs to justify his actions without addressing his own inconsistencies.\n"
