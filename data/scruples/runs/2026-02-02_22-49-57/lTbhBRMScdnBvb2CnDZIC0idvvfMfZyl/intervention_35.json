We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about the author considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together before marriage, calling it \"trashy and improper\" due to her Christian community's views. But she continues to sleep over and have sex, which the author sees as a double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is frowned upon, so she sleeps over at his place often. The author feels frustrated because she's against cohabitation but is okay with other premarital activities. He's considering using her own standards to cut off her sleepovers.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement. In a relationship, both partners should agree on boundaries. If the girlfriend is comfortable with sleeping over and having sex, that's their mutual choice. But when she says moving in together is improper, maybe she's trying to maintain a boundary. The author, on the other hand, feels her actions contradict her words, leading to hypocrisy.\n\nNow, the author is thinking of using her criteria to stop the sleepovers. That might not be fair because he's essentially punishing her by cutting off something she's okay with, based on her own judgment. However, her inconsistency in beliefs (against cohabitation but okay with other premarital activities) might be the real issue here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's enforcing her standards to restrict her actions, that could be seen as hypocritical or unfair. Alternatively, if he's pointing out the inconsistency and adjusting his behavior accordingly, maybe not. But the act of telling her she can't sleep over anymore because of her own standards might be a form of using her beliefs against her, which could be manipulative.\n\nAlso, communication is key. They've been talking about this, so maybe the author should address the inconsistency directly instead of abruptly changing the rules. If he's frustrated, he should express his feelings without necessarily cutting off something she's comfortable with unless there's mutual agreement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require compromise. The author might not be in the wrong if he's standing up for his feelings about hypocrisy, but acting on it by cutting off sleepovers without discussion could be problematic. It could be seen as using her own values against her to control the situation, which isn't healthy.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's enforcing her standards in a way that might not be fair, especially if she's not applying them consistently. Alternatively, B (Not in the wrong) if he's addressing a double standard. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong when he enforces her standards, the answer could be A because it's not his place to enforce her beliefs unless they mutually agree.\n"
