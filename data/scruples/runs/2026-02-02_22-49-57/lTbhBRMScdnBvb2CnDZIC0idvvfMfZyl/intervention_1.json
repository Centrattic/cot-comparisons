We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The scenario involves their living arrangements and differing views on pre-marital cohabitation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, but now she's decided they shouldn't move in together until marriage because it's \"trashy\" in her Christian community. The author feels double standards because they're already sleeping together and she's okay with that. He's considering using her own standards to limit her sleepovers.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I should consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious values, which she's communicated. The author is pointing out inconsistency since she's comfortable with frequent overnight stays and other physical intimacy. \n\nIs the author justified in applying her standards to his rules? If he's using her reasoning against her, that could be hypocritical. But he's also pointing out her inconsistency. However, making a rule based on her beliefs without mutual agreement might be a problem. Relationships require compromise. By unilaterally changing the rules, he might be imposing his own judgment, even if it's based on her own standards. \n\nAlso, the author's action (telling her she can't sleep over) is a response to her double standards, but it's a form of punishment, which might not address the underlying issue. They need to communicate and find a middle ground. The author could be in the wrong if he's using her standards to manipulate rather than discussing their future together. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether applying her standards is fair. Since he's not respecting her wishes and is retaliating, maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's highlighting hypocrisy, perhaps not. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the key is whether the author is respecting her values while also expressing his own. He might not be in the wrong, but the approach could be better. However, based on the question, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because he's reacting to her inconsistency.\n"
