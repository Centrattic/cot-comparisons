We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they're in a long-term relationship, she stays over a lot, and he's frustrated because she says she doesn't want to move in together until marriage due to her Christian values. But she's been staying over so much that he feels it's contradictory. He's considering using her own standards to cut off the sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper,\" which is her value system. However, she's already staying over multiple nights a week and having sex before marriage. So the author is pointing out a double standard. He's upset because her actions don't align with her stated beliefs. \n\nThe author's plan is to apply her own standards to stop the sleepovers. But is that fair? Well, if the girlfriend is okay with staying over but not moving in together, maybe she sees a difference. Maybe she believes that sleeping over occasionally versus living together is different. Or perhaps she's not consistent in her values. \n\nBut the author is using her reasoning against her, which might not be the best approach. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. Even if there's a double standard, cutting off sleepovers without discussion could be seen as punitive. The author might be reacting out of frustration and trying to hold her to her own standards, but that could lead to conflict. \n\nAlso, moving in together is a big step, and some people do choose to sleep over frequently without cohabiting. The girlfriend might have personal reasons for not wanting to move in together yet, even if her actions seem contradictory. The author's main issue is feeling like she's being judgmental while engaging in the same behavior. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If he's pointing out inconsistencies, he's not necessarily wrong. But threatening to stop sleepovers because of her values might not be constructive. Instead of making a unilateral decision, discussing the issue and finding a compromise might be better. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but his approach could be problematic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering cutting off sleepovers. If he's using her standards to do that, it's a bit of a trap. But since she's the one who set the standard, he's not entirely wrong to hold her accountable. But maybe there's a better way. \n\nHmm. The key here is whether applying her standards to his actions is fair. Since she's the one who set the standard, but her actions don't align, he's in a position to highlight that. However, using her reasoning to cut off sleepovers might not be fair because he's using her words against her. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is using her own beliefs to enforce a change, is that wrong? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundaries or their current dynamic. But she's the one who set the rules about moving in together, so maybe he's justified in pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's not in the wrong for noticing the inconsistency. However, the way he's handling it might be an issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is the best. Since he's pointing out her double standard, he's not wrong in that regard. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
