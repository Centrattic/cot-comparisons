I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the question) is in the wrong if they decide to stop letting their girlfriend sleep over after she expressed certain views.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, they work together and live close. They were considering moving in together, but she now says she doesn't want to because of religious reasons (Christian community) and thinks it's improper. The author feels this is a double standard since they're already sharing a bed, and is considering cutting off the sleepovers based on her own standards. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual expectations, communication, and the double standard. The girlfriend changed her stance on moving in but continues to sleep over. The author is reacting to her inconsistency. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should have mutual respect and compromise. If one person's beliefs are important to them, the other needs to respect that unless it's causing harm. But here, the girlfriend is applying her standards to the author, which the author finds hypocritical. The author is considering holding her to the same standard she applies to herself. \n\nIs it fair for the author to enforce her standards? It's a bit of a dilemma. The author might feel that if she can't move in together but continues to sleep over, it's inconsistent. The author's response is to stop the sleepovers, which could be seen as a way to enforce her own belief that sleeping over is improper. \n\nHowever, the author should consider whether this decision is about fairness or a reaction to the girlfriend's double standard. The author's main issue is the inconsistency in her stance, so cutting off sleepovers to reflect her own standards could be seen as a way to highlight the hypocrisy. But is that the right approach?\n\nIn terms of ethics, both should have the right to their beliefs as long as they don't harm the other. The author is applying her standards to the author, which might not be fair if the author doesn't share those beliefs. However, if the author is using her own reasoning (her standards) against her, maybe that's a way to point out the inconsistency. \n\nBut is it the author's place to enforce the girlfriend's standards? The girlfriend's belief is about moving in before marriage, but sleeping over is a different situation. The author might be trying to create equality by applying her standards to himself. However, the author might be in the wrong if he's using her standards to change his behavior instead of addressing the root of the problem through communication. \n\nAlternatively, the author is justified in pointing out the inconsistency, but using her own standards against her could be seen as a form of punishment or manipulation. It might escalate the conflict rather than resolve it. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's action could be seen as a valid response to the inconsistency but might not be the healthiest way to handle it. The right answer here depends on whether enforcing mutual respect and consistency is considered right or if it's overstepping. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is using the girlfriend's own standards to make a point about hypocrisy, then maybe it's a fair approach. However, if the author is not respecting the girlfriend's beliefs, he might be in the wrong. Since the author is reacting to the girlfriend's own stated standards, perhaps he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
