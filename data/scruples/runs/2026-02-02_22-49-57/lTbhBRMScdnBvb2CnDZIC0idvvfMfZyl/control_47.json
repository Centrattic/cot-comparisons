I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, work together, live nearby. They were talking about moving in together, but she doesn't want to until they're married because of Christian beliefs. The author feels she's being judgmental since they already sleep together and see each other a lot, and wants to enforce her standards by cutting off sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper,\" which is part of her Christian community's values. The author is pointing out the double standard because she's already staying over multiple nights, implying that the current arrangement isn't in line with her own standards. He's considering using her reasoning against her to stop the sleepovers.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To answer this, I need to consider the ethical implications, communication in relationships, and mutual respect. The author is reacting to perceived hypocrisy in the girlfriend's behavior. If she's against cohabitation before marriage, but is currently staying over multiple times a week, there's inconsistency. The author is trying to hold her to her own standards, which could be seen as fair, but there's also the aspect of how he's enforcing it.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might be confrontational. Instead of addressing the issue through open communication and negotiation, he's considering a sudden cutoff, which could hurt the relationship. The girlfriend's reasons are based on her beliefs, even if there's inconsistency. The author might be right in pointing out the inconsistency, but the method of responding could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's decision to not move in together until marriage might be personal, even if she's not moving in. The key is whether the sleepovers are considered cohabitation. If she's not moving in but just staying over, maybe her community considers that different. But if multiple nights a week is equivalent to cohabitation, then her stance is inconsistent. The author is trying to apply her standards to his actions, which could be justified, but the way he does it matters.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author might be if he's using her words against her in a way that's manipulative or without considering her perspective. Alternatively, if she's being hypocritical, he's pointing that out. The bigger issue is whether they can compromise. The author might not be in the wrong if he's standing up for his own boundaries, especially if he's uncomfortable with the double standard. But cutting off sleepovers abruptly could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might depend on the relationship dynamics and communication.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be B (No), because the author is highlighting a double standard and setting boundaries based on her own criteria. However, the approach could be better handled through discussion rather than a sudden cutoff. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is optimal. Since he's pointing out her inconsistency, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
