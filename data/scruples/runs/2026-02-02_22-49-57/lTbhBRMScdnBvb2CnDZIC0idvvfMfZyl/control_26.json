We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend is sleeping over at his place multiple times a week, and he's suggesting moving in together. She doesn't want to move in until marriage because it's \"trashy\" and improper due to their Christian community. But he's pointing out the hypocrisy since they already sleep together and she's there a lot. He's considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the moral or ethical standards here. She's against cohabitation before marriage but is already spending a lot of time at his place. The author is frustrated by what he sees as double standards. If she's against cohabitation, then perhaps she's being inconsistent by sleeping over so frequently. The author is using her reasoning against her to set boundaries.\n\nBut is that fair? The question is whether he's in the wrong if he tells her she can't sleep over. The key points are: both are making decisions based on their values. She has her reasons rooted in her religious beliefs, even if they conflict with her current behavior. The author is reacting to her inconsistency. But if he's using her own standards to cut off her visits, does that make sense?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might feel that she's being hypocritical, but confronting her by cutting off visits might not be the best approach. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is the best. If she's against cohabitation, then his argument is that continuing to sleep over is also against her standards. So, according to her logic, maybe he's right to enforce it. But does that mean he's in the right? Or is he just retaliating?\n\nAnother angle: The author is using her own moral standards against her. If she doesn't want to cohabit, then perhaps he's correct in saying that sleeping over is also cohabiting, hence improper. But maybe the line between sleeping over occasionally versus living together isn't clear. However, in their case, she's there 4+ nights a week, which is a lot. So maybe he's pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nBut is it his place to enforce her standards? That's tricky. The author is choosing to follow his own values, and she's following hers. If he's using her reasoning to stop her from coming over, does that align with respecting her values? Or is he manipulating her own values to push his agenda?\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is being hypocritical himself by not moving in together but sleeping over, but she's the one who set the standard. So perhaps he's not in the wrong because he's applying her own beliefs to the situation. However, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If he's using her standards to make a point, maybe it's a valid approach, but it's also a form of confrontation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's using her own standards to set boundaries, then he's not necessarily wrong. It's about consistency. However, the way he's doing it might be harsh. But the question isn't about the best approach but whether he's in the wrong. Since she's the one who set the standard against cohabitation, and he's acting on that, he might be justified. So the answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
