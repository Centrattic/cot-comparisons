We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their living arrangements and differing views on cohabitation before marriage, especially within a Christian context.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over multiple nights a week, which the author sees as a step toward moving in together. She says she doesn't want to move in until marriage because it's frowned upon in her community. The author is pointing out a double standard since they already engage in other activities (like having sex) that are also considered improper before marriage. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers to hold her to her own standards.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consistency and mutual respect. The author is highlighting inconsistency in her stance. If she's against cohabitation but is okay with other pre-marital activities, the author is questioning that. However, using her own standards to cut off sleepovers might be seen as a form of accountability, but could also be seen as manipulative or cutting off communication abruptly.\n\nBut wait, the author's intention here is to enforce her own standards, not to punish her. However, the act of suddenly stopping sleepovers without discussion might be harsh. The better approach might have been to talk through the inconsistencies and see if they can find a compromise. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action, not whether the action itself is the best approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and communication. If the author is pointing out the double standard and setting boundaries based on her own values, that's not inherently wrong. However, if the author is using this as a threat or to control the relationship dynamics, it could be problematic. The scenario suggests the author is frustrated with the double standard and wants to hold her accountable, which is a valid concern but the method of addressing it might be. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author is trying to address a perceived inconsistency, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe it's A (Yes) because enforcing her standards might not be his place. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. But given that the author is responding to her own stated values, it's B.\n"
