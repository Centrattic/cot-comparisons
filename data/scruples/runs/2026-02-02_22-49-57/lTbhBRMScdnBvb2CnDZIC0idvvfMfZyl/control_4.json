She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore based on her own religious standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they're not in a rush to marry. She's against moving in together because of Christian values, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" But the author is pointing out the double standard since they're already having sex and she's staying over so much. The author wants to enforce her own standards by stopping the sleepovers.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about double standards and the use of religious beliefs. The girlfriend's reasoning seems contradictory because she's maintaining a relationship that involves physical intimacy but avoids cohabitation. The author is reacting to that inconsistency by applying her own standards back at her. \n\nIs it fair for the author to use her own values against her? Well, if she's the one who set the standard, then the author is just holding her to it. But maybe there's more nuance. The author might be using her argument to push back against what they see as judgmental behavior. However, cutting off sleepovers abruptly could affect the relationship dynamics and their personal relationship, not just the religious aspect. \n\nAlso, communication is a big part here. They've discussed moving in together before, so the author's response is a reaction to her stance. The author's action might be seen as a way to enforce mutual respect and consistency, but it could also be seen as a power play. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author is pointing out the double standard and using her own criteria to set boundaries, it's a valid point. However, relationships require mutual agreement and compromise. The author's decision to stop sleepovers might be a consequence of the girlfriend's own standards, so maybe it's not entirely their fault. But they could also be overstepping by enforcing her beliefs through actions that affect the relationship. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is highlighting the inconsistency in her partner's beliefs. But I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe the author has a right to express their frustration, but the action might not be fair if it's intended to punish her. However, since the girlfriend set the terms, the author is just applying logic to her own standards. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
