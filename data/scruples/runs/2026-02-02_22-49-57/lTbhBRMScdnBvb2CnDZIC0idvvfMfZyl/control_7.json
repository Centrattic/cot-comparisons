We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to stop their girlfriend from sleeping over because she says moving in together is \"trashy\" due to her Christian values, even though they're already sleeping together regularly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple has been dating for years, and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live nearby. The main conflict is that she doesn't want to move in together until marriage because of religious beliefs, but she's already sleeping over multiple times a week, which the author sees as a double standard.\n\nThe author is frustrated with her double standards and is considering using her own reasoning (that it's trashy/improper) to stop her from sleeping over. The key here is whether the author's response is justified.\n\nChristianity, depending on the denomination, may have varying views on premarital cohabitation. Some conservative Christian communities do frown upon it. However, sleeping over multiple times a week could be seen as a form of cohabitation or at least a step towards it. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together is improper, but she's already in a relationship where they're intimate before marriage, which the author points out as a contradiction.\n\nThe author's response would be using her own moral standards against her. Is this valid? Well, the author is pointing out the inconsistency, but using her own reasoning to cut off the current arrangement might be seen as retaliatory. However, the author is also highlighting a double standard, which could be a legitimate point. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend is against moving in together based on her beliefs, but the author is now applying the same logic to stop her from sleeping over, that could be seen as using her own rules against her. However, the author is also pointing out that her standards are inconsistent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have a point in questioning the double standard, but using that to suddenly cut off sleepovers could be abrupt and hurtful. The core issue is the inconsistency in her values and how the author is responding to it. The author's action might not be in the wrong because they're holding her to her own standards, but it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is trying to make her live by her own standards, maybe not. But if the author is being hypocritical or not addressing the issue constructively, maybe yes. However, the author's main argument is about the double standard, so using her own reasoning against her could be a fair point. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
