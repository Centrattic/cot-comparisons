We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore after she said moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" due to their Christian community's views. The author is frustrated because she sleeps over frequently and they even have sex, yet she's against cohabitation. He's considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, which she applies selectively. She's against moving in together but not against sleeping over, which is essentially the same living arrangement in a different setting. The author is pointing out her inconsistency. However, he's planning to use her reasoning to cut off her visits, which could be seen as hypocritical if he's applying her standards where she didn't. But wait, is he? He's using her criteria against her. \n\nNext, the social norms. In many Christian communities, premarital cohabitation is indeed frowned upon, but sleeping over might be more accepted, especially in a committed relationship. The girlfriend's argument might not hold if the community's stance is more about moving in together rather than occasional or frequent overnight stays. The author is pointing this out, highlighting her double standard.\n\nThe key issue here is consistency. The girlfriend doesn't apply her standards consistently, and the author is trying to bring that to her attention by enforcing her own rules. However, using her religious standards to limit her visits could be seen as using her own beliefs against her, which might not be fair. But if her standards are inconsistent, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing that out.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author mentions they've been talking about moving in together. The girlfriend's refusal is based on her beliefs, but the author feels it's a double standard. The author's response is to stop her from sleeping over, which is a form of applying the same logic she used. If her argument is that moving in together is improper, then sleeping over is essentially the same in terms of intimacy and cohabitation. So, by her own logic, maybe both should be avoided. But she's not applying that, hence the inconsistency.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to address hypocrisy. But using her standards to enforce his own actions might be seen as manipulative. However, if he's consistent in his actions based on her stated beliefs, maybe it's justified. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: If the author is pointing out her inconsistency by applying her own standards, he's not necessarily wrong. He's challenging her to be consistent in her beliefs. However, if he's using her beliefs to control the relationship in a way that's not mutually agreed, that could be problematic. But since she's the one who set the standard, he's using her own words against her, which might make him not in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
