We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves the girlfriend sleeping over 4+ nights a week, and she wants to wait until marriage to move in together because of her Christian beliefs about it being improper. The author is frustrated with her double standards since they're already having sex and she's there often. The author is thinking of using her own reasoning against her to stop the sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs that moving in together before marriage is trashy and improper. However, she's already staying over multiple nights a week, which is similar to cohabitation, and they're having sex. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here and wants to apply her standards to their current situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's argument is that if her beliefs make moving in together improper, then by the same logic, sleeping over multiple nights a week (which is essentially cohabiting) is also improper. So, the author wants to enforce those standards by stopping the sleepovers. \n\nBut is it fair for the author to do that? Well, the author is using the girlfriend's own standards against her. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together is improper, but she's already cohabiting in a different form. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy here. However, the author might be overstepping by demanding an immediate change. The girlfriend might not see the connection between moving in together and sleeping over 4+ nights, even though they both involve cohabitation. \n\nBut the author's action here is to enforce the same standard the girlfriend set. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage, then the author is applying that standard to their current behavior. The author isn't just pointing out the inconsistency but is taking action based on it, which could be seen as using the girlfriend's own rules against her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated and wants to address the double standards. The girlfriend's reasoning is inconsistent because sleeping over regularly is similar to cohabitation. The author is trying to hold her to her own standards. However, the author might be misinterpreting the girlfriend's stance. Maybe the girlfriend differentiates between occasional sleepovers and moving in together. But the author is equating the two. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach of threatening to stop sleepovers unless the girlfriend changes her stance could be seen as coercive. Instead of using the girlfriend's own reasoning to enforce a change, they should discuss the inconsistencies and find a mutual understanding. \n\nSo, the author's action is not in the wrong because they are highlighting a double standard. However, the method might be problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether using the girlfriend's own standards to enforce a change is acceptable. If the author is applying the same standards the girlfriend set, then maybe not. However, it's still a bit of a gray area because the girlfriend might not see the two situations as the same. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they are pointing out the inconsistency in the girlfriend's standards. The answer would be B (No).\n"
