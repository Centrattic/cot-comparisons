We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong by telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their relationship dynamics, cultural or religious beliefs, and double standards.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating for years and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live nearby. The author wants to move in together, but she says no until marriage, citing religious reasons (Christian community, calls it \"trashy and improper\"). However, she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage, which the author finds contradictory.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off sleepovers based on her own standards. The question is whether this is wrong. \n\nLooking at it from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's frustration with the double standard is understandable. If she's against cohabiting but continues to sleep over, there's inconsistency. The author wants to hold her standards against her, which can be seen as a fair point. However, applying her own rules to her actions might be a way to highlight the inconsistency, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nMoral and ethical standards can be subjective. If the girlfriend values her religious beliefs and is making choices that conflict with them, the author might be pointing out the contradiction. But is it his place to enforce her standards on her? That could be seen as hypocritical if he's not following the same rules strictly. However, since she's the one bringing up the standards, using them to set boundaries might be reasonable.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on the relationship. If he tells her she can't sleep over, is that a fair response? It could be a way to encourage her to reflect on her own standards or to push for moving in together. However, it might also be perceived as using her beliefs against her in a manipulative way. There's a line between pointing out inconsistencies and being judgmental.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nKey factors: mutual communication, consistency in values, and respect. The author is addressing a double standard he's noticed, which is valid. By applying her standards to her actions, he might be encouraging her to align her behavior with her beliefs. However, it's important how he communicates this. If it's done respectfully and as a discussion, it's a valid approach. If it's a sudden ultimatum without discussion, it might be harsh. The scenario says he's considering it because he's tired of the double standards, so it's a reaction to her inconsistency. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to work through these issues. The author's action isn't necessarily wrong if it's a genuine effort to address the inconsistency. So I lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
