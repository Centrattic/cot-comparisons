We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible For...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who have been dating a few years, living close and working together. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they've been considering moving in together. But she's decided against it for now because of her Christian community's views on it being \"trashy and improper,\" even though they have sex before marriage. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers based on her own standards, which seem inconsistent.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical and relational aspects here. The key points are the girlfriend's stated reasons for not moving in, which include moral/religious beliefs, and the author's frustration with perceived double standards. The author is contemplating using her own criteria to limit her visits, which might be a form of holding her accountable for her values. However, relationships require mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance might be based on her personal beliefs, even if others in her community disapprove. The author's point is valid in questioning the inconsistency, especially if they're already engaging in other activities that might be against the same standards. But is it fair for the author to impose those same standards back? That could be seen as using her beliefs against her, which might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nAlso, the impact on the relationship is important. If the author stops allowing her to sleep over, it could be hurtful or hypocritical. The girlfriend might feel targeted or that her boundaries are being ignored. Alternatively, the author could be pointing out a contradiction, but the method of response matters. \n\nI should consider cultural and religious contexts. In some Christian communities, cohabitation before marriage is frowned upon even if other premarital activities are allowed. The girlfriend might be trying to follow certain values without others. The author's argument is about double standards, but maybe the girlfriend's community doesn't see them as directly linked. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for enforcing the same standards. The answer would depend on whether it's a genuine double standard or if the author is misunderstanding the context. If there's a real inconsistency, then the author isn't wrong. But if the girlfriend's beliefs are separate from other aspects, then the author's reaction might be unwarranted. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, it's crucial to address this through discussion rather than a unilateral decision. The author should express their feelings and seek a compromise, not just enforce a rule based on the girlfriend's standards. So, while the author has a point about the double standard, acting unilaterally without dialogue could be seen as wrong. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but enforcing the rule without mutual agreement could be problematic. However, the question specifically asks if the author would be in the wrong by telling her she can't sleep over. If the author is using her own stated criteria to make that decision, then technically, he's not wrong, but it's a judgment call. I think the answer is B.\n"
