We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves a long-term relationship where both are in the same company and live close. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, they're not in a rush to marry, but moving in together was a natural next step. However, she's decided against it because of her Christian community's views, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds her stance judgmental, especially since they're already having sex. The author is contemplating using her own standards to deny her sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects. The key points are mutual respect, consistency in values, and the impact on the relationship. The girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her beliefs, which the author finds inconsistent. The author is frustrated with the double standard\u2014she sleeps over and has sex but refuses cohabitation. The author wants to enforce the same standard she's using, which could be seen as a way to address hypocrisy.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, cohabitation and premarital sex are sensitive topics, especially in certain religious communities. The girlfriend's stance might be rooted in her upbringing or beliefs, even if the author finds it inconsistent. The author's plan to deny sleepovers using her criteria might be a form of moral policing. However, the author is also highlighting the inconsistency in her actions versus her beliefs. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong, but ethically, it's more nuanced. Relationships require negotiation and compromise. If the author's intent is to confront the inconsistency, that's one angle. But if it's punitive, it might escalate conflict. The decision to enforce a standard that the girlfriend herself has set could be seen as fair, as the author is holding her to her own stated values. However, it's important to consider if this approach could harm the relationship or lead to resentment.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but the action of enforcing a sleepover ban could be seen as using her own standards against her. The key is whether the author's action is a constructive way to address the conflict or a manipulative move. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on the intent and the impact. The author's frustration is valid, but the method might not be the healthiest approach. However, in terms of right or wrong, if the author is using the girlfriend's own standards to enforce boundaries, it's a matter of perspective. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), but with caveats about relationship dynamics.\n"
