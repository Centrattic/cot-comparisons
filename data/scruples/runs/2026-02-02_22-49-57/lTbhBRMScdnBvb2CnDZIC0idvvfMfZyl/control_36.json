I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week at the author's place. They work together and live close. The author thinks moving in together makes sense given the frequency, but she refuses until marriage because it's \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. The author points out the double standard since she's already staying over often and having sex before marriage, which he argues is also frowned upon. He's considering cutting off her sleepovers using her own reasoning.\n\nSo, the key points here are the inconsistency in her standards. She's applying different rules to different situations. If sleeping over multiple nights a week is considered improper according to her beliefs, then having frequent sleepovers and engaging in premarital sex might contradict her own values. The author is pointing out this inconsistency and using her own criteria to make a decision. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using someone's own standards against them can be seen as a valid response to hypocrisy. However, the situation is complex. The author is taking a stance based on her beliefs, which might not be fair because he's not bound by those same beliefs. But in this case, he's using her reasoning to enforce a boundary. Since she's the one who established the \"improper\" standard, the author is highlighting the contradiction. \n\nIf the author is acting in good faith and pointing out the inconsistency, then A (he's in the wrong) might not be correct. But if he's being hypocritical or using it as a way to punish her for her standards, then maybe A. However, the user's situation is that he's tired of the double standards and is using her own logic to set a boundary. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's applying her own criteria to a situation where she's not following it consistently. It's about addressing hypocrisy rather than imposing his own standards. So the author is using her reasoning to enforce a boundary, which might be fair given the inconsistency.\n"
