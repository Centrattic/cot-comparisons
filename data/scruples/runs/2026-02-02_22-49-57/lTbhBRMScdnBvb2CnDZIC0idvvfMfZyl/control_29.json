We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she said moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. \n\nSo, the situation is that they've been dating a few years, she stays over 4+ nights a week, and they work together. He thinks it's time to move in together, but she refuses until marriage. He finds her stance judgmental, especially since she's already staying over a lot and they're having sex. He's considering using her own standards against her by saying if she thinks living together is wrong, then she shouldn't be staying over either.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The key points are about double standards and respect in a relationship. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on religious values, but her actions (frequent sleepovers and sex) might conflict with those same values. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here, which could be valid. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on how he handles this.\n\nIf he's using her own standards to cut off her sleepovers, is that fair? Well, he's not forcing her to do anything; he's holding her to the standards she herself has set. If she doesn't want to live together before marriage because it's improper, then logically, frequent sleepovers and having sex also premarital, which some Christian communities might frown upon. So, the author is highlighting a contradiction in her stance.\n\nBut is it the author's place to enforce her beliefs on her? The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to make a point by limiting her sleepovers based on her own criteria, is that fair? It could be seen as using her beliefs against her, which might not be constructive. However, if she's the one bringing up religious standards, then he's just applying them consistently. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author mentions they've been talking about moving in together. If her stance is non-negotiable, maybe he needs to consider if their values align. But if he's retaliating by cutting off sleepovers, that could be a form of punishment, which might not be healthy. However, if he's not in a position to move in together and she's the one refusing, then perhaps he's not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"double standards\" is important. If she's applying her religious beliefs to some aspects but not others, he's right to question that. But is it his responsibility to enforce her beliefs? That could be where he might be in the wrong. It's about mutual respect; if he doesn't agree with her stance, he might need to decide whether to let it go or address it in a healthy way.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is pointing out a valid inconsistency in her beliefs versus her actions. However, using her own standards to cut off sleepovers could be seen as manipulative or using her beliefs against her, which might not be the best approach. But if he's not forcing her to stay over and is just holding her to her own standards, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (No), because the author is highlighting a double standard rather than acting out of malice.\n"
