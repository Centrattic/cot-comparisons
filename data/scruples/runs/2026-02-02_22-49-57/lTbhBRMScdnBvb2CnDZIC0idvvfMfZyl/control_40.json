We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their differing views on cohabitation and Christian values.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which is a lot. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but she refuses because of her beliefs. She's from a Christian community where moving in before marriage is frowned upon as \"trashy and improper.\" However, she's been sleeping over frequently and having sex, which the author points out as a double standard.\n\nThe author is frustrated and wants to reciprocate by cutting off the sleepovers based on her own criteria. The key here is whether the author is justified in using her standards against her. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in her stance. If she's against cohabitation but engages in it, then the author using her reasoning to stop the sleepovers could be valid. But is it fair? \n\nLegally and ethically, relationships are about mutual respect and communication. The author is reacting to hypocrisy but could be seen as using her own standards against her, which might not be the healthiest approach. However, the girlfriend's actions do contradict her beliefs. The author's decision to set boundaries based on her own stated values isn't necessarily wrong, but it's a complicated dynamic.\n\nConsidering the double standards and the author's frustration, it's a gray area. But since the girlfriend's actions don't align with her beliefs, the author isn't entirely in the wrong here. The answer might be B, but there are nuances.\n"
