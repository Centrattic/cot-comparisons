      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong by considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore based on her own criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, they work together and live close. They were considering moving in together, but she's decided against it until marriage due to her Christian community's views. The author finds this judgmental, especially since she's already sleeping over and having sex. Now, he's thinking of using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nSo, the key points are: she has a moral stance against cohabitation before marriage, but is currently engaging in similar behavior (sleepovers and sex). The author is using her reasoning to justify cutting off the sleepovers, which could be seen as hypocritical on her part, but is the author in the wrong for doing that?\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, communication and mutual respect are important. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in her stance. However, by deciding unilaterally to stop the sleepovers based on her own criteria, he might be using her standards against her, which could be seen as a form of hypocrisy or a way to enforce his own views. \n\nBut maybe the author is just highlighting the contradiction. If she's okay with frequent sleepovers and sex but not moving in together, there's a discrepancy. The author's action is a response to her double standards. However, is it right to enforce that? Relationships should be based on mutual agreement. If she's set boundaries about moving in, but he's enforcing a boundary about sleepovers, that could create conflict. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning might be a bit of a \"you're being inconsistent here\" argument, which is valid, but if he's doing it to manipulate the situation, that's another issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's addressing her double standards logically, maybe not. But if he's using it to punish or pressure her, then yes. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his approach is justified. If he's pointing out her inconsistency and setting a boundary based on her own reasoning, it's a bit of a gray area. However, relationships require compromise. Maybe he's using her standards to control the situation, which could be wrong. Alternatively, he's standing up for his feelings regarding hypocrisy.\n\nIn Christian teachings, cohabitation before marriage is often discouraged, but the specifics can vary. The girlfriend's position is clear, but the author is now applying her standards to her actions. It's a bit of a paradox. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong if he's using her reasoning to enforce a boundary without mutual discussion, especially if it's more about his frustration with her double standards than actually respecting her beliefs. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is indeed being inconsistent, the author's stance might be reasonable. But since the situation is about their relationship dynamics, the key is mutual respect. If the author acts unilaterally without discussing it, that could be wrong. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer might be A (Yes), because he's enforcing a boundary based on her own criteria in a way that could be seen as hypocritical or manipulative, especially if it's to counter her double standards. But the answer could also be B if it's seen as a justified response to her inconsistency. I think it's a bit of both, but leaning towards A since using her standards against her might not be the right approach. However, maybe the answer is B because he's addressing hypocrisy. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer here is A because relationships require mutual agreement and enforcing such a boundary without discussion could be wrong. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
