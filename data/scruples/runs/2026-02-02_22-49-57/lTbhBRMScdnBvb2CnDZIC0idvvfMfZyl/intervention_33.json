We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong after deciding their girlfriend can't sleep over anymore. They've been dating for a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they work together. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until marriage because of her Christian beliefs, considering it improper. The author is upset because she's been sleeping over and having sex before marriage but now objects to moving in together. The user thinks the author is not wrong and wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her religious beliefs, which she applies inconsistently. She's already living with the author in a way (sleeping over multiple nights a week), which might be seen as similar to cohabitation. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy, which is a valid point. However, changing the rules mid-relationship can be problematic. The author's response is to stop allowing sleepovers, which could be seen as using her own standards against her. But it's also about addressing the inconsistency.\n\nThe key points are: mutual expectations, the girlfriend's shift in stance, and the author's response. The author's action is a reaction to the girlfriend's double standards. While the author is not wrong to call out hypocrisy, using her reasoning to enforce a change might not be fair. However, if the girlfriend is comfortable with some behaviors but not others, the author can set boundaries. It's a complex situation where both parties need to communicate and agree on what's acceptable. The author isn't necessarily wrong for addressing the inconsistency, but their method might be harsh. But given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not wrong) because the author is reacting to the girlfriend's conflicting standards.\n"
