      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they work at the same company. They're considering moving in together, but she's against it until marriage because she's from a Christian community that frowns on cohabitation. However, she's been sleeping over often and having sex before marriage.\n\nFirst, the author is pointing out the hypocrisy here. The girlfriend uses religious reasons to avoid moving in together, but her current behavior (sleeping over multiple nights a week) already goes against those same standards. The author feels this is a double standard and wants to call her out on it by stopping the sleepovers.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider are consent, mutual respect, and the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend initially agreed to sleep over, so if the author suddenly stops it without discussion, that might be abrupt. But the author is reacting to her double standards. However, using her own criteria to justify changing the arrangement could be seen as a fair response. \n\nAlso, communication is important. If the author hasn't discussed this with her yet, maybe they should. But the scenario says they've talked about moving in and she's against it. The author's action is a response to her inconsistency. It's a conflict between her religious beliefs and her current actions. The author is trying to bring that inconsistency to light.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing something inherently illegal or harmful. It's more about how they handle the situation. The girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, but she's not adhering to them herself. The author is challenging that. So the author isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach could be better. Maybe instead of an ultimatum, discussing the issues would be better. But given the options, the answer would be B (No) because the author is addressing a double standard, not acting out of malice.\n"
