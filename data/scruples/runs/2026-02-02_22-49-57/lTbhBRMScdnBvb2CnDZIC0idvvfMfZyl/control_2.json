We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the question) is in the wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their girlfriend sleeping over four or more nights a week, which the author sees as inconsistent with her stance against moving in together before marriage. The girlfriend cites religious reasons (Christian community) for not wanting to cohabit, but the author argues that her current behavior contradicts her beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is in a Christian community that frowns upon cohabitation before marriage. She's against moving in together but continues to sleep over frequently. The author feels this is a double standard and is considering using her own standards to cut off the sleepovers. \n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and communication. The couple has been talking about moving in together, and the girlfriend has made her position clear. The author is frustrated with what they perceive as hypocrisy. However, the author is now threatening to enforce a similar standard, which could be seen as hypocritical as well. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's behavior might not align with her stated beliefs, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is justified in retaliating. Relationships require negotiation and compromise. If the author is using her own criteria to justify cutting her off, that could be seen as using her standards against her, which might not be fair. Also, the author's frustration is valid, but the solution of cutting off sleepovers might not address the underlying issue. \n\nThe author could be trying to highlight the inconsistency, but doing so by enforcing a rule based on the girlfriend's beliefs might be a form of manipulation. It's possible that the author is trying to correct the girlfriend's behavior by mirroring the judgment she applies. However, this approach could damage trust and communication. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be within their rights to adjust their behavior if they're uncomfortable with the girlfriend's stance, but enforcing a strict cutoff without addressing the communication gap could be problematic. The right answer here might hinge on whether the author's action is a fair response or if it's using the girlfriend's own beliefs against her, which could be seen as manipulative. So, the author might be in the wrong because they're not addressing the issue through dialogue but instead using the girlfriend's rules to limit her, potentially causing more conflict.\n"
