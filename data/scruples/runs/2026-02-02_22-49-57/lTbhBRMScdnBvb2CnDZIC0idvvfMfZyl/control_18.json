We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the question) is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves cultural or religious values from a Christian community where moving in together before marriage is frowned upon. The girlfriend sleeps over four or more nights a week, which the author sees as a step toward moving in together. She's against moving in together until married, citing it's improper. The author is frustrated by what he perceives as a double standard because they are already spending a lot of time together and having sex, which he points out is also considered improper. He wants to use her own standards to justify cutting off the sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The author is trying to hold the girlfriend to the same standards she's applying. But is it fair for him to impose his interpretation of her values back on her? The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her beliefs, which she's vocal about. She's clear that moving in together is against her values. However, the author is pointing out that her current behavior (sleeping over frequently and having sex) might also be against those same values. That's a valid point, but does that mean the author is justified in retaliating by cutting off sleepovers?\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author and girlfriend have been discussing this, but there's a conflict in values. The author is frustrated by the inconsistency he sees, but enforcing his own standards through a sudden change in behavior (no more sleepovers) without resolving the underlying issue might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to resentment or more conflict.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. It's about personal ethics and relationship dynamics. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using her own standards to make a decision. The key is whether his action is a fair response. If the girlfriend believes that sleeping over and having sex is improper before marriage, but continues to do so, the author is pointing out the inconsistency. However, by then using that inconsistency to cut off sleepovers, he's essentially holding her to the same standards she's advocating. But is that fair?\n\nAlternatively, the author could be trying to apply her values to pressure her into moving in together, which might not be the right approach. Or he might be using her own words against her to end the sleepovers, which could be seen as hypocritical if he's okay with the current arrangement but now wants to change it based on her standards.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is using her values to enforce a decision that he himself is not fully committed to (since he was open to moving in together), that could be hypocritical. However, if he's genuinely trying to hold her to her own values, then it's a matter of whether it's appropriate to do so in a relationship. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's values, and if one party is not adhering to their own professed values, the other might have reason to bring it up. But cutting off sleepovers as a form of punishment for inconsistency might not be the best way to handle it.\n\nIn summary, the author is pointing out a double standard and reacting by enforcing the same standards he feels she's neglecting. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his action is a fair response to her inconsistency. Since relationships need compromise and open communication, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address the inconsistency, but using her own standards against her might not be the most constructive approach. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is about the rightness of his action, maybe the author isn't wrong because he's responding to her stated values, but the way he's applying them could be problematic. But the user wants a yes or no answer. Considering the situation, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's using her values to enforce a decision that might not resolve the underlying issue and could be seen as manipulative. Alternatively, if he's consistent in applying her standards, then B (not in the wrong). The key is whether his action is a fair response. Since he's using her own words against her, perhaps the answer is B. But I need to make sure.\n"
