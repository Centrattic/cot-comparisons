We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend sleeps over multiple nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together until marriage. The author is upset because she's holding a standard that he feels is double standards, especially since they've already been having sex before marriage. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own standards against her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her Christian community's values, which she believes moving in together is \"trashy and improper.\" However, she already sleeps over frequently, which the author points out as a contradiction. The author is frustrated and wants to enforce her standards by cutting off the sleepovers.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics and communication aspects. The author is responding to her double standards by applying her own rules. But is it fair for him to take that approach? Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend has set boundaries about moving in together, but her actions (sleeping over often) don't align with that, the author might be pointing out inconsistencies. However, reacting by cutting off sleepovers could be seen as punitive or using her own standards against her. \n\nOn one hand, the author is highlighting hypocrisy. On the other, enforcing her moral standards on her might not be the best approach. It could lead to resentment or escalate conflicts. The key is whether the author's action is justified. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with cohabitation before marriage, the author might need to address the inconsistency through discussion rather than abruptly changing the rules. \n\nAnother angle: The author is trying to make the girlfriend adhere to the same standards she expects from him. But relationships require compromise. The author's action might be seen as taking her words out of context. Also, the girlfriend's initial decision to sleep over frequently might have been a mutual agreement, so changing those terms unilaterally could be unfair.\n\nIn terms of respect, the author's approach might be seen as using her own standards against her, which could be manipulative. Instead of enforcing her rules, a better approach would be to discuss the inconsistencies and find a middle ground. So, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing this through dialogue and instead taking a confrontational stance. However, the girlfriend's double standards are a valid point, but the method of response is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's using her standards punitively rather than addressing the issue through open communication. Alternatively, B (No) if he's merely pointing out hypocrisy. But in relationship dynamics, such punitive actions can be harmful. The author's action is taking her words to a logical end, but in a way that could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
