We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together before marriage but still sleeps over frequently. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been dating a few years, she's over 4+ nights a week. He thinks moving in together makes sense, but she refuses until marriage because of her Christian community's views. He's upset about the double standards and wants to cut off the sleepovers based on her own criteria.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Ethically, it's about mutual respect and communication. The girl is following her beliefs but still engaging in behavior (sleeping over, having sex) that she claims is improper. The author is pointing out what he sees as a contradiction. But using her own arguments against her might be a form of manipulation or hypocrisy, but maybe not wrong since he's reacting to her stated beliefs.\n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. If the girl is okay with the sleepovers but not moving in together, maybe the author is overstepping by enforcing her rules. He could be projecting his frustration onto her standards. Also, is it fair for him to use her arguments to justify his actions? That might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nBut from another angle, he's trying to address the inconsistency. If she's against cohabitation before marriage, then she should also avoid situations that lead to premarital intimacy. By sleeping over, she's contradicting her own values. So the author is trying to hold her to her own standards. But does that make him right? Maybe not necessarily. The problem is the hypocrisy, but the solution of cutting off sleepovers could be punitive rather than addressing the core issue through dialogue.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for using her standards against her. Relationships need open communication and mutual respect. Instead of enforcing her rules, maybe he should discuss why there's a discrepancy and see if they can find a compromise. By taking away her sleepovers based on her beliefs, he's imposing his will, which might not be right. Especially since she's the one who set the standards. So, the author's action could be seen as hypocritical if he's not following her rules from the start. But if he's just pointing out the inconsistency, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's using her standards to control the situation instead of addressing the underlying issues through mutual understanding. Relationships require both parties to communicate openly and adjust. Cutting off sleepovers unilaterally could be seen as a power move rather than a respectful solution.\n"
