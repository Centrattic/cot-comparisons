We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple in a long-term relationship where she's been sleeping over a lot, but they're not moving in together because of her religious beliefs. The author wants to cut off her sleepovers because she's being judgmental about moving in before marriage, even though they're already having sex.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's stance is based on her Christian community's values, which frown on cohabitation before marriage. The author is frustrated because she's already staying over frequently, which could be seen as inconsistent with her values. The author is considering using her own criteria to stop allowing sleepovers, which seems like a form of pointing out hypocrisy.\n\nBut is the author justified? The girlfriend's argument is about moving in together versus individual sleepovers. Cohabitation is often considered different from just visiting a partner's home. Even if they sleep over often, it's not the same as sharing a residence. The author's move to stop sleepovers would be enforcing her standards, but the girlfriend might argue that occasional visits are different. \n\nAlso, the author is accused of double standards by the girlfriend. The author is reacting to the girlfriend's stance, but maybe the issue is that the girlfriend's rules are inconsistent (sleeping over a lot but not moving in). However, the author's response of cutting off sleepovers might be too extreme. The girlfriend is the one who set the boundary about moving in, not about individual visits. So, the author might be overstepping by applying that rule to sleepovers.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the girlfriend's own criteria against her, which could be seen as manipulative. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the author is frustrated, maybe they need to discuss it together rather than unilaterally changing the rules. The author's action could be seen as punishing her for her beliefs, which might not be fair. \n\nBut the author is also pointing out hypocrisy. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation but is already staying over multiple nights, there's inconsistency. However, the author could have had a conversation about this instead of cutting her off. The key here is whether the sleepovers count as cohabitation. If they're separate visits and not a shared residence, then the girlfriend's objection to moving in might not apply. The author's response might be a reaction to feeling disrespected, but it's important to consider the girlfriend's perspective and their relationship dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of cutting off sleepovers based on the girlfriend's criteria might not be justified. The girlfriend's rules are about moving in together, not about individual visits. The author could be misapplying the standards, leading to conflict. The right approach would be to discuss the inconsistency and find a compromise rather than using the criteria as a weapon. So, the author is in the wrong (A) because they're enforcing a rule that the girlfriend didn't set, leading to unfair treatment.\n"
