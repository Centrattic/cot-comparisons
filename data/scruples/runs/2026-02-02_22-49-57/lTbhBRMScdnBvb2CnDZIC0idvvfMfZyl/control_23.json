We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend is sleeping over multiple nights a week but doesn't want to move in together before marriage. The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over because of her own double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend is against moving in together before marriage due to her Christian community's views, yet she's already sleeping over a lot. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here. The author is thinking of cutting off the sleepovers based on her own standards.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is responding to the girlfriend's standards with a \"do as I say, not as I do\" approach. But does that justify the author's action? The girlfriend's stance might be hypocritical, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is right to retaliate. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author is using her own rules against her, it could be seen as using hypocrisy to justify a controlling action. The author should address the inconsistency through discussion rather than punishment. The key here is whether the author's response is fair. By enforcing her standards, the author is being judgmental too, which might not be right. The answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author is acting out of judgment instead of resolving the issue through dialogue. But maybe B (No) if the author is standing up for their own values. However, since the author is using the girlfriend's own rules against her in a way that's controlling, A seems more likely.\n"
