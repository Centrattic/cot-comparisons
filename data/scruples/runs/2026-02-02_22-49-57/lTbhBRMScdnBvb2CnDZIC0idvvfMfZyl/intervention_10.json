We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the girlfriend sleeps over frequently, and there's a disagreement about moving in together. She cites her Christian beliefs as a reason to wait until marriage, but the author is pointing out the inconsistency since they already have a sexual relationship and she's staying over multiple nights a week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The girlfriend's stance is based on religious beliefs, which are important to her. However, the author is highlighting a double standard\u2014she's following some parts of her beliefs (not moving in together) but not others (sleeping over and having sex). The author's response would be to enforce her own standards, which the author finds hypocritical.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is valid. But is it right to punish her by ending the sleepovers? The author is using her own criteria against her, which might be a form of holding her accountable. However, it's also important to consider whether this action is fair or if it's a way to exert control. The author could be in the right if they're addressing hypocrisy, but if it's a manipulative tactic, maybe not.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The fact that they've discussed this before suggests that the author is trying to address the issue. The girlfriend's refusal to move in despite her current behavior might be the root of the problem. The author's response is a way to highlight that inconsistency, which could be justified.\n\nBut is it wrong to impose one's standards? The author is using the same moral framework the girlfriend presented. If the girlfriend is using her beliefs to set boundaries, the author is consistent in applying those same boundaries. That seems fair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
