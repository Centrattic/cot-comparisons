      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe user and their girlfriend have been dating for a few years. She sleeps over at his place 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. They're not in a rush to get married, but he thinks moving in together makes sense. She says she doesn't want to move in together until they're married because it's \"trashy and improper\" in her Christian community. The author finds this judgmental, especially since she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore because, according to her standards, it's also improper.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about consistency in moral standards. The girlfriend is applying a standard that she doesn't follow herself. She's against cohabitation before marriage (moving in together), but she's already sleeping over multiple nights a week. The author is pointing out her double standard. If her religion or community frowns upon pre-marital cohabitation, then sleeping over multiple times a week and having sex would also fall under that, right? So the author is essentially calling her out on the inconsistency.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for responding with a double standard of his own. If he tells her she can't sleep over anymore because that's \"trashy and improper\" according to her own criteria, is that fair or is he overstepping?\n\nOn one hand, he's pointing out her inconsistency, which is a valid point. She's using her religious beliefs to argue against moving in together but isn't considering her current behavior. The author is challenging her to live up to her own standards. That seems fair. However, if he's using her argument against her in a way that's manipulative or punitive, that could be a problem. But in this context, he's stating the logical conclusion of her argument. If she can't accept her own standards, then the author is just applying the same logic she uses to his behavior.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. They've talked about moving in together, so maybe the author should have addressed the double standard earlier. However, the user is now considering a sudden change in their arrangement, which could be disruptive to their relationship. The key here is whether the author is being hypocritical. The user isn't moving in together; he's just stopping her from sleeping over. But according to her standards, that's also pre-marital cohabitation. So if she's against it, then the author is just enforcing her own standards. But is the author allowed to do that? Or is it more appropriate to address the inconsistency through discussion rather than punishment?\n\nAnother angle: the author is using her argument against her, which is a form of logical consistency. However, relationships require compromise. If the author is willing to sleep over but not live together, maybe there's a middle ground. But according to her standards, both are the same. The author's response is to stop the sleeping overs, which might be a way to force her to reconsider her stance. But is that fair? Or is he using guilt or manipulation?\n\nI think the key here is that the author is pointing out the inconsistency in her argument. If her religion says that pre-marital cohabitation is wrong, then sleeping over multiple nights is also cohabitation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for applying her own logic to their current situation. However, the way he does it matters. If he's doing it to pressure her into changing her stance, that's one thing. If he's doing it because he's tired of her double standards, then it's more about holding her accountable. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether his actions are a justified response to her inconsistency.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, if the author is simply applying the same standards she uses, he's not being hypocritical. He's just showing that her standards aren't being followed. However, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the author is using this as a punishment, that could be problematic. But the scenario suggests he's responding to her argument logically. So the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
