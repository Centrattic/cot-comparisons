She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards. So, the situation is that they've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together, live close. He thinks it's time to move in together, but she doesn't want to because of Christian values, saying it's improper until marriage. He's pointing out the double standard because they're already having sex and she's often at his place. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral and ethical implications. The key points here are the double standards and mutual respect. She's against moving in together but accepts sleeping over, which is similar to living together in terms of intimacy and time spent together. The author is upset because her standards seem inconsistent. He's using her own arguments against her, which could be seen as a fair point, but maybe there's more nuance. \n\nIn relationships, communication is important. The author might feel that her stance is hypocritical, and he's reacting by enforcing her rules, which might not be the healthiest approach. However, if he's pointing out the inconsistency, maybe he's justified in questioning her standards. \n\nAlso, the concept of \"trashy\" and \"improper\" is subjective and based on her religious beliefs. The author might be challenging her judgment by applying the same standard to their current situation. But is it right for him to retaliate by cutting off sleepovers using her own reasoning? That could be seen as holding her to a standard she's not willing to apply to herself, which might not be fair. \n\nAnother angle is that the author might be using her own words against her to force a change, which could be manipulative. Alternatively, if she's being hypocritical, he's pointing out the inconsistency. However, relationships require mutual respect and negotiation. If he's taking a stance based on her beliefs, but she's not consistent, he might be in a position where he needs to set boundaries, but cutting off sleepovers abruptly might not be the best approach.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If he's pointing out her double standards by enforcing her own rules, it's a bit of a paradox. But if he's doing it to push her towards moving in together, maybe he's overstepping. However, if he's genuinely upset by her inconsistency, he might have a valid reason. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key is whether his action is justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's challenging her inconsistency, but some might argue that using her own standards against her is unfair. However, considering the situation, it's more about mutual respect and communication rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
