We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because her own beliefs about moving in together before marriage are \"trashy and improper.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. He thinks moving in together makes sense, but she refuses because of her Christian community's views. However, she's already sleeping over a lot and having sex. The author is frustrated with her double standards and wants to apply her own standards to her actions.\n\nThe key points here are double standards. She's against moving in together but continues to sleep over frequently. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. If she's okay with staying over multiple nights but not moving in, that's a contradiction. Her standards might be subjective, but the author is responding to her own criteria. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's using her own standards to set boundaries, then he's not wrong. However, using her beliefs as a reason to cut her off could be seen as manipulative. The question is whether he's applying her rules fairly. If he's pointing out the hypocrisy, maybe he's justified. But using her standards against her in a punitive way might be problematic. \n\nAlso, communication is key here. The author might be reacting to frustration, but cutting her off abruptly could be harsh. The right approach might be discussing boundaries, not just enforcing them. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is enforcing the same standards she uses against her actions, then technically he's pointing out the inconsistency, which isn't wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
