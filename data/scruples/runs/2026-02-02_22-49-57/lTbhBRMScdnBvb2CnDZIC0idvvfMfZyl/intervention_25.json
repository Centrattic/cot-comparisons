      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating a few years, and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together, live close, and aren't rushing into marriage. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until they're married because it's \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. The author feels this is a double standard since she's already sleeping over a lot and they're having sex pre-marriage. He's considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend sets a boundary about not moving in together until marriage, but she's already sleeping over frequently. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. The key question is whether enforcing the same standard (staying away to avoid being \"trashy\") is fair or not.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might feel that the girlfriend's standards are hypocritical, so he's trying to highlight that by reciprocating. However, the girlfriend's stance is based on her community's values, even if her actions don't align with them. The author is using her own values against her, which could be seen as a form of manipulation. On the other hand, he's pointing out the inconsistency in her behavior. \n\nIs it fair for the author to enforce her standards? If he's already accepting her sleeping over, even though it's against her standards, then applying the same logic to restrict her visits might be a way to call out the double standard. But does that make him in the wrong? If he's being hypocritical by not moving in together despite her sleeping over, but he's not enforcing that, maybe he's in the right. However, by using her own standards to deny her sleepovers, he's applying a rule she believes in. But she's already violating that rule by sleeping over. So it's a bit of a paradox.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are important. The author is frustrated and trying to make her see the inconsistency. However, using her values against her could be seen as a power move rather than a constructive discussion. It might not resolve the underlying issue but create more conflict. The author's approach might be seen as fair if he's addressing hypocrisy, but it could also be seen as unfair if he's using her beliefs to control her actions. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might depend on how the author presents his argument. If he's being confrontational, that's not ideal. But if he's trying to have an honest conversation about the inconsistencies, he might be justified. However, enforcing a move that would limit her presence could be seen as taking a stand on her own beliefs, which could be seen as fair. But maybe the problem is that he's applying her standards to his own actions, which he wasn't doing before. \n\nHmm. The core issue is the double standard. The author is pointing out that she's not following her own standards, so he's applying the same standard to her. So by her own standards, she shouldn't be sleeping over, so he's enforcing that. That seems logical. But is it fair for him to take that action without discussing it? Maybe not, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's using her own reasoning against her, then technically he's not in the wrong for pointing out the hypocrisy. However, relationships require mutual agreement, and if she's the one enforcing the standards, he's not necessarily in the wrong to challenge them. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because he's addressing the inconsistency in her behavior by applying her own standards. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe the problem is that he's being hypocritical by not moving in together but allowing her to sleep over. Wait, they aren't moving in yet. The girlfriend is against moving in until marriage, but sleeping over is a step towards that. The author is saying that since she's already sleeping over a lot, he's not sure why she's against moving in together. So he's using her own standards (moving in is trashy) to stop her from sleeping over, which she's already doing. Therefore, his action is a way to make her see the inconsistency. \n\nIn that case, he's using her own logic to challenge her, which is fair game in a discussion. However, actually enforcing a sleepover ban might be a harsh move. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her to do anything beyond what she's already doing, but pointing out the inconsistency, I think he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
