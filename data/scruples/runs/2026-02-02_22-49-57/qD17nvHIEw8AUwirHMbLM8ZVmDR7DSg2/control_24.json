We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has a bulimia problem and has been taking the author's food, sometimes replacing it with different products. The author confronted the roommate, who then broke down crying. The author feels justified because they cook for themselves and can't afford to eat out, so they don't want someone else eating their food. They argue that it's not about the money but about respecting boundaries.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. The roommate has a mental health issue, which complicates things. Bulimia is a serious condition that can affect self-control. The author's main issue is about personal property and boundaries. On one hand, the author has a right to their food and belongings. On the other hand, the roommate is struggling with an illness and might not have full control over their actions. \n\nThe author did confront the roommate, which is understandable. However, the way they responded might have been harsh. They told the roommate it's not their problem and suggested she should buy her own food. This could come off as dismissive of the roommate's health issue. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which means she's seeking help. \n\nThe author's argument is that the roommate should control herself, comparing it to not taking food from a grocery store or someone's table. But in this case, the roommate isn't in a public place; she's in her own home, sharing a living space. The author is also paying for everything, so it's their property. However, the roommate might not have the same privilege of eating out as the author does since she's on parents' support.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between personal responsibility and mental health. The author is not wrong for setting boundaries, but their approach might have been too harsh without considering the roommate's health. The roommate might need empathy and support, but the author has a right to their property. However, the author could have approached the situation with more compassion, acknowledging the roommate's struggle while still enforcing the boundary. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a right to their belongings, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong\" as per the AITA framework. Since the author's actions were about protecting their own property and setting clear boundaries, and the roommate's actions are a result of a mental health issue, the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole. But there's a nuance here where the response could be seen as dismissive. However, given that the author tried to be understanding but still enforced their boundaries, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
