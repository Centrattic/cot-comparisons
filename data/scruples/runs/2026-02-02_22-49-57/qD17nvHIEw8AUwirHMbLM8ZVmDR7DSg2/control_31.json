We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who asked this question is in the wrong. The situation is about their roommate being bulimic and taking their food. The user is upset because they cook a lot and are on a budget, and they found their food missing or replaced. They confronted the roommate, who admitted to taking the food due to her bulimia. The user told the roommate to buy her own food, and now they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's situation. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can be really hard to control, especially without treatment. The roommate is on a waitlist for help, so she's not just being careless. She's struggling with a mental health issue. The user's roommate is paying her share, cleaning, etc., so she's not being negligent in other areas. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is cooking a lot and is supporting themselves. Their food is their property, and having someone take it without permission feels violated. They're within their rights to expect others to respect their belongings. However, the user's response was to confront the roommate, which led to emotional distress. The user also mentioned that the roommate replaces the food, but the user is still upset about their property being taken. \n\nThe user's argument is that the roommate should control herself, similar to how they control themselves when they don't eat a whole box of cookies. But bulimia is a compulsion, not just a lack of willpower. It's not that simple to just \"stop.\" The user's comment about not taking from grocery stores or restaurants might be a bit hypocritical, but in those cases, the food isn't owned by others in the same way as shared living spaces. \n\nThe question is whether the user overstepped. The user did confront the roommate, which is reasonable because they were upset. However, the way they responded\u2014telling the roommate to buy her own food and implying it's her problem\u2014might not be the best approach, especially considering the roommate's mental health. The user might not be the asshole because they have a right to their belongings, but they could have handled it more sensitively. Alternatively, maybe the roommate should have found another solution instead of taking the food. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the user is in a difficult position. They're not being cruel, just asserting their boundaries. The roommate's actions are problematic, but the user isn't wrong for standing up for themselves. The answer might be B, the user isn't the asshole. However, some might argue the user should have offered support instead of just telling her to control herself. But the user's main point is about ownership and control, which is valid. So probably B is the right choice here.\n"
