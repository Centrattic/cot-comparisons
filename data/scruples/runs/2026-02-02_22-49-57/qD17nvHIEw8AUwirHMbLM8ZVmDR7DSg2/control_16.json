We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has a bulimia problem and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with different items. The author confronted her, which led to the roommate crying and them not speaking since. The author feels they're not in the wrong because they think the roommate should control herself, even with her disorder.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. The roommate has an eating disorder, which is a mental health issue. People with bulimia might engage in binge-purge cycles, and taking food from others could be part of that. However, the author is also dealing with their own situation, cooking on a budget and not wanting others to take their food without permission.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The roommate's health issue, 2) The author's right to their belongings, and 3) How the confrontation was handled. \n\nFrom the author's side, they have a right to their food. It's reasonable to feel upset about someone taking things without asking. They approached the roommate directly when they noticed the issue, which is a valid step. But the way they handled it might be the problem. Telling the roommate that it's not their problem and suggesting she buy her own food (since her parents support her) could be seen as dismissive of her mental health struggle.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a disorder that's affecting her behavior. Even though she replaces the food, the act of taking it without consent is still an issue. The author's frustration is understandable, but they might not have considered the roommate's mental health challenges in their response. The author might have needed to approach the situation with more empathy, perhaps suggesting solutions like helping her find resources or setting clear boundaries without being confrontational.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong in their approach. The answer likely hinges on balancing respect for mental health with personal boundaries. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, but their method might have lacked empathy, which could have made the situation worse. However, since the roommate was already on a waitlist for treatment, maybe the author's frustration is justified to some extent.\n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but since the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no), I need to pick. The author isn't necessarily wrong for standing up for their food, but perhaps the way they did it was harsh. However, given that the roommate has a mental health issue, the author could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Considering the roommate's health, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to their property, but the way they expressed it could be seen as insensitive. However, the core issue is the unauthorized taking of property, which is a boundary violation regardless of mental health. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
