We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia who takes the writer's food, and the writer confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The roommate is bulimic and takes the writer's food, replacing it with different products. The writer confronts her, leading to an emotional response. The writer thinks it's unreasonable to not control herself and that others can control impulses in public, so why can't she here.\n\nHmm. The key points are the writer's right to privacy and property versus the roommate's mental health issue. The roommate is struggling with an eating disorder, which isn't her fault. However, the writer is being financially responsible, cooking to save money, and feels violated when her food is taken without permission.\n\nThe writer's response was to tell the roommate to buy her own food since her parents support her. But does that ignore the roommate's mental health? The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so maybe she's actively seeking help but can't get it right now. The writer might not realize how difficult it is for someone with an eating disorder to control their impulses, even if they intellectually know it's wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer has a right to her own food and property. It's not okay for someone to take things without asking, regardless of their issues. The writer's frustration is valid because it's their home and their resources. They're being respectful by trying to be nice after the confrontation, but the initial confrontation was necessary to set boundaries.\n\nBut maybe the writer could have handled it more compassionately. Instead of making it about her parents supporting her, maybe she could have discussed practical solutions, like setting up a communal area and a private area for food. Also, the writer might not fully grasp the severity of bulimia, which is a serious mental health condition that can be hard to manage without treatment.\n\nHowever, the writer isn't wrong to expect basic respect for her belongings. People with eating disorders often struggle with control, but that doesn't excuse taking others' property. The writer's main issue is the unauthorized use of her resources, which is a legitimate concern. She's also in a shared living situation, so there's a balance between personal responsibility and respecting others' needs.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person crossed a line. The writer didn't attack the roommate's condition but set a boundary. The roommate's actions are the main issue here. The writer's response, while perhaps harsh, is about protecting her own interests. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, even if the roommate is struggling.\n"
