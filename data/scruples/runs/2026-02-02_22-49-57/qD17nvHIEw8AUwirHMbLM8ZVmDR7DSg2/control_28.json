We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. The situation involves the roommate taking the author's food without permission.\n\nFirst, the roommate has bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. The author discovered that the roommate was taking their food, replacing it with different products, and this led to a confrontation. The roommate admitted to the issue and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author expressed frustration, pointing out that the roommate should control herself and that taking others' property isn't acceptable, even if she's struggling with the disorder.\n\nThe key points here are the roommate's mental health condition and the author's response. The author's main concern is about personal property and boundaries. They feel that regardless of the roommate's condition, she should be able to control herself in this context. However, the roommate is clearly in distress and has a mental health issue that affects her behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the author is right to set boundaries. It's not acceptable to take someone else's belongings, even with a disorder. People with bulimia often struggle with control over eating and may engage in bingeing behaviors, but that doesn't excuse taking others' food. The author is within their rights to expect their roommate to refrain from stealing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach was confrontational and might have been harsh, especially considering the roommate's mental health. The author could have handled the situation with more empathy, perhaps suggesting solutions like offering to let the roommate buy food with a shared budget or discussing ways to monitor food without confrontation. The breakdown of the roommate and the subsequent silence indicate that the confrontation hurt her deeply, which might have been avoidable with a more compassionate approach.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of asking someone to control their behavior, especially when it involves stealing, isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in how it was communicated, but the author's stance on the issue isn't necessarily wrong. The roommate's actions are inconsiderate and harmful, and the author is justified in advocating for their own space and property.\n\nSo, while the author could have handled the situation more sensitively, they aren't in the wrong for addressing the issue. The answer would be B (No), but there's a nuance in how the situation is handled that could be improved.\n"
