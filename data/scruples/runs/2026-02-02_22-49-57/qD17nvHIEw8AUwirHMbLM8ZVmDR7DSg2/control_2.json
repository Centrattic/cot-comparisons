We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two roommates where one is bulimic and taking food from the other's storage without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 20-year-old female living with another roommate who is also 20. The roommate has a bulimia problem and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, leading to an emotional breakdown. The author feels justified in asking her to control herself, especially since the roommate is supported by her parents and can buy her own food. The main issue is about ownership of shared space and boundaries.\n\nThe author's argument is that taking someone else's food without permission is wrong, regardless of the reason. The roommate's defense is her mental health condition, which the author acknowledges but doesn't excuse the behavior. The author also mentions that the roommate replaces the items, but the act of taking them is still a problem.\n\nNow, considering typical social norms and roommate responsibilities. Roommates usually share common areas and sometimes shared food, but individual items stored in personal spaces (like specific cabinets or fridges) are considered private. If the author's food was in her designated space, the roommate's actions would be a breach of trust and privacy. Even if the roommate is struggling with an eating disorder, it doesn't justify taking someone else's property without consent.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as harsh. Confronting someone about a sensitive mental health issue without empathy could exacerbate the problem. The roommate might feel isolated or not supported. The author did apologize for being mad and is trying to be nice, but the initial confrontation might have been abrupt.\n\nThe roommate's situation is complex. Bulimia is a serious illness that can impair self-control. The author is asking for restraint that the roommate might struggle to maintain, especially if she's on a waitlist for treatment. The author's stance that the roommate should just buy her own food is practical, but considering the roommate's financial situation isn't provided. However, the author mentions the roommate's parents support her, implying she has resources.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's right to privacy and ownership of her food is valid. Roommates should respect each other's belongings. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The key is whether the method of setting those boundaries was considerate enough.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the roommate is clearly in the wrong for taking food without consent. The author's criticism is about the lack of self-control, which is a reasonable expectation. However, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps offering support or discussing alternatives before confronting her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries and confronting the issue, but could have handled it with more sensitivity. The roommate's actions are the primary issue here. The answer should be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong, though there's room for improvement in approach.\n"
