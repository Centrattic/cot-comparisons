We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a roommate with a bulimic disorder who is taking the author's food. The author confronted the roommate and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's condition. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that affects a person's control over their eating behaviors. If the roommate is struggling with this, she might not be able to control her impulses, even if she knows it's wrong. The author points out that the roommate replaces the food, but the issue is about the act of taking it without permission. \n\nThe author's main argument is that it's not acceptable for the roommate to take their food, just like one wouldn't do that at a store or someone else's table. They argue that the roommate should exercise restraint. However, the roommate is in a vulnerable mental health state, which complicates things. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their belongings and should feel comfortable in their own home. On the other hand, the roommate has a disorder that impairs her self-control, and the author's approach might have been harsh, especially since the roommate is already in distress. The author could have tried to find a solution together, like setting boundaries or offering to help the roommate find resources, rather than just telling her to \"control herself.\"\n\nThe author mentioned the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's already seeking help. Confronting her directly might have been necessary, but the way it was handled\u2014without empathy\u2014could have worsened the situation. The author's response might come off as dismissive of the roommate's struggles, even if they didn't mean to. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author has the right to their food, the roommate's mental health is a factor that the author might not have fully considered. The author could have been more understanding and offered support, but they didn't do that. Instead, they reacted with anger and told the roommate to buy her own food, which might not be feasible if the roommate is in a vulnerable financial situation despite being supported by her parents. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might not be entirely wrong for standing up for their belongings, but their approach could have been more compassionate. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the key points are the lack of empathy and the potential harshness of the response. The author might have a valid complaint about the food being taken, but their reaction might be seen as contributing to the problem. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to their property, but there's a nuance here. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the answer is B for No.\n"
