We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the roommate has bulimia and is taking the author's food. The author confronts her, and the roommate breaks down. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is cooking for themselves because they're on a budget, and the roommate is taking their food. Even though the roommate replaces the items, the author is upset because their food is being taken without permission. The roommate has a mental health issue, which complicates things because it's not as simple as just being inconsiderate. \n\nBut the author didn't accuse her harshly; they confronted her and were understanding of her condition. The author also sets boundaries by saying that if the roommate needs to eat, she should buy her own food. That seems reasonable because the author is supporting themselves and can't afford to share. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so maybe she's struggling and hasn't had help yet. \n\nHowever, the author's response might have been a bit abrupt. They told her she's wrong and that it's not acceptable, which might not consider the mental health aspect. But the author did acknowledge the roommate's problem and tried to be nice afterward. The key point is whether the author had the right to ask the roommate to control herself. Since the roommate's condition is medical, it's not as simple as just \"controlling\" herself. But the author is within their rights to ask for their property not to be taken. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. They can't be expected to allow someone to take their food, even if it's due to a mental health issue. The roommate's actions are violating the author's space and belongings. However, maybe the author could have handled it with more empathy, but the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether their approach was the best possible. \n\nIn the end, the author is justified in asking for their food to be respected. So the answer is B.\n"
