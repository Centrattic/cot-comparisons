We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author and their roommate are both 20, living together. The roommate is bulimic and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with similar items. The author confronts her, and the roommate is upset, explaining her illness and waiting for treatment. The author responds by saying that even though the roommate has a problem, it's not their responsibility and that the roommate should buy her own food since she's supported by her parents. The author feels justified because they think the roommate should exercise restraint, similar to not taking food from a store or restaurant.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they're protecting their own property and setting boundaries. They're not saying the roommate's illness isn't valid, but they're holding her accountable for her actions. The roommate's behavior is causing conflict, and the author is frustrated because their food is being taken without consent. They also mention that the roommate replaces the items, but the author is still bothered by the fact that someone is taking their belongings. The author's main point is about respecting boundaries and personal property, regardless of the roommate's mental health issues.\n\nBut on the other hand, the roommate is dealing with a serious eating disorder. Bulimia can lead to loss of control over eating, and the author's food might be triggering the behavior. Even if the roommate knows it's wrong, the illness might make it difficult for her to resist. The author's response might come off as harsh, especially in the moment when the roommate is already vulnerable and crying. The author could be seen as not being supportive, even though they're not the roommate's family or therapist.\n\nNow, considering the balance between personal boundaries and mental health. The author has a right to their own property and to set limits on how others use it. The roommate's actions are indeed taking without permission, which is a violation of trust and respect. The author isn't attacking the roommate for her illness but is addressing the behavior. However, the author's approach might not be the most compassionate way to handle a situation involving someone with an eating disorder. It's possible that the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps suggesting solutions like eating together or finding another way to manage the roommate's needs without taking their food.\n\nBut the key here is that the author didn't blame the roommate for her illness but held her accountable for her actions. The author also mentioned trying to be nice afterward, which shows some consideration. The roommate's responsibility to control her actions, even with her illness, is a point the author makes. However, eating disorders can impair judgment and self-control, so it's a complex issue.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the main factors are personal responsibility and empathy. The author is within their rights to set boundaries about their own property. The roommate's actions are inappropriate, and the author is not obligated to allow others to take their things. However, the way the issue was addressed could have been more supportive. But in the context of the question, the focus is on whether the author is wrong for asking the roommate to control herself. Since the author is setting a boundary and not attacking the illness itself, it's more about the behavior rather than the person.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is justified in asking for respect of their property, even while acknowledging the roommate's mental health issues. The conflict arises from the roommate's actions, not the author's stance on the illness.\n"
