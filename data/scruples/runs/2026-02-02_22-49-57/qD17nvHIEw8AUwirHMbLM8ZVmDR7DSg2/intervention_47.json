We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The roommate has a mental health issue and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author cooks a lot because they're on a budget and the roommate is taking their food, replacing it with different items. The author confronted the roommate, who then broke down crying. The author feels justified in their anger because they believe the roommate can control her behavior, similar to not taking from a store or restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can be difficult to manage, especially without proper treatment. The roommate is already struggling and on a waitlist, which adds context to her actions. However, the author is also dealing with their budget and their personal property being taken without consent. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the roommate's behavior is unacceptable regardless of her mental health, and she should exert self-control. But is it fair to expect someone in a mental health crisis to manage their impulses without support? The roommate's actions are a symptom of her illness, not a personal failing. However, the author has the right to their property and to set boundaries. \n\nThe confrontation might have been handled more sensitively. The author came off as angry and dismissive, which could have exacerbated the roommate's distress. But the core issue is about ownership and consent. The author isn't wrong for wanting their food to be respected. The roommate's mental health complicates things, but the author isn't responsible for her disorder. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't the asshole. They have a right to their property and to ask for boundaries. The roommate's actions are a result of her illness, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate that without a solution. The answer should be B.\n"
