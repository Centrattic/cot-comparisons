We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked about their bulimic roommate is in the wrong. The situation is that the roommate is taking their food without permission, even though they replace it. The author confronted them, and the roommate is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can affect a person's control over their impulses. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so they might not have the resources or support they need right now. However, the author is also in a tough position because their belongings are being taken without consent, which is theft regardless of the reason.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're not okay with someone eating their food, even if it's being replaced. They also mention that their roommate can control herself in other situations, like at restaurants or the grocery store. The author is frustrated that their food is being taken, which is understandable. They\u2019re not just upset about the cost but the violation of personal space and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate is dealing with a mental health issue that's causing these behaviors. The author's response might have been harsh, especially leading to the roommate crying and them not speaking since. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy or sought a compromise, like helping the roommate find resources or setting clearer boundaries before confronting them.\n\nHowever, the core issue here is about personal property. The roommate isn't asking for permission to take the food, which is a breach of privacy and trust. The author's frustration is valid, especially considering the financial aspect since they support themselves and are cooking on a budget. The author isn't wrong to want their belongings respected.\n\nBut there's a balance between understanding the roommate's mental health and enforcing boundaries. The author might have handled the confrontation poorly, causing emotional harm. Still, the act of taking someone's food without consent is a problem regardless of the reason. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this issue, but maybe their approach was too harsh. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not if they could have handled it better.\n\nIn the end, the key points are that the roommate is violating the author's property rights, and the author is within their rights to ask for this to stop. While the roommate's mental health is a factor, it doesn't justify taking food without permission. The author's stance that it's not socially acceptable to take others' property, regardless of personal issues, is correct. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
