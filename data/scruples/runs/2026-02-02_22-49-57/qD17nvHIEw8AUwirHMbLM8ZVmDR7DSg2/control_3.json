We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. The roommate is taking the author's food because of her bulimia, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is cooking meals because they're on a budget and can't afford to eat out. They notice their food is being taken and replaced with different products. When confronted, the roommate explains her bulimia and that she's on a waitlist for treatment. The author tells her that even though it's a problem, it's not their responsibility and suggests she buys her own food since her parents support her.\n\nFrom the author's side, they have a right to their own property. It's not okay for someone to take another person's food without permission, regardless of the reason. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for maintaining respect in any living situation. The roommate isn't a child, so the author isn't being unreasonable by expecting her to manage her impulses. The fact that the roommate replaces the food might help, but it doesn't negate the act of taking without permission. The author's frustration is understandable.\n\nOn the roommate's side, she has a mental health issue that she's struggling with. Bulimia is a serious disorder, and she's on a waitlist for treatment, which implies she's trying to get help. However, having a mental health issue doesn't excuse taking someone else's property. While the author might feel empathy for her situation, the act of taking food is still a violation of boundaries. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for holding her accountable for her actions despite her condition.\n\nThe author didn't confront her out of malice but because they were upset their food was being taken. They also tried to be understanding by acknowledging the roommate's problem but still set a boundary. The roommate's reaction (crying and not speaking since) is a result of her own actions, not necessarily the author's approach. The author isn't being cruel but is asserting their rights. \n\nIn shared living situations, mutual respect is crucial. The author isn't wrong for expecting their roommate to respect their belongings. While the roommate's condition is tragic, it's not the author's responsibility to accommodate her inability to control her impulses beyond a certain point. The author's response\u2014telling her to buy her own food if she needs it\u2014is reasonable given that the roommate has financial support from her parents.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong for asking the roommate to control herself. They're maintaining their own boundaries and not allowing their roommate's condition to infringe on their personal property without consent. The answer should be B.\n"
