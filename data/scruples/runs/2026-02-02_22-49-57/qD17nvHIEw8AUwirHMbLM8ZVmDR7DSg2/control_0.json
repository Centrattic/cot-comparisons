We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia who takes the author's food without permission. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is cooking meals for themselves because of a budget and doesn't want others to take their food. They confronted the roommate when they noticed things missing or switched. The roommate then admitted she has bulimia and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author told her that she should control herself and buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their belongings. Taking someone else's food without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. The author isn't being cruel; they're standing up for their own property. The roommate's issue is a health problem, but that doesn't justify taking without asking. \n\nOn the other hand, the roommate is dealing with a serious eating disorder. She might not have full control over her actions and is seeking treatment. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy, maybe offering to help her find resources or solutions instead of just cutting her off. However, the author did apologize and is trying to be nice now. \n\nThe key points are consent and respect for personal property. The roommate's actions are the issue here, not the author's response. The author isn't being mean for no reason. They're asking her to respect boundaries, which is reasonable. Even if someone has a problem, others aren't responsible for solving it for them. The author is within their rights to ask for their food not to be taken. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have discussed it earlier, set clear boundaries before confronting her. However, the confrontation happened after the fact. The roommate's actions were unacceptable regardless of her condition. The author's response was firm but not cruel. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their own property and setting boundaries. The roommate needs to take responsibility for her actions and seek help. The answer should be B.\n"
