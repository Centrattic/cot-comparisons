We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where their roommate has bulimia and has been taking their food without permission. The author confronted the roommate, who then cried and explained her condition. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to ask her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The roommate has a mental health issue, which is serious. Bulimia can be a compulsive disorder, so the roommate might not have control over her actions. However, the author is paying for their own food and is within their rights to be upset about someone taking their property without consent. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author cooked food they paid for, and the roommate, despite knowing it's wrong, couldn't control herself. The author confronted her, which is a reasonable response when someone is taking things without permission. The roommate's health is a concern, but the author also has the right to their belongings. \n\nThe author's response\u2014telling the roommate to buy her own food if she can't control herself\u2014might seem harsh, but considering that the roommate's family supports her financially, maybe it's a valid point. However, the roommate is in a vulnerable state, and the confrontation might have been handled more compassionately. \n\nBut the author also tried to be understanding, acknowledging the roommate's struggle. They didn't yell or threaten, just expressed their frustration. The roommate's reaction indicates that the confrontation was hurtful, but the author's main point is about ownership and respect for property. \n\nIn terms of social norms, taking someone's belongings without permission is generally not acceptable, regardless of the reason. The author is not asking the roommate to fix her bulimia, just to stop taking their food. So, the author's stance seems justified. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like suggesting professional help or setting clearer boundaries without being confrontational. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't do anything illegal and are within their rights to ask for their food to be respected, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the way the confrontation happened might have been hurtful, but that doesn't necessarily make the author the asshole. They're standing up for their belongings, which is understandable.\n"
