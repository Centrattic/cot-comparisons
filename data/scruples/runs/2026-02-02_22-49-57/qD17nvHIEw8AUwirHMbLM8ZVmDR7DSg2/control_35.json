We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia who takes the author's food, and the author confronts her, leading to a breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The roommate has a diagnosed eating disorder, which is a serious mental health issue. Bulimia can involve cycles of bingeing and purging, which might explain the stealing behavior. The author is upset about their food being taken and replaced, which is understandable because it's their property.\n\nThe author confronted the roommate, who then broke down crying and explained her condition. The author responded by saying it's not their problem and that the roommate should buy her own food. The author also compared it to stealing in public, implying the behavior is wrong regardless of the mental health issue.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has the right to their property and is within their rights to be upset about it being taken without permission. The roommate's actions are indeed taking something that isn't hers, which is a violation. The author is not obligated to enable someone else's harmful behavior, especially if it's affecting them directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition that's causing this behavior. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps offering support or suggesting professional help. The author's response was harsh, which might have exacerbated the roommate's emotional state. However, the author also made it clear that they don't want to be responsible for the roommate's actions and are setting boundaries.\n\nThe community often looks at AITA posts to see if the person acted unreasonably. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable, but the way they enforced it might be seen as lacking empathy. However, given that the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, the author isn't ignoring the issue but is holding the roommate accountable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have handled the situation more sensitively, their stance that the roommate needs to control her behavior isn't unreasonable. The key is that the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around their property. The roommate's actions are the issue, not the author's response to them. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
