We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The main issue is that the roommate is taking the author's food without permission, and the author confronted her. The roommate explained that she has bulimia and can't control herself, even though she knows it's wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is paying for their own food and is on a budget, so having their food taken without consent is a problem. It's understandable that they'd be upset about their belongings being used without permission. Food is a basic need, but so is respecting others' property.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition\u2014bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can make someone engage in binge-purge cycles. She's on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but might not have the resources or support right now. She is trying to replace the food, but that doesn't negate the fact that she's taking things without asking. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she should control herself and that if she needs food, she should buy her own. The author also mentioned that they don't take food from others in public places, so why is it okay for the roommate to take from them? That makes sense logically, but the roommate is in a vulnerable mental state. \n\nBut the key here is consent. Even if someone has a mental health issue, taking another person's property without permission is a violation. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their own belongings. However, the way the confrontation went down might have been harsh. The roommate was emotionally affected, and the author's response was firm but perhaps didn't account for the roommate's mental health crisis. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect someone with a mental illness to control themselves? Maybe in a public setting, but in a shared living space, boundaries are important. The author's frustration is valid. They can't be expected to support someone else's disorder by providing their food. However, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy and offered to help the roommate find resources or support while also setting clear boundaries. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to their own space and belongings. However, the way they handled the confrontation could have been more compassionate. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, based on the facts, the answer might be B, not the asshole, because they had the right to ask for their food to be respected, even if the roommate has an illness.\n"
