We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. The situation involves the roommate taking the author's food, which the author discovered and confronted. The roommate admitted to being bulimic and on a waitlist for treatment. The author feels upset that the roommate isn't controlling herself and is upset about the food being taken, even if it's being replaced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is paying for the food and it's their property. It's understandable that they'd be upset about someone taking their stuff without permission. Even if the roommate is replacing it, the act of taking without consent is an issue. The author has a right to expect boundaries regarding their personal property.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition\u2014bulimia is a serious eating disorder. People with bulimia often struggle with control over their eating behaviors. The roommate is aware of the problem and is seeking treatment but is on a waitlist. The author's confrontation might have been harsh, but the roommate's actions are driven by an illness beyond their control at that moment.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. The author isn't asking the roommate to have the disorder go away but to control their behavior regarding shared living spaces. However, expecting someone with a mental health issue to have perfect control might be unrealistic without treatment. The author did confront the roommate, and the roommate did apologize and show remorse. The author's response was to point out that the roommate's parents can support her, which might imply that the problem is the roommate's responsibility to manage. But bulimia is a medical condition that requires professional help, which the roommate is seeking.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they are within their rights to be upset about their food being taken. However, the way they responded might not have been the most empathetic. They could have offered support or suggested solutions, like using separate storage or discussing with the roommate's healthcare provider. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the roommate's actions are a result of a medical condition, the author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, the way they handled it might not be the best approach. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. The author isn't being cruel without reason; they are protecting their property. The roommate, on the other hand, has a condition that affects her behavior. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
