We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without asking, even replacing it sometimes. The author confronted her, she cried, and now there's tension. The author is questioning if they were right to do so.\n\nThe key points here are: the roommate has a mental health issue, the author is on a budget and cooking for themselves, the roommate is taking food and trying to replace it, and the author confronted her. The author's argument is that regardless of the roommate's condition, taking someone else's food isn't acceptable. The roommate's side is that she's struggling with an eating disorder and is in treatment but on a waitlist.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has a right to their belongings, including food. It's not okay to take things without permission, even with a mental health condition. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they're managing a budget and cooking daily. They had a right to address the issue directly, especially after noticing ongoing behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate is dealing with a serious eating disorder, which is a health issue. The author's response was firm and public, leading to the roommate breaking down. The confrontation might have been harsh, but the author's intent was to set boundaries. The roommate's actions are a result of her illness, which isn't her fault, but the author is also within their rights to ask for their space and belongings to be respected.\n\nThe author didn't accuse her of something they didn't do; they observed the behavior and confronted her. The roommate admitted her issue, so the author's response was based on the truth. The author also suggested that the roommate can buy her own food, which is a reasonable solution. The author's main point is about mutual respect and boundaries in a shared living space.\n\nMental health issues don't excuse taking others' property, but they do require empathy. The author showed some empathy by trying to be nice afterward but stood their ground. The roommate's responsibility is to seek treatment and manage her condition, which she's attempting. The author's actions were about self-respect and setting clear boundaries, which are important in any living situation.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their belongings and setting boundaries, even though the roommate has a health issue. The roommate needs to take responsibility for her actions, and the author is justified in asking her to do so.\n"
