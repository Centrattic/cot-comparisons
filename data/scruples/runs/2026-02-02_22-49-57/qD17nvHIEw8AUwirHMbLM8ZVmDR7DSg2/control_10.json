We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. \n\nFirst, the roommate has a bulimia issue and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with different products sometimes. The author confronts her, and the roommate breaks down, explaining her condition and being on a waitlist for treatment. The author responds by saying it's not their problem and that the roommate should buy her own food since her parents support her. They also mention that they don't understand why the roommate can't control herself.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they're paying for their own food, cooking a lot, and the roommate is taking it without permission. The author feels it's unfair and is asking the roommate to respect their property, similar to how one wouldn't take food from a store or another person's table. They want the roommate to control her impulses, even with her condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health issue that affects her control. She's on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's trying but hasn't received help yet. The author's response might be seen as harsh, considering the roommate is struggling with a serious condition. However, the author is also within their rights to expect their belongings to be respected. \n\nThe key points here are the roommate's mental health and the author's right to their property. The author didn't accuse the roommate of stealing but pointed out the behavior and expressed their discomfort. The roommate's issue is a medical condition, but that doesn't mean the author is obligated to accommodate it without some boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be seen as not offering support. Instead of suggesting alternatives or discussing possible solutions together, like sharing expenses or setting specific times for eating, they cut off communication. The author's tone could be perceived as dismissive of the roommate's struggle, even if they understand the condition is real. \n\nBut, the roommate is an adult and capable of managing her own behavior. The author isn't asking her to cure bulimia, just to not take food without permission. The author's frustration is justified because their property is being taken without consent. While the roommate's condition is a factor, it's not an excuse for taking someone else's belongings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people don't take others' food without asking. The author isn't being cruel but is standing up for their own rights. However, they could have approached the situation with more empathy and possibly offered some support, given the roommate's circumstances. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is asserting their right to their property and the roommate's actions are unethical regardless of her condition, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They did confront the roommate calmly, expressed their feelings, and set boundaries. The roommate's condition doesn't absolve her of responsibility for respecting others' property. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), but there's a balance. However, the author could have been more empathetic in their approach. Still, the core issue is the unauthorized use of personal property, which is a valid concern. The author isn't the asshole here because they're within their rights to expect their food to be respected, and the roommate's condition doesn't justify stealing. The author's frustration is reasonable given the situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
