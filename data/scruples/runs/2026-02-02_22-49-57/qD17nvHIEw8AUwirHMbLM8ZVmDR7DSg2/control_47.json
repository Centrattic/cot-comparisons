We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the roommate has bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. The author notices that their food is being taken and replaced with different products. They confront the roommate, who breaks down and explains her condition. The author responds by saying they don't want to be part of her problem and tells her to buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Bulimia is a mental health issue that can be challenging to manage. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but might not have the resources or control right now. The author is frustrated because their property is being taken without permission, even if it's being replaced. But is it okay to take someone else's food regardless of the reasons?\n\nThe author's main argument is that they don't want to enable the behavior and that the roommate should take responsibility. They compare it to taking food from a store or another person's table, which is indeed wrong. However, the key difference here is the personal relationship. The roommate is a person struggling with an illness, not just someone being greedy or inconsiderate. \n\nBut then, property rights are important. The author is paying for the food, and others have a right to their belongings. The roommate's actions, regardless of the reason, are a violation of that right. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, is about setting boundaries. However, the way they handled it might have been insensitive. Confronting someone with a mental health issue can be tricky. The author could have offered support instead of just telling her to buy her own food, especially since her parents support her. \n\nBut the author is also on a budget and cooking for a reason. They can't afford to eat out, so it's a financial issue. The roommate's actions are impacting the author's ability to manage their own expenses. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they had the right to ask their roommate to stop taking their food. On the other hand, the way they handled it might have been confrontational and lacked empathy. However, the roommate's mental health is a factor. The author might not have considered alternative solutions, like suggesting the roommate get more help or setting up a system to separate their food.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being reasonable in their expectations. They have a right to their property, but maybe they could have approached the situation with more understanding. However, since the roommate is an adult and the author is also an adult, expecting some level of responsibility is fair. The author's response might be justified in terms of setting boundaries, but the manner could have been more empathetic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having those expectations. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding their own property. However, they could have handled the situation more compassionately. But in terms of whether they're an asshole, the main issue is about respecting their own belongings, which is valid.\n"
