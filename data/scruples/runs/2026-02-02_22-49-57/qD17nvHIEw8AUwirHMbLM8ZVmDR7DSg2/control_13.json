We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has bulimia and is taking the author's food, replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, and she cried, explaining her condition. The author is upset because they can't control her behavior and wants her to buy her own food. The question is whether the author was wrong to ask this.\n\nSo, the key points are: the roommate's mental health issue (bulimia), the act of taking food, and the author's response. \n\nBulimia is a serious eating disorder where control over eating behaviors is difficult. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which means she's seeking help but hasn't received it yet. The author is in a shared living space and has a budget, cooking for themselves. The roommate isn't cooking and is taking food without permission.\n\nThe author's main argument is that it's not socially acceptable to take others' property, even with a mental health issue. They compare it to not taking food from a grocery store or someone else's table. The roommate is aware she's doing something wrong but can't control herself.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author has a right to their belongings, including food. The roommate's actions are a violation of that right. The author is also on a budget and cooking for themselves, so the food isn't just extras. The author is not being cruel; they're setting boundaries. The roommate's actions are harmful and need to be addressed, but the author's response is to set a clear boundary by asking her to control herself or buy her own food.\n\nHowever, the roommate is struggling with a mental health condition, which affects her control. The author might not be aware of the severity of bulimia, which can lead to compulsive behaviors. The author's approach might be seen as not considering the roommate's health, but the roommate is aware of her actions and is seeking help. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, maybe offering support or suggesting solutions like buying groceries together or setting up a communal food area. But the core issue is that the roommate is taking without permission, which is a breach of trust and boundaries.\n\nThe author's response was direct but not necessarily cruel. They apologized for making her cry and are trying to be nice since the confrontation. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding the roommate accountable for taking their food. Since the roommate is aware she's doing something wrong, the author's demand for control is reasonable given the shared living situation. The author isn't dismissing her condition but is stating that the behavior is unacceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their property and are setting a boundary. The roommate's actions are a problem that needs to be addressed, and the author is within their rights to ask her to stop. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
