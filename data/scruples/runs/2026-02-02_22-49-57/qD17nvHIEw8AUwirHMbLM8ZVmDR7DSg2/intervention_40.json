We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. The situation involves the roommate taking the author's food, which the author found out and confronted her about. The roommate admitted to being bulimic and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author is frustrated because they can't afford to eat out and cook a lot, and they feel that even though the roommate has an issue, it's not their problem. They told the roommate to buy her own food since her parents support her. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to be so firm.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the roommate's mental health and the author's boundaries. The roommate has a bulimia problem, which is a serious eating disorder. She's trying to replace the food she takes, but the author is uncomfortable with the fact that it's their property being taken without permission. The author is also on a budget and can't afford to have their food taken, which adds to the stress.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their own property and can set boundaries. It's understandable that they're upset about someone eating their food without asking, especially since the roommate is able to buy her own. The author is not in a position to support the roommate financially beyond what they already do by sharing the apartment. The roommate's parents support her, so maybe she can use that to buy her own food. The author is trying to be fair but firm.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health issue that's affecting her behavior. She's on a waitlist for treatment, so she might be struggling with control. The author's confrontation might have been harsh, especially since the roommate broke down crying. The author's frustration is valid, but maybe they could have approached it with more empathy while still setting boundaries. However, the author isn't obligated to accommodate the roommate's disorder in a way that violates their own limits. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author isn't refusing help or being cruel; they're stating their boundaries. The roommate is an adult and responsible for her own actions. The author is within their rights to ask for their property to be respected. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is setting a reasonable boundary and isn't ignoring the roommate's issue but isn't taking responsibility for it either. However, there's a balance between empathy and personal limits. The author's response was direct but not malicious. They acknowledged the roommate's problem but still expected her to meet her needs without encroaching on the author's resources. So, probably B.\n"
