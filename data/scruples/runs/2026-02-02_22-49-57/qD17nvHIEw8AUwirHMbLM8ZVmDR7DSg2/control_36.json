We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate with bulimia who takes the author's food without permission. The author confronted her, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue\u2014bulimia. That's a serious condition where someone might lose control over eating. The author is upset because their food is being taken, even if it's replaced. They feel it's not their responsibility to manage someone else's health problems. \n\nThe roommate's side of the fridge is almost empty, implying she might not be buying her own food. The author mentions that the roommate's parents support her financially, so maybe she can afford her own groceries. The author's argument is that it's not okay to take others' food regardless of the reason, similar to how you wouldn't take from a store or someone else's meal at a restaurant.\n\nBut wait, the roommate is struggling with an illness. The author is asking her to control herself, which might be really hard when someone is in the throes of an eating disorder. Bulimia can involve compulsive behaviors that are difficult to resist. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe they could have approached the situation with more empathy first. \n\nHowever, the author did confront her, and the roommate admitted the issue. The author's response was firm but maybe not cruel. They acknowledged the problem but set boundaries. The roommate's reaction was emotional, but the author didn't attack her personally. \n\nThe key points here are the balance between respecting personal space and showing compassion. The author is maintaining their own boundaries, which is reasonable. On the other hand, maybe they could have offered support instead of just telling her to buy her own food. But the roommate's own resources (parents' support) are available. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong: taking someone's food without consent is a violation of personal property. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their belongings. However, the situation is complicated by the roommate's mental health. The author might have handled it more sensitively, but the act of confronting and setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
