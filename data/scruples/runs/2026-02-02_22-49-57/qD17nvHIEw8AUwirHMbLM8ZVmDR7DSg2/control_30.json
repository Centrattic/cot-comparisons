We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. The roommate is taking the author's food, which is causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's situation. She has bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. She mentioned being on a waitlist for treatment, so she might be struggling and not able to manage her impulses right now. The author is paying for their own food, which is a valid concern because it's their money and their stuff. \n\nThe roommate is replacing the food but the author is upset about the fact that someone is taking their belongings, regardless of the reason. The author's main point is that it's not acceptable to take others' property, even with a disorder. They compared it to taking from a grocery store or a restaurant, which isn't acceptable. \n\nBut wait, the roommate isn't stealing in the traditional sense because she's replacing the items. However, the act of taking without permission is still an issue. The author is within their rights to be upset about their property being used without consent. On the other hand, the roommate is dealing with a mental health issue that affects her control. \n\nIs the author being too harsh? They did confront the roommate, who was emotional and apologetic. The author's response was to tell her to buy her own food since her parents support her. That might come off as dismissive of the roommate's mental health struggle. \n\nBut the author also points out that they understand there's an issue but don't agree that it's their responsibility to accommodate it. They\u2019re asking for basic respect of personal property. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the roommate should be trying to manage her condition, perhaps using her own food. The author isn't asking for special treatment, just to have their things respected. However, the way the author confronted her might have been harsh, but the core issue of food being taken without permission is valid. \n\nSo, is the author the asshole? It's a tough call. On one hand, they have a right to their belongings. On the other, the roommate has a mental health issue. But the author's stance is reasonable in expecting others not to take their property, regardless of the reason. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because respecting personal boundaries is important, and the roommate should be handling her situation without taking from others.\n"
