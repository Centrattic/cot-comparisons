We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has a bulimic disorder and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with similar products but not the exact ones. The author confronts her, she breaks down, and there's tension now. The author argues that it's their food and the roommate should control herself, even if she has an eating disorder. They also mention that the roommate's parents support her financially, so she can buy her own food.\n\nNow, the key points here. The roommate has a mental health issue, which is a significant factor. Bulimia is a serious condition, and people with it often struggle with control over their eating behaviors. However, the author's point is about ownership of property and reasonable expectations. The author is paying for the food themselves and feels their property is being taken without consent, even if the roommate is doing it due to her disorder.\n\nBut where's the line? The author might not be wrong in setting boundaries. It's reasonable to expect roommates to respect each other's belongings. However, the approach taken by the author might have been harsh, especially without understanding the roommate's condition before confronting her. The author didn't know about the bulimia until the confrontation, which could have been handled more sensitively.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate should have communicated her issue earlier. Taking someone else's food without permission is problematic regardless of the reason. The author's reaction\u2014telling her it's not acceptable and that she should buy her own food\u2014might be justified because the roommate is an adult and has the means to do so. However, the emotional impact of the confrontation led to the roommate crying and a breakdown, which might suggest the author could have approached it more compassionately.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the act of setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. However, the way the confrontation was handled might not have been the best approach. The author could have offered support or suggested solutions together, like helping her find affordable food or suggesting she seek immediate help. Instead, the author's response was more about blame and expecting control, which might have been hurtful despite the validity of the concern.\n\nBut considering the roommate's mental health issue, the author's responsibility isn't to fix it but to address their own boundaries. The roommate is responsible for her actions, and while empathy is important, the author isn't obligated to tolerate theft, even if it's due to a disorder. However, the balance between setting boundaries and showing empathy is tricky here.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for confronting the issue, but the method could have been more considerate. The roommate's mental health is a factor, but the author also has rights regarding their property. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but with the caveat that a more supportive approach would have been better.\n"
