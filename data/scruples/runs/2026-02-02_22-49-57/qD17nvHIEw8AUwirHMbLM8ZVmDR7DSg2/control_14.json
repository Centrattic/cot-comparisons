We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (F20) is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a known eating disorder and is on a waitlist for treatment. She's taking food from the author's supplies and trying to replace it. The author confronts her, and the roommate apologizes but explains her condition. The author feels justified in asking her to control herself and mentions that the roommate can buy her own food since she's supported by her parents.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the roommate has a mental health issue, the author is upset about their own food being taken, and they expect self-control. The author's argument is that it's not acceptable to take others' property regardless of the situation, similar to not taking from stores or others' tables. The roommate, however, is struggling with a disorder that affects her self-control.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has a right to their property and can be upset about it being taken without consent. They are also on a budget and cooking for themselves, which adds to the frustration. On the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition that impairs her ability to control her actions. The author's response might be seen as harsh given the roommate's vulnerability. However, the author isn't blaming her for the condition but is setting a boundary.\n\nThe question is whether the author's demand for self-control is unreasonable. The author points out that the roommate can buy her own food, which is a practical solution. The roommate might need more support or alternative solutions, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for setting a boundary. The situation is complicated by the roommate's mental health, but the author's actions are about their own property and the expectation of mutual respect in a shared living space.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't the asshole. They have a valid concern and are asking for respect of their belongings. The roommate's issue is more about needing help managing her condition, not the author being in the wrong.\n"
