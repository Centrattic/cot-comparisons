We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about her bulimia-related behavior. The roommate has been taking the author's food, which the author finds unacceptable. The author confronted her, and the roommate became emotional, explaining her bulimia and being on a waitlist for treatment. The author feels justified because they can't afford to eat out and cook for themselves, and they think the roommate should control herself. \n\nFirst, the roommate's health is a significant factor. Bulimia is a serious mental health issue that can make it hard for someone to control their impulses. The roommate is seeking help but is stuck on a waitlist. That context is important because it shows she's struggling with a condition that isn't easily controlled, especially without proper treatment.\n\nThe author's perspective is understandable\u2014no one likes their property taken without permission. However, the situation involves a roommate with a mental health issue. The author's response was direct, which might have been necessary given the ongoing issue, but the emotional impact on the roommate is notable. The author's argument that the roommate should control herself like they do is logical, but it doesn't account for the fact that bulimia affects self-control. \n\nThe author's use of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) suggests internal conflict. They feel justified in their actions but are also feeling bad for causing their roommate emotional distress. The key here is whether the author handled the situation appropriately. They confronted the issue directly, which is reasonable, but maybe the tone or approach could have been more compassionate. \n\nHowever, the author also set boundaries, which is their right. They can't be expected to tolerate someone taking their food without saying anything. The roommate's replacement of items isn't excusing the action, as the author still values their own food and privacy. The author isn't wrong for expecting accountability. \n\nConsidering all angles, while the roommate's health is a factor, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their own belongings and setting clear boundaries. The problem is a complex mix of personal space and mental health, but the author's actions are within their rights. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
