We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about taking food, given the roommate's bulimia.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue\u2014bulimia. She's on a waitlist for treatment, which means she's actively seeking help but hasn't received it yet. The author noticed food being taken and replaced, which they found upsetting. They confronted her, and the roommate admitted to taking the food due to her condition. The author then told her it's not their problem and that she should buy her own food since her parents support her. The roommate was upset, and they haven't spoken since.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is in a shared living space and feels their property is being violated. They have a right to control their own belongings. However, the roommate has a mental health disorder that's affecting her behavior. The author's response was direct and somewhat blunt, pointing out that the roommate's actions are unacceptable, even if she has an issue. The author also mentions that they don't want to enable her by providing food, expecting her to take responsibility.\n\nBut there's a balance here. The author did confront the roommate after she admitted to the problem, which is reasonable. However, the roommate is struggling with a disorder and might need support. The author's response might come off as judgmental, especially given the emotional state of the roommate. The author's argument that the roommate should control herself because she's an adult might not consider the severity of bulimia, which can impair self-control. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to expect their property not to be taken, regardless of the roommate's condition. They have their own financial constraints and can't afford to eat out, so using their food without permission is an issue. The author's frustration is valid because it's not just about the food but the lack of consent. \n\nThe roommate's actions, while influenced by her mental health, are still taking something that belongs to someone else. The author isn't wrong to address this, but perhaps the confrontation could have been handled more empathetically. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they confronted the roommate and clearly stated their boundaries, they aren't in the wrong. The roommate's condition doesn't excuse the behavior, and the author has the right to enforce their space. But there's a nuance here\u2014maybe the author could have offered some support or suggested solutions instead of just cutting off the relationship. Still, their main point is valid: they shouldn't have to provide food for someone else's compulsive behavior.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are standing up for their own boundaries and property, even if the situation is complex due to the roommate's mental health.\n"
