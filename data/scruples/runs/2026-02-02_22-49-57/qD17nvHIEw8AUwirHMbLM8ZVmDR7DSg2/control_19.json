We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue\u2014bulimia. The author found out the roommate was taking their food, even replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, and the roommate cried, explaining her condition and being on a waitlist for treatment. The author then told her that she should buy her own food and criticized her for not controlling herself.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the roommate has a medical condition she's struggling with, which might affect her self-control. On the other hand, the author is being responsible with their own resources, especially since they're on a budget and support themselves. The roommate's parents support her financially, so maybe she should be able to buy her own food instead of taking from the author.\n\nBut wait, even if the roommate's actions are due to her illness, does that absolve her of responsibility? The author has a right to their own property. The roommate taking food without permission is stealing, regardless of her condition. However, the author's approach might have been harsh, especially considering the roommate was already in a vulnerable state. The author could have tried to find a solution together, like setting boundaries or discussing how to handle the situation while respecting her mental health.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for standing up for themselves, but the way they handled the confrontation could have been more empathetic. They might not have considered the roommate's mental health challenges fully. The question is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. Since the roommate's actions are harmful and the author is asking for self-control, which is a reasonable expectation, the author might be justified. However, the emotional response and the aftermath might have been handled better.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because they have a right to their belongings. However, there could be a middle ground. But according to the options, it's either A or B. The main issue is whether the author is the asshole. The author did confront the roommate, but given the circumstances, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
