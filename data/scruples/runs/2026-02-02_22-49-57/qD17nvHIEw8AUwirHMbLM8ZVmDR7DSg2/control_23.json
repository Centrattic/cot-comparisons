We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AskReddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia taking the author's food and the author confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly frustrated that their roommate is taking their food without permission. The roommate has a mental health issue (bulimia) and is on a waitlist for treatment. She replaces the food but it's not the same product, which adds to the author's frustration. The author confronts her, which led to the roommate crying and them not speaking since. The author feels they're not in the wrong because they expect their roommate to control herself, similar to how they would control their own impulses, like not eating someone else's food.\n\nSo, the key points here are: mental health issues affecting behavior, shared living space dynamics, and expectations of privacy and respect. The roommate has a serious condition that's causing her to act in ways she can't control. The author has a right to their belongings and expects boundaries. However, the way the author confronted the roommate might have been harsh, especially if the roommate was already struggling. The author's response was to tell the roommate to control herself and that it's her problem, which could be seen as dismissive of her mental health struggles.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to be upset about their food being taken. It's a shared living situation, but personal property should be respected. The author isn't responsible for the roommate's mental health issues, but how they handled it might have been insensitive. The roommate might need support, not blame. The author's comparison to not taking food in public places is valid, but the roommate's inability to control her impulses in this specific situation complicates things.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The answer likely depends on balancing personal responsibility and empathy. While the author isn't wrong for standing up for their property, the way they handled the confrontation and the lack of support for the roommate's condition might make them partially at fault. However, the roommate's actions are also problematic. It's a bit of a gray area. In similar situations, people often expect roommates to respect boundaries, but when mental health is involved, the approach should be more compassionate. The author could have offered solutions, like helping the roommate find immediate help or setting clear boundaries without being accusatory. By cutting off communication and not showing support, the author might have exacerbated the problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach. However, the question asks if they're in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no), leaning towards B because the author is justified in protecting their property, but their method was questionable. However, in the context of the question, the user might see the author as not in the wrong because they have a right to their belongings and the roommate's behavior is the main issue. So, maybe B.\n"
