We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a roommate with bulimia taking the other person's food. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is the asshole for confronting the roommate.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a serious eating disorder that's affecting her behavior. Bulimia can cause someone to lose control over eating, leading to binge-purge cycles. The roommate's actions are a result of her illness, not just a matter of willpower. She's on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but it's not immediate.\n\nThe OP is cooking all the meals and on a tight budget. The roommate is not cooking and relies on the OP's food. The OP confronts the roommate, who then apologizes and explains her condition. The OP's response is to tell the roommate to buy her own food since her parents support her, which feels dismissive of the roommate's struggle.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and understanding. The roommate's actions are driven by a mental health issue. While the OP has a right to privacy and ownership of their food, the way they handled the situation might be too harsh. The OP didn't consider the roommate's mental health crisis and instead focused on their own frustration. The roommate might not have the control to stop taking the food, even if she knows it's wrong.\n\nThe OP's argument that the roommate should control herself like anyone else might be overlooking the fact that eating disorders aren't just about willpower. They're complex and require professional treatment. The OP's solution of buying her own food might not be feasible if the roommate is already struggling financially, even though she's supported by her parents. The OP might not realize the emotional and psychological impact of the roommate's actions.\n\nHowever, the OP is also within their rights to expect their belongings to be respected. The conflict arises from the roommate's inability to control her impulses due to her condition. The OP's response, while understandable in frustration, might not be compassionate enough. The best approach would have been to discuss boundaries and seek a compromise, like setting up a shared food area and personal storage, or encouraging the roommate to seek help more actively.\n\nIn conclusion, while the OP isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up for their own property, their handling of the situation lacks the necessary empathy and support for the roommate's mental health. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
