We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue\u2014bulimia. The author noticed food being taken and replaced, which upset them. They confronted the roommate, leading to an emotional response from her. The author argues that even with her condition, she should control herself, comparing it to not taking food at a store or from someone else's table.\n\nNow, considering the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious disorder that can affect self-control. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but might not have the resources yet. The author's reaction is understandable in terms of personal property and boundaries, but the situation involves a complex mental health issue.\n\nThe author's approach was direct and confrontational. While they were justified in feeling their food was being taken without consent, the way they addressed it might have been harsh. Telling the roommate that her parents can support her financially could come off as dismissive of her struggle. However, the author has their own financial constraints and boundaries, which are valid.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting someone's health struggles and maintaining personal boundaries. The author did confront the roommate, which is necessary for their own well-being. However, there might have been a more empathetic approach, such as suggesting alternatives like meal planning together or encouraging professional help sooner. But since the roommate was crying and they haven't spoken since, the confrontation might have been too harsh.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not entirely clear. The author has a right to their property and to set boundaries. However, the situation could have been handled with more compassion, considering the roommate's mental health. But given that the roommate was aware of her actions and the author clearly communicated their boundaries, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author is within their rights to set boundaries, though there's room for a more supportive approach.\n"
