We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia taking food without permission.\n\nFirst, the roommate (F20) is taking the author's food, which is clearly an issue. The author confronts her, and she admits to being bulimic and struggling with control. The author is upset because even though the roommate replaces the food, it's still being taken without consent. The author argues that it's not acceptable to take others' property regardless of mental health issues.\n\nThe key points here are the boundaries of shared living. The author is on a budget and cooking for themselves, which is a valid reason to be protective of their food. The roommate's condition is a health issue, but that doesn't necessarily mean others are obligated to accommodate it in this specific way. Taking someone else's food, even if they replace it, is a violation of personal space and trust. The author's frustration is understandable because they're paying for the food and expecting it to be respected.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been harsh. Confronting someone in the middle of a mental health crisis with anger could exacerbate the situation. The roommate was already vulnerable and broke down crying, which the author might not have handled compassionately. While the author is within their rights to expect their food not to be taken, how they addressed it could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut considering the situation, the author isn't entirely wrong. They have a right to their belongings. The roommate's actions are inappropriate regardless of her condition. The author's main point is that they shouldn't have to tolerate someone taking their food without permission, which is a valid boundary. The problem might be more about how the confrontation was handled rather than the act of setting the boundary itself.\n\nSo, balancing personal responsibility and mental health, I think the author isn't in the wrong for setting the boundary, even if the delivery could be improved. The roommate's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
