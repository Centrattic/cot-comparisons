We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate who has bulimia and takes the author's food, leading to a confrontation. \n\nFirst, the author cooks a lot because they're on a budget and supports themselves. The roommate, who is also on a budget but supported by her parents, is taking food without permission. The author confronts her, she breaks down, and explains her bulimia. The author feels that even though there's an issue, the roommate should control herself and buy her own food.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about boundaries and mental health. The author is upset about their food being taken, which is their property. The roommate has a medical condition that's causing this behavior. The author's response was to tell the roommate to buy her own food, which might seem harsh, but they argue it's about personal responsibility.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to be upset about someone taking their belongings. It's not acceptable for someone to take another's property, regardless of their mental health. The author is setting a boundary, which is important. On the other hand, the roommate is struggling with a serious eating disorder, and the author's response might not be the most compassionate way to handle it. However, the roommate's parents support her financially, so maybe she can afford to buy her own food instead of relying on taking from others.\n\nThe author also mentions that the roommate replaces the food, but that doesn't change the fact that taking without permission is wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves and their property. The roommate needs to seek help for her condition, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The author is asking for control, which is a reasonable expectation in a shared living space.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled the confrontation more sensitively. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their approach was the most empathetic. Since the core issue is about taking someone else's property, the author isn't wrong for addressing it. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
