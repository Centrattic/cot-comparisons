We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, the roommate has a known eating disorder (bulimia) and is on a waitlist for treatment. She's been taking the author's food, replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, expressed frustration, and told her to buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nThe author's main points: They cook meals because they're on a budget, don't want their food taken, and think the roommate should control herself. They don't see why taking someone's food is acceptable even with a disorder.\n\nThe roommate's perspective: She's struggling with her health, feels shame, and perhaps can't control her impulses. She's replacing items but the author still feels violated.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author is within their rights to expect their property not to be taken. The roommate's actions are harmful to her health and the author's property. However, the author might not fully grasp the severity of the eating disorder. Bulimia can involve loss of control, so the roommate might not be choosing this behavior consciously. \n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of the roommate's mental health struggles. Telling someone with a disorder to \"control themselves\" might not be realistic if they can't control their behavior. But the author's frustration is valid\u2014no one wants their food taken. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might not be, since they're standing up for their belongings. However, maybe the approach could have been more empathetic. The author could have offered support instead of just anger. But the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the roommate's actions are wrong (taking food), but the author's response might be harsh. The key is whether the author's request was unreasonable. They didn't yell or accuse maliciously; they expressed their feelings. The roommate's health is a separate issue. \n\nSo, the answer is B (author not in the wrong). They have a right to expect their food not to be taken. However, the situation could have been handled with more compassion. But legally and socially, the author isn't wrong for asserting their boundaries.\n"
