We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the roommate has bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. The author noticed their food was being taken, even though the roommate replaces it with different products. The author confronts the roommate, who breaks down and explains her condition. The author responds by saying that while they're sorry, it's not their problem and the roommate should buy her own food since her parents support her. They also compare it to taking food from a grocery store or someone else's table, implying it's not acceptable regardless of the condition.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to their own property and food. It's reasonable to expect that others won't take what isn't theirs. The roommate's actions are indeed taking without permission, even if she replaces it. The author's frustration is valid because they're on a budget and cooking for themselves. It's not unreasonable to expect someone to control their impulses, especially in a shared living situation where boundaries are necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition that affects her self-control. Bulimia involves cycles of binging and purging, which can be hard to manage. She's on a waitlist for treatment, so she might not have the resources to get help immediately. The author's response, while direct, might not account for the severity of the disorder. Telling someone with an eating disorder to \"just control themselves\" can be dismissive and not helpful. However, the author did express empathy initially but set clear boundaries, which is important for their own well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was compassionate enough while still being firm. The author did acknowledge the roommate's issue but also asserted their own needs. The roommate's actions are still taking without permission, which is a violation of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, maybe a better approach would have been to suggest other solutions, like finding a support system or helping her seek treatment, instead of just telling her to buy her own food. But the question is if the author is in the wrong, not if they could have handled it better.\n\nIn the end, the roommate's actions are the issue, not the author's response to protect their own belongings. The author's frustration is justified given the situation. So, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
