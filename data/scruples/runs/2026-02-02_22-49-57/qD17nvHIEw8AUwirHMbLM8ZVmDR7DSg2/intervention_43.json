We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without permission, even replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, and the roommate broke down crying, explaining her condition. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to be upset and to tell her to buy her own food.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is cooking for themselves due to a budget and doesn't want their food taken. The roommate has a mental health issue and is struggling to control her eating habits. The author's reaction was to set boundaries, which led to tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from one angle, everyone has the right to their personal property and should be able to set boundaries. It's reasonable to expect that others don't take your food without permission, especially in a shared living space. The roommate's bulimia is a health issue, but that doesn't excuse taking someone else's property. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting clear limits, which is important for their own well-being.\n\nBut the other side might argue that the author didn't handle it with enough empathy. The roommate was already in a vulnerable state, and the confrontation might have been harsh. However, the author did apologize and is trying to be nice now. Also, the roommate had a chance to explain her situation, and the author acknowledged her problem but still maintained their stance.\n\nI think the author is justified in their actions. They communicated their feelings clearly and set a boundary. It's not about being unsympathetic but about respecting personal space and property. The roommate's issue is her responsibility to manage, and the author isn't obligated to enable that behavior, especially when it's affecting their own resources. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
