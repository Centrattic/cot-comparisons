We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old female sharing an apartment with another 20-year-old female. They\u2019re not friends but get along. The roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with different products. The author confronts her, and the roommate breaks down, explaining her condition and being on a waitlist for treatment. The author responds by saying it's not their problem, that the roommate can buy her own food since her parents support her. The author feels that controlling oneself to not take others' food is reasonable, even with a disorder.\n\nFirst, I should consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder, and the roommate is actively struggling. She's trying to replace the food, which might indicate some awareness or guilt. The author's confrontation was direct and maybe harsh, especially given the roommate's emotional state. However, the author is also in a situation where they can't afford to eat out and are cooking for a budget. The roommate's actions are affecting the author's resources, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their belongings. Taking someone's food without permission is theft, regardless of the reason. The roommate's mental health is a factor, but it doesn't absolve her of responsibility for her actions. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response might have been dismissive of the roommate's mental health crisis. The roommate is in a vulnerable situation, waiting for treatment, and the author's reaction could have exacerbated her emotional distress. The author didn't offer support or suggest alternatives, like helping her find resources or discussing solutions. Instead, they focused on the moral aspect, which might not be the most empathetic approach.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between personal boundaries and compassion. The author isn't wrong in wanting to protect their property, but the way they handled the situation might have lacked empathy. They could have approached it with more understanding, perhaps suggesting ways to manage the roommate's condition while addressing the food issue. However, the roommate's actions are still inappropriate, and the author has a right to be upset. The question is whether the author overstepped by being harsh without considering the roommate's mental health.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The author's actions aren't malicious, but their response might be seen as insensitive. However, the roommate's behavior is also problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the author was reasonable in their approach given the circumstances. Since the author did confront the roommate and set boundaries, but in a way that might have been too abrupt without offering support, it's possible the answer is a mix. But according to the options, it's A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no (not wrong).\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but their approach could have been more compassionate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they did confront the roommate and make a valid point about ownership and responsibility, but also could have been more empathetic, it's a nuanced situation. However, according to typical AITA standards, if the author's actions were justified in protecting their property and maintaining boundaries, then the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The roommate's health is a factor, but the author isn't required to accommodate inappropriate behavior. So I think the answer is B.\n"
