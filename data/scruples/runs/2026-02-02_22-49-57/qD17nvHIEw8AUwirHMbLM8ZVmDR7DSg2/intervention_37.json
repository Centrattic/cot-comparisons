We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about taking food due to bulimia. The author found out their roommate has been taking their food, trying to replace it, and after a confrontation, the roommate admitted to being bulimic and on a waitlist for treatment. The author expressed frustration, saying they understand the roommate's issue but feel it's not their responsibility and that the roommate should control herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can be hard to manage without proper help. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so maybe she's struggling. Taking someone else's food is wrong, but the context of a mental health issue complicates things. The author is in a shared living space and has a right to privacy and ownership of their belongings. The roommate's actions are inappropriate regardless of her condition, but the author's approach might come off as harsh.\n\nThe author confronted the roommate, who was upset and apologized. The author then told the roommate that if she needs to eat, she should buy her own food. The author's reasoning is that it's not acceptable to take others' property, even with mental health issues. But maybe the author could have been more empathetic or offered support, like suggesting the roommate seek help sooner or offering temporary assistance until she gets treatment. However, the author does mention that the roommate's parents support her financially, which might mean she can get her own food. The author's frustration is understandable because their food is being taken without consent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a right to their belongings. The roommate's actions are wrong, regardless of her condition. The author isn't dismissing the roommate's issue entirely; they acknowledge it but set boundaries. However, the confrontation might not have been handled as compassionately as possible. But given that the author is also in a budget situation and cooking for themselves, their expectations are reasonable. The roommate's actions are stealing, which is not excused by mental illness. The author's response, while maybe blunt, is about setting boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
