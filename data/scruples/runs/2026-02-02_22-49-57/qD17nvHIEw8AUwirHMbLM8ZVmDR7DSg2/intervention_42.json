We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user is a female in her early 20s who has been living with her roommate for a year. They're both 20, and they plan to move out soon. The roommate is bulimic and has been taking the user's food, replacing it with different products sometimes. The user confronted her, leading to a crying episode where the roommate admitted her issue. The user then expressed frustration, saying that even though she's sorry for the roommate's problem, it's not her responsibility and that the roommate should buy her own food since her parents support her. The user feels that the roommate should be able to control herself, similar to restraint in public places like restaurants or stores.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nLet me break this down. The user is dealing with a roommate who has a serious eating disorder. The roommate is taking the user's food, which is a form of property. The user confronts the issue, which seems reasonable because having someone take your belongings without permission is a problem. The user's reaction is that it's not their problem and that the roommate needs to control herself. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's seeking help but hasn't received it yet.\n\nThe user is in a tricky situation. On one hand, the roommate has a mental health issue that's affecting her behavior. On the other hand, the user's property is being taken without consent. The user is on a budget and cooking to save money, so the food is a significant part of their expenses. \n\nIs the user in the wrong for setting boundaries? The user didn't confront the roommate harshly; they tried to be understanding but also set a limit. The user's argument is that the roommate can control herself in other situations (like not taking food from stores or restaurants) but isn't doing so in the apartment. The user is asking the roommate to respect their property, which is a reasonable expectation in a shared living space.\n\nHowever, maybe the user could have handled it differently. Instead of cutting off communication, perhaps offering support or suggesting alternative solutions, like buying the roommate food with their own money (if possible) or encouraging professional help. But the user's main point is that the roommate should take responsibility for her actions. \n\nThe user's frustration is valid because their property is being taken without permission. The roommate's issue is a health problem, but it doesn't excuse the behavior of taking another's food. The user's response, while perhaps harsh, is about setting boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social norms, roommates are expected to respect each other's belongings. The user isn't blaming the roommate's mental health but is holding her accountable for her actions. The user also acknowledges the roommate's issue but doesn't want to bear the financial burden of her disorder. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their own interests and setting boundaries, which is necessary in any living arrangement. The roommate's actions are problematic regardless of the underlying issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
