We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate who has bulimia and takes the author's food without asking. The author confronts her, and the roommate breaks down, explaining her condition. The author then tells her it's not their problem and that she should buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is a serious disorder. The author is upset because their food is being taken without permission. The roommate is replacing the food, but the author finds it unacceptable. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal property. Even if someone has a mental health issue, taking someone else's belongings without permission is generally considered wrong. The author has every right to feel that their property is being violated. However, the roommate's condition might affect her self-control. \n\nThe author's response was to confront her and set boundaries, which is reasonable. But did they go too far? The author acknowledges the roommate's issue but also asserts that it's not their responsibility. The roommate's parents supporting her financially might be a factor here. However, the author is on a budget and cooks to save money, so their stance makes sense.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of empathy. The roommate was clearly emotional and in distress. The author's approach was firm, which is understandable, but maybe they could have been more compassionate. However, the roommate's actions (taking food without consent) are still wrong regardless of her condition. \n\nSo, is the author the asshole? They are standing up for their own property and setting boundaries, which is not wrong. The roommate's excuse is personal and doesn't justify taking others' food. The author is not in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
