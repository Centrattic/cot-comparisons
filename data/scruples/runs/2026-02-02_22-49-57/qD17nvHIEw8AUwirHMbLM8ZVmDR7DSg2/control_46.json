We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate who has bulimia and is taking the author's food. The author confronts her, and the roommate is upset. The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is a serious condition. The author is cooking a lot of food and on a budget, so food is important to them. The roommate is taking the author's food, replacing it with different items, which is confusing and makes the author uncomfortable. The author confronts the roommate, who breaks down and explains her condition. The author then tells her it's not their problem and that she should buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the author has a right to their property and the situation is affecting their budget. It's understandable that they would be upset about their food being taken without permission. On the other hand, the roommate has a mental health issue and might not be able to control her impulses. The author's response was to tell her to buy her own food, which might come off as dismissive of the roommate's struggles. However, it's also valid for the author to set boundaries, especially since they're both adults and the roommate is in a position to receive support from her parents.\n\nI should consider if the author's expectations are reasonable. At 20, it's fair to expect someone to manage their own food, especially if they have a condition that leads to binge eating. The author isn't preventing the roommate from getting help or accessing food; they're just asking her to respect their property. The roommate's response of crying and not speaking to the author might indicate that the confrontation was harsh, but the author's frustration is justified given the situation.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the roommate replacing the food with different items, which could be a problem if it's causing confusion or affecting the author's meals. The author's point about not taking others' property in public places is valid, but the roommate is doing it in their shared home, which complicates things. It's a private space, so maybe the author is within their rights to expect that the roommate respects their belongings there.\n\nHowever, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy. Instead of telling the roommate it's not their problem, maybe they could have discussed practical solutions, like setting up separate storage or planning meals together. But the author's main point is about respecting ownership and boundaries, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their food and the situation was affecting their budget and comfort. Setting boundaries is important, and the roommate's condition doesn't absolve her of responsibility to respect those boundaries. The author's frustration is valid, even if the approach could have been more compassionate. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
