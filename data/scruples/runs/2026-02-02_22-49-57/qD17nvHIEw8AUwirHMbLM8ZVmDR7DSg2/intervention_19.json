We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The roommate has a mental health issue, specifically bulimia, which is affecting her behavior. The author found out that the roommate is taking their food, replacing it with different products, and now they've confronted her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The roommate has a known eating disorder, which is a serious medical condition. Bulimia can involve cycles of bingeing and purging, and those with the condition often struggle with control over their eating behaviors. The roommate's actions are related to her illness, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe author is living in a shared space and has a budget, so they cook multiple meals a day. The roommate isn't cooking and relies on taking the author's food, even though she replaces it. The author is upset about the invasion of privacy and the fact that someone is taking their belongings without permission. They confronted the roommate, who then broke down crying and explained her condition. The author then told the roommate that she should control herself and that she could buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their property and privacy. Taking someone's food without permission is not acceptable, regardless of the reason. The author's frustration is valid because they're being affected by someone else's actions. On the other hand, the roommate has a mental health issue that impairs her ability to control her behavior. The author might not be fully considering the complexity of the situation, such as the roommate's inability to seek immediate treatment due to being on a waitlist.\n\nBut the author's main issue is about personal property and the lack of respect for boundaries. While the roommate's condition is a factor, the act of taking food without consent is a breach of trust and privacy. The author's response was firm, but they did express some empathy by acknowledging the roommate's condition. However, the author's comment about the roommate's parents might come off as dismissive, as it could imply that the roommate should be able to afford her own food, which might not be the case. The roommate's financial situation is mentioned as being supported by her parents, but that doesn't mean she can choose to take the author's property. \n\nThe key here is balancing empathy for the roommate's mental health with the author's right to their belongings. The author's actions were about setting a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the way they communicated it might not have been the most supportive, especially given the roommate's condition. Confronting someone with a mental health issue in a harsh manner can exacerbate their symptoms. The author might have been better off suggesting alternative solutions, like helping the roommate find immediate resources or support, rather than just telling her to control herself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for their own property, but their approach could have been more compassionate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their approach was perfect. Since the act of taking someone's food without permission is wrong regardless of the reason, the author has a valid point. The roommate's condition doesn't excuse the behavior, though it does complicate the situation. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that empathy and support could have been incorporated better.\n"
