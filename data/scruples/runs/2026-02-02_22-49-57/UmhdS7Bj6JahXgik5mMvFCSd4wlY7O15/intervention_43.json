We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he must get therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend reacting with anger by throwing a cup of tea at her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, and the author didn't take it too seriously, thinking it was typical teenage behavior. But when he actually acted out, she confronted him. The key point is that the boyfriend's action\u2014throwing a drink in her face\u2014could be a sign of a deeper issue, even if it was a reaction rather than a premeditated act.\n\nThe author set a boundary. Setting boundaries is generally healthy in relationships. She made it clear that if he didn't seek help for his anger, she would end the relationship. Is that too pushy? Well, she's taking responsibility for her own safety and emotional well-being. In relationships, both parties should be willing to address red flags, especially when it comes to potential abuse or harmful behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend apologized and promised to get help. That's a positive sign, but the author is right to take the situation seriously. Anger issues can escalate, and therapy is a reasonable step. The author isn't just being controlling; she's addressing a significant issue that could affect the future of their relationship.\n\nSome might argue that she's being too hasty, given that they've only been together a month and a half. But considering the boyfriend's own admission about anger and the immediate reaction, her decision makes sense. It's better to address problems early rather than let them fester.\n\nAlso, the author is in a vulnerable position, being 18 and dealing with a 19-year-old's behavior. She's making a choice that prioritizes her own safety and the health of the relationship, which is a mature move. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her well-being and setting clear expectations. The answer should be B.\n"
