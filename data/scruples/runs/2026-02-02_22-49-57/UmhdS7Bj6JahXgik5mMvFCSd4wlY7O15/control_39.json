We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for setting a boundary with her boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend reacting with a physical outburst\u2014throwing a tea cup\u2014after a minor provocation. The author then demands he get therapy or she leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, so the author wasn't entirely unaware. However, the incident escalated quickly. Throwing a cup of iced tea isn't physical violence, but it's a clear act of aggression. The author's response was to set a firm boundary, which she followed through on. \n\nNow, considering the ethics of this. Setting boundaries in relationships is generally healthy. The author is protecting her own emotional and physical well-being. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and harmful, so the author's demand for therapy is a reasonable response. The question is whether she was too pushy. But given the context\u2014his prior warning about anger issues, and the immediate, physical reaction\u2014it's not unreasonable to expect him to seek help. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't give him a choice, but she's also the one who experienced the aggression. It's her right to decide her limits. The boyfriend's apology and promise to get help were voluntary, so she's not forcing him; she's making her conditions clear. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the reaction was over the top because it's a minor incident. But the fact that he admitted regret and apologized suggests he recognizes the wrongdoing. The author's stance is about preventing future harm. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author addressed the issue directly and set a boundary. That's proactive rather than passive. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and well-being. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
