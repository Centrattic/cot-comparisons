We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend, who's 19, throwing a cup of tea at her after she tapped his leg. The author is 18, and they've been dating about a month and a half.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the boyfriend's action was abusive. Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's cold, can be considered a form of violence, especially if it causes harm. The author mentions it got everywhere and initially hurt a bit. So, even though it wasn't a physical attack like hitting, it's an aggressive act that could escalate.\n\nThe boyfriend admitted he had anger issues and said he reacted without thinking. He apologized multiple times and promised to get help. The author, after the incident, set a boundary: therapy or she's leaving. She's standing her ground, which is important for her safety.\n\nNow, considering their ages, both are teenagers. Emotional maturity can vary, but the author is taking responsibility for her own well-being. Setting clear boundaries in a relationship is healthy. The boyfriend needs to address his anger issues, which the author is pushing for. \n\nIs the author being too pushy? Well, she's not forcing him but giving him a choice. If he's committed to change, he should take the initiative. Her stance is about her own safety and comfort in the relationship. It's reasonable to expect someone to seek help if their behavior is harmful.\n\nThe red flags here are the sudden aggressive act and his admission of anger issues. The author isn't ignoring these; she's addressing them directly. She's also considering that it was a one-time incident but is setting a boundary to prevent future issues. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have given him a chance to change without therapy, or that she's overreacting. But given the immediate harm and the potential for escalation, her reaction is justified. Therapy is a proactive step, not an attack on him personally.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her safety and the health of the relationship by addressing a serious issue early on. Her approach sets a boundary which is necessary when someone's behavior is harmful.\n"
