We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she's leaving. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the boyfriend had an angry reaction where he threw a cup of tea at her. The author was aware of his anger issues beforehand but didn't see red flags. Now, after this incident, she's setting a boundary that he must get help or she leaves. \n\nSo, the key points here are consent, health, and safety. Anger issues can be a sign of deeper problems. By setting this boundary, the author is prioritizing her safety and mental well-being. She's not just reacting impulsively; she's acknowledging his problem and giving a clear expectation for change. \n\nThe boyfriend apologized and promised to get help. The author is holding him accountable, which is important. In relationships, setting boundaries is healthy. Especially when there's a history of anger or potential for abuse, it's wise to take it seriously. \n\nSome might argue she's too pushy, but considering the action taken (throwing a liquid on her), it's a valid concern. Therapy is a constructive step, not a demand out of nowhere. She's not being inconsiderate; she's making a decision based on her own safety and the relationship's health. \n\nNo red flags were mentioned before, but this incident is a significant one. The author isn't wrong for leaving the situation as toxic if it doesn't improve. Her approach is firm but necessary given the circumstances.\n"
