We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making her boyfriend get therapy or leave after he threw iced tea at her. \n\nFirst, the context: They're both teenagers, been dating a month and a half. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, but she didn't take it seriously because she had her own past issues. The incident was a cup of iced tea thrown after a foot tap. She left, and then set a condition for staying.\n\nShe's wondering if she was too pushy. The key points are her setting a boundary for his behavior, specifically addressing his anger management. She wants him to get therapy, which is a reasonable request when there's a pattern of harmful behavior. Even if the act wasn't violent, it was a clear reaction that caused emotional distress and physical discomfort (getting tea in her face). \n\nSince he admitted to reacting without control and apologized, her setting a boundary shows she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. At 18, she's making a mature decision to protect herself. Therapy is a constructive step, not an unreasonable demand. The alternative of staying without addressing it could lead to worse issues. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was immediate but regretful. She's not being controlling; she's addressing a red flag. The answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her own needs and future.\n"
