We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend throwing iced tea on her after she tapped him playfully, then she told him he needed therapy or else she'd leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend has mentioned his anger issues before, but the author didn't take it seriously because she had anger issues too. Then, he reacted violently by throwing a drink. The author set a boundary: therapy or break up. Now, the question is if she's wrong for doing that.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. The author felt violated by the physical act of being thrown with a drink, even if it was cold. She's holding him accountable for his actions, which is reasonable. The boyfriend admitted he reacted impulsively and apologized.\n\nBut maybe someone could argue that she was too quick to demand therapy. However, given the context\u2014his prior mention of anger issues and her own history\u2014she's justifiably cautious. The act of throwing a drink could be seen as aggressive behavior, even if unintended. So pushing for professional help is a reasonable step to ensure safety.\n\nAnother angle: the relationship is new (a month and a half), so maybe she's making a hasty decision. But considering the immediate reaction and the importance of safety, it's valid. People have the right to set limits they're comfortable with. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and safety.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her boundaries based on his actions and prior warnings.\n"
