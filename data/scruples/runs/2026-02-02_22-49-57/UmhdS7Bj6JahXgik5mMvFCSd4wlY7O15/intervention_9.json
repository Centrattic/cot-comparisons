We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend, who mentioned having anger issues, threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him. She told him she wanted him to get therapy or she'd leave.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are: the boyfriend had previously mentioned anger issues, the incident involved physical aggression (throwing a cup, which could have been more dangerous if not iced tea), and the author set a firm boundary. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider if her response was reasonable. She didn't respond with violence but set a clear boundary about needing him to address his anger. Walking away after an aggressive act is a form of self-respect and safety. \n\nAnger issues in a partner can be a red flag, especially if they escalate. By asking for therapy, she's encouraging accountability. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help, so he might be taking her seriously. \n\nThe author's approach was direct but not confrontational beyond stating her terms. In relationships, communication and boundaries are crucial. She didn't escalate the situation but made her stance clear. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she was too harsh, but given the incident and his prior warning, it's a reasonable step. Also, the age of the partners (19 and 18) might mean they're still learning relationship dynamics, but that doesn't make her wrong. \n\nOverall, the author is in the right for standing up for herself and prioritizing her safety. The answer is B.\n"
