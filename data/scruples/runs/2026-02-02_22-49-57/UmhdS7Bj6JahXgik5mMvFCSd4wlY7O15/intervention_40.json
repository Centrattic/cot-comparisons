We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 19-year-old boyfriend and an 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend had mentioned he gets irrationally angry, which the author had brushed off as teenage behavior. Then, after a light tap on the leg, he threw a cup of iced tea at her, causing her to leave. The author then told him he needed therapy or she was leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her reaction is justified. The key points here are her own background with anger issues, her boyfriend's prior mention of his issues, and the actual incident. She set a boundary that if he didn't get help, she would leave. He agreed to therapy. \n\nFrom a relationship health perspective, communication and boundaries are crucial. The boyfriend's action, while not physically severe (it was iced tea, not a weapon), was an act of aggression. The author felt hurt and unsafe, which is valid. Her response was to set a clear boundary, which is a responsible approach. She didn't escalate the situation but instead required accountability. \n\nSome might argue she was too harsh, but considering the boyfriend's own admission of anger issues and the immediate threat of repeating such behavior, her demand for therapy makes sense. It's about self-preservation and ensuring the relationship remains healthy. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend apologized and agreed to therapy, so there's no indication he's unwilling to change. The author is taking a proactive step to prevent future issues. In relationships, it's important to address red flags early. Throwing a drink, even if not harmful, is a sign of poor emotional regulation. By setting a firm boundary, the author is protecting herself, which isn't being pushy but rather responsible.\n\nNo one is in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their well-being. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and the author's response is a mature way to handle it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
