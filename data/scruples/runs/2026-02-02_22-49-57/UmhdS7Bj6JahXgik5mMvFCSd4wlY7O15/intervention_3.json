We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, an 18-year-old girl, is in a one-and-a-half-month relationship with her 19-year-old boyfriend. He mentioned having anger issues before, and she didn't take it too seriously, thinking it was just teenage behavior. Then, during a walk, she playfully taps him, and he reacts by throwing an iced tea cup at her face. This clearly upsets her, and she leaves, telling him he needs to get therapy or she's gone for good.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if I agree. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider the key points. The boyfriend had a history of anger issues, which he mentioned. The author didn't ignore it entirely but maybe downplayed it. When the incident happened, he acted impulsively in a way that caused harm (even if minor, as it was iced tea). The author then set a clear boundary: therapy or break up. \n\nIs setting such a boundary too harsh? Well, in a healthy relationship, communication and addressing issues are important. The author felt uncomfortable after the incident and decided to take a firm stance. She didn't lash out or retaliate; she left and set a condition. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author was too quick to demand therapy without giving him a chance to improve. But given that it was a direct act of aggression, even if it was a cup of tea, it's a clear boundary crossed. Also, considering their ages, they're both teenagers, which can add context\u2014emotional regulation is still developing. However, the key point is that the author is standing up for herself and prioritizing her safety and well-being. \n\nIn many similar situations, advocating for one's safety and setting boundaries is seen as the right thing to do. The author isn't being aggressive; she's being assertive. The boyfriend's action was unprovoked and harmful, so her response is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
