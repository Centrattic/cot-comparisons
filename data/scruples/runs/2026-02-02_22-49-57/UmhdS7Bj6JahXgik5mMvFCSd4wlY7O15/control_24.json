We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend throwing a cup of tea at her after a minor incident. The author then sets a boundary requiring him to get therapy or she leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup, even if it was iced tea, could be seen as an aggressive act. The author mentions he has a history of irrational anger, so she might have been aware of the potential for this. But the key here is how she handled it. She set a clear boundary which is important in relationships, especially when there's a pattern of behavior that could be harmful.\n\nThe boyfriend apologized, said he regretted it, and agreed to get help. The author's response was to make it a non-negotiable condition. Some might say she's being too harsh, but in relationships, especially when safety is a concern, setting boundaries is crucial. Therapy is a reasonable request for someone with anger issues. \n\nBut wait, is it too much for a one-time incident? The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, so this might be a recurring problem. The author might be acting preemptively to avoid future issues. On the other hand, some might argue that a single incident doesn't necessarily warrant ending the relationship or demanding therapy, especially if both parties are young and still learning.\n\nBut the author didn't end the relationship immediately; she gave him a chance to commit to getting help. That shows she's willing to work on it but has a clear line she won't cross. It's about self-respect and safety. If she feels that his actions are unacceptable, she has the right to set that boundary. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her own well-being and addressing a known issue he's had. The answer should be B.\n"
