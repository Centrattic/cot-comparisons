We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend that he either gets therapy or she leaves. The situation is that the boyfriend threw an iced tea cup at her after she tapped him, which was an impulsive reaction. The girl set a boundary, and the boyfriend agreed to get help.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the boyfriend has a history of mentioning his anger issues, which the girl acknowledged but perhaps didn't take as seriously until this incident. The act of throwing the cup was an impulsive, aggressive reaction to a minor provocation (a foot tap). The girl felt upset and set a clear boundary, which is that he must seek therapy or she would leave. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help.\n\nNow, considering domestic violence and healthy relationship standards, even minor aggressive acts can be red flags, especially if there's a history of anger issues. The girl's decision to set a boundary is a responsible action. She's protecting herself and acknowledging that his behavior, while not physically severe, is concerning and needs professional intervention.\n\nIs the girl being too pushy? Well, in a relationship, it's important to communicate boundaries. When someone's actions threaten the safety or emotional well-being of the partner, setting such boundaries is necessary. The girl isn't being unreasonable; she's prioritizing her safety and the health of the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (apologizing and agreeing to therapy) suggests he recognized the severity of his actions.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say she overreacted, but the key here is that the boyfriend's action was an unprovoked aggressive act, even if it was with a plastic cup. The girl's response is proactive in addressing potential future issues. Also, considering the boyfriend's age (19) and the girl's (18), they're both young and learning about relationships, but that doesn't mean the girl is wrong in standing her ground.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. The boyfriend is responsible for his actions and the need for therapy. The girl is responsible for her safety and making decisions that protect her well-being. She's not the one acting out in anger; she's responding with clear communication and setting firm limits.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions are justified as she's addressing a behavior that could escalate and is seeking a healthy resolution through professional help.\n"
