We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about a boyfriend who reacted with anger by throwing a cup of tea at her. The author told him he needs to get therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what happened. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, so the author wasn't completely blindsided. When the incident happened, he reacted impulsively, which he later apologized for. The author then set a boundary that either he gets help or she leaves. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is usually seen as healthy. If someone has known issues, like anger management, and you feel it's necessary for them to seek help to prevent future harm, that's a valid concern. The boyfriend's action was physically aggressive, even if it was with a cold drink. The author's response was to clearly state her expectations, which is not unreasonable. \n\nBut some might argue that her response is too harsh, especially since they're young and maybe he's trying to change. However, safety is a primary concern. If someone acts out with violence, even if it's a one-time incident, it's important to address it. The author isn't being pushy; she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. There's no indication she's being controlling here. She's given him a chance to grow and improve. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a better way to approach it, like suggesting therapy without ultimatums. But given the situation, her actions are justified. The key point is that she's standing up for herself after being physically harmed, even if it was accidental. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
