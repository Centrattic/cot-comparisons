We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs to get therapy or she'll leave. So, the situation is that they're both teenagers, 18 and 19, in a short-term relationship. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues before, and the author didn't take it seriously because she thought it was just teenage behavior.\n\nThen, the incident happens where he throws a cup of iced tea at her after she jabs him with her foot. She's upset, leaves, and later tells him he needs to get help or she's leaving. The key points here are: he had a history of mentioning anger issues, he acted impulsively in the moment, and she set a boundary for his future behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if her reaction is justified. She acknowledged his history, and after an incident that caused her physical harm (even if minor), she's setting a clear boundary. Setting boundaries in relationships is generally healthy, especially when there's a history of the issue. The fact that he apologized and agreed to get help suggests he took her words seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she's being too harsh because it was a minor incident. But the fact that he had prior warnings about his anger and then acted on it impulsively is a red flag. She's not just reacting to this one incident but addressing a recurring issue he's mentioned. Also, she's taking responsibility by saying she'll leave if it continues, which is a valid way to protect herself.\n\nAnother angle is that as teenagers, they might not handle conflicts maturely, but the author is addressing a potential pattern before it escalates. The key here is that the author isn't giving an ultimatum out of nowhere but in response to a specific incident that's part of a known issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting a necessary boundary for her own well-being and safety. The answer should be B.\n"
