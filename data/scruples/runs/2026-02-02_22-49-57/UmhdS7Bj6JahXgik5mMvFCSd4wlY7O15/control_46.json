We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend lashing out by throwing a tea cup at her, and her responding by setting a boundary that he must get therapy or she leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend has mentioned anger issues before, and the author thought it was typical teenage behavior. Then, he reacted impulsively by throwing the cup, causing her distress. She then told him he needs therapy or she's leaving. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being so firm.\n\nLooking at the factors: He had prior warnings about anger, but the action was still unexpected. She set a boundary after an incident that hurt her. In relationships, communication and boundaries are important. Setting a clear boundary because of safety or comfort is usually considered reasonable. Therapy as a solution is a constructive step. She's prioritizing her well-being and his improvement. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she's being too harsh because he apologized and promised to change. But considering the potential for future incidents if his anger isn't addressed, her stance makes sense. Abuse in any form, even non-physical, can be a red flag. Her reaction is proactive to prevent further issues.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her safety and the relationship's health. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
