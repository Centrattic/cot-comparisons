We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a detailed account of a situation where the boyfriend threw his tea at her, and she told him he needed to get therapy or she'd leave. The main question is whether her response was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for a month and a half. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, and the author had some history with anger herself, so she might have been more empathetic. The incident happened when she tapped him playfully, and he reacted by throwing his tea. That seems like an overreaction, especially since the trigger was a minor action. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's immediate reaction and the author's response. The boyfriend's action of throwing the tea cup could be seen as a physical aggression, even if it didn't cause serious harm. The author was upset, left the situation, and then set a boundary by requiring therapy. \n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, setting boundaries around abusive behavior is generally considered healthy. Anger management issues, especially if they result in physical actions like this, are red flags. The author isn't just reacting to a single incident but a pattern the boyfriend mentioned he had. By asking him to seek therapy, she's addressing the root issue rather than just the incident. \n\nNow, could she have handled it differently? Maybe, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the boyfriend admitted to regretting the action and apologized, the author's stance is about future prevention. She's not being pushy if she's protecting herself from potential future harm. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she's being too harsh given the short time they've been together. But considering the boyfriend's own admission of anger issues and the immediate physical reaction, her decision seems reasonable. Therapy is a common recommendation for such issues, and she's holding him accountable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her safety and the health of the relationship. Answer B.\n"
