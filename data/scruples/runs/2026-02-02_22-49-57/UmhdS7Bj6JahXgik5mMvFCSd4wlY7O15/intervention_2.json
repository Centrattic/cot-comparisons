We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. \n\nFirst, the context: The boyfriend, who's 19, mentioned his anger issues before. The author, 18, didn't think much of it, thinking it was just typical teenage behavior. Then, during a walk, after a light tap on the leg, he threw his iced tea cup at her. It was a sudden, unprovoked act that caused her physical discomfort and emotional distress. \n\nShe decided to set a boundary, requiring therapy for his anger or she would end the relationship. The key here is that she's setting a boundary for her own safety and well-being. She's not being pushy; she's prioritizing her needs after experiencing a clear escalation in his behavior. \n\nNow, considering the options. Option A says she's in the wrong. But that doesn't seem right. She's reacting to an act that was harmful, even if it wasn't violent. The boyfriend admitted he regretted it and agreed to therapy. Her stance is about self-respect and safety, which are valid. \n\nOption B says she's not in the wrong. That fits better. She's taking responsibility for her boundaries, which is healthy, especially in a relationship. It's important to address red flags early, and she's doing that. There's no evidence she's being unreasonable. The boyfriend's actions, while perhaps not violent, were disrespectful and uncontrolled. \n\nSo, the answer should be B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
