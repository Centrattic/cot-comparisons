We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. Let's start with the facts.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 19, she's 18. They've been together for a month and a half. He mentioned his anger issues before, which she thought were just typical teenage stuff. Then, he threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. She left, and she told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nNow, the key points here: The boyfriend has a history of anger issues, which he admitted to. The incident was a physical reaction, even if it was with a plastic cup. The author felt hurt and left because of the action. She's setting a boundary for his behavior.\n\nIn relationships, especially where there are red flags like anger issues, communication is key. The author didn't confront him with anger but set a clear boundary after the incident. She gave him a choice, which is a way to enforce her limits. Since he had mentioned the problem before, she's addressing it now when it escalated.\n\nIs she being too pushy? Well, when someone's safety is at risk, even if it's not a severe case, it's reasonable to set a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and physical, which is a red flag. The author is prioritizing her well-being by demanding accountability. Therapy is a common and reasonable step to address anger management.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a proactive step to protect herself in a relationship where there's an existing issue. The boyfriend's actions, not the author's response, are the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
