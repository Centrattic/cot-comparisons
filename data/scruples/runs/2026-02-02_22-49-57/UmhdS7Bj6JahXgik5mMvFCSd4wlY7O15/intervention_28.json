We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The context is that the boyfriend (19) and the author (18) have been dating for 1.5 months. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues, but the author didn't take it seriously at first. Then, he threw a cup of iced tea in her face after she tapped his leg. The author was angry, left, and told him he either gets therapy or she leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was appropriate. The key points here are the boyfriend's reaction and the author's decision. Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's cold, is an act of aggression, even if not physically harmful. The author felt violated and unsafe after this incident. She set a boundary, which is his getting therapy or her leaving. \n\nIn relationships, especially when there are signs of potential abuse or controlling behavior, setting firm boundaries is crucial. The author didn't escalate the situation with violence; she took a stand for her safety and well-being. The boyfriend admitted fault and apologized, showing some accountability. \n\nBut wait, is the author being too pushy? Maybe, but considering the act was a clear boundary violation, her response is justified. Therapy is a reasonable request for someone with anger management issues. The question is whether her approach was too harsh. However, given that the incident could be a red flag for future aggressive behavior, her decision to insist on therapy is proactive. \n\nAlso, both are teenagers, which might mean they're still learning how to handle relationships and conflicts. The author is prioritizing her safety, which is essential. The boyfriend's reaction was immediate and regretful, but the action itself is concerning. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong. She recognized a red flag, communicated her needs clearly, and took action to protect herself. The answer should be B.\n"
