We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or leave. The situation is that the boyfriend threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him playfully. He later apologized and said he didn't mean to react like that. The author set a boundary that he must get help or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues before, and the author was aware of that. She didn't take it too seriously initially, thinking it was typical teenage behavior. However, this incident escalated quickly. Throwing a cup of tea in someone's face, even if it's iced, is a physical aggression. The author felt hurt and angry, leading her to set a firm boundary.\n\nSetting boundaries in relationships is important. The author is prioritizing her safety and well-being by holding her ground. She's not just reacting out of anger but making a decision based on past warnings and the immediate incident. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014promising to get help\u2014shows that he understood the severity of his actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is being too pushy. In relationships, especially with known issues like anger problems, setting firm boundaries is necessary. The author didn't attack him personally; she stated her needs clearly. She's giving him a chance to address the problem, which is a reasonable approach. \n\nSome might argue that she should have given him more time or tried other methods first, but considering the potential for repeated incidents and the fact that he already had a history of mentioning anger issues, her decision seems justified. The alternative\u2014staying in a possibly unsafe situation\u2014would be more harmful.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She's acting in self-preservation and addressing a red flag that was previously mentioned. Her approach is firm but fair, giving the boyfriend a clear path to improve. Answer B.\n"
