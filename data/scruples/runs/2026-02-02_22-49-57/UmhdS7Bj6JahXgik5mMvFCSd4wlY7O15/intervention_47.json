We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves an incident where the boyfriend reacted with anger by throwing a cup of tea at her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They've been together a month and a half, both teenagers. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, which the author initially dismissed as teenage behavior. But this time, the reaction was physical\u2014throwing a cup in her face. That's a clear boundary violation.\n\nThe author's response was to set a firm boundary: therapy or she leaves. She's holding him accountable for his actions, which is a reasonable step when someone's behavior threatens the relationship's health. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help, which suggests he acknowledged his mistake.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's being too pushy. In relationships, communication about red flags is crucial. Anger issues, especially when they lead to physical aggression, are significant. By setting a clear ultimatum, the author is prioritizing her safety and emotional well-being. It's not unreasonable for her to require professional help if there's a recurring issue.\n\nBut wait, is it fair for a month-old relationship to have such a strict ultimatum? Some might argue that she's being too quick to judge, but given the specific mention of anger issues and the immediate violent reaction, it's a valid concern. She didn't react immediately; she waited after the incident to address it. Also, she's 18, so while still young, she's capable of making such decisions.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's reaction. He said he didn't register the anger at first, which could mean he acted impulsively. But the fact remains that he threw something at her. The author's response is about preventing future incidents. Therapy is a common and necessary step for anger management.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe suggesting therapy without an ultimatum, but the author made it clear that if it happened again, she'd leave. That's a balance between giving him a chance and protecting herself. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and setting boundaries. The boyfriend's actions required a strong response to address the underlying issue.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's addressing a red flag appropriately, and her ultimatum is a reasonable way to ensure the relationship remains healthy.\n"
