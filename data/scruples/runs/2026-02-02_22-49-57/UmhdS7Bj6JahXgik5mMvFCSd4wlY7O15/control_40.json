We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend reacting angrily by throwing a cup of tea at her, and she responded by setting a boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's actions. He had mentioned anger issues before, and now this incident is an example of that. Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's iced, is a physical act of aggression. It's not just a minor prank; it's a violent reaction to a light tap. That's a red flag for potential abuse, especially since he said he didn't register the anger initially but reacted. The girl felt hurt and unsafe, which is reasonable.\n\nNow, the girl's response. She set a clear boundary: therapy or the relationship ends. She's 18, and he's 19, both teenagers. Their relationship is only a month and a half old. She's standing up for herself, which is important. In relationships, especially when there are signs of potential abuse, setting firm boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to therapy, so he might not see it the same way. But the girl's approach was direct. Is that too pushy? Well, considering the context\u2014past mention of anger issues and now an actual aggressive act\u2014her reaction is justified. She's protecting herself from potential further harm. \n\nSome might say she's being too quick to end it, but given the risk of escalating violence, pushing for professional help is a responsible step. The alternative is to ignore the red flag and risk a more severe incident later. So, she's not wrong for prioritizing her safety. \n\nThe options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Based on this analysis, the answer should be B. The author is not in the wrong because she's addressing a serious issue with appropriate boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are the main problem here, and her response is a valid self-defense measure in a relationship context.\n"
