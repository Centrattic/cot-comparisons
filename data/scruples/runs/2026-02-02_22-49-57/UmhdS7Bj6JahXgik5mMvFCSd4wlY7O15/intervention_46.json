We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. \n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend threw a cup of tea at her, which happened because he reacted angrily to her tapping him. He admitted he didn't even know he was mad at first but just reacted. The author is 18, he's 19, and they've been together a month and a half. She's setting a boundary that he must get help or she leaves.\n\nI think about boundaries in relationships. If someone does something that makes you feel unsafe or disrespected, it's okay to set a boundary. The author recognized his anger issues and took action. He has a history of mentioning his anger, so she's addressing a known issue. \n\nBut wait, some might say she's overreacting because it was a plastic cup of tea. But the act of throwing it in her face is aggressive and could be seen as a form of physical aggression, even if it didn't cause serious harm. The fact that he apologized and said he regretted it immediately might show he didn't mean to hurt her, but the fact remains that it happened.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a new relationship and isn't experienced. She might not know how to handle it better, but she's trying to protect herself. Setting a firm boundary is a responsible action. Some people might argue that she should give him more chances, but given his own admission about anger issues, it's a valid concern.\n\nAlso, considering the ages, they're teenagers. But teenagers can still be held accountable for their actions. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and well-being. So I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
