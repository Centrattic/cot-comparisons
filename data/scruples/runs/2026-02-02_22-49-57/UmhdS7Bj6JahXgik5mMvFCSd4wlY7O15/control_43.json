We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a girl in a new relationship with her 19-year-old boyfriend. They've been together a month and a half. She mentions that he had mentioned his anger issues before, but she didn't take it seriously, thinking maybe it's just typical teenage behavior. Then, during a walk, she taps him on the leg, and he reacts by throwing iced tea on her face. She gets upset and leaves, telling him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, let's consider her actions. She set a clear boundary after he acted out. He apologized, and she made her stance that he needed professional help. She's taking responsibility for her own feelings and safety. Is that reasonable? Well, when someone's behavior becomes abusive or harmful, it's important to address it. Throwing a drink in someone's face is a form of physical aggression, even if it's not severe. She's not just reacting to one instance but setting a precedent for future behavior. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's side: He claims to have reacted impulsively and apologized. But the key here is that he had mentioned his anger issues before. The author says she accepted that but now sees that it could escalate. By setting a firm boundary, she's trying to prevent potential future harm. \n\nIs she being too pushy? Well, in a relationship, both partners have the right to express their needs and boundaries. If someone's behavior is harmful, it's reasonable to ask for them to seek help. The author is not forcing him, but giving a clear choice between therapy or the end of the relationship. That's a common approach when boundaries are crossed. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Some might say she's overreacting because it was a one-time incident. But considering his prior mention of anger issues, this could be a sign of a pattern that needs addressing. Others might argue that he had apologized and she should give him more time, but she's not giving him a second chance without accountability. \n\nAnother angle: At 18, she's young and might be inexperienced in handling such situations. However, setting boundaries is crucial for a healthy relationship. Therapy is a legitimate recommendation for managing anger, so her demand isn't unreasonable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting herself by addressing a red flag and ensuring that her partner takes responsibility. Her approach is firm but reasonable given the context.\n"
