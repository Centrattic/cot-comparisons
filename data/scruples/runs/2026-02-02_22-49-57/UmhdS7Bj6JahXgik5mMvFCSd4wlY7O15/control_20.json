We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs to get therapy or she'll leave. The situation is that he threw iced tea at her after she tapped his leg, which he later apologized for. She set a boundary that he must get help for his anger issues, or she's out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's 18, he's 19. They've been together a month and a half. She acknowledges he mentioned anger issues before, but didn't think it was a red flag. Now, there's an incident where he reacted violently, even if it was with a plastic cup and iced tea. She's setting a boundary after this event.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask for therapy? Well, when someone has anger issues that lead to physical actions, even if minor, setting a boundary is important. The author is protecting herself. The act of throwing a cup could be seen as a form of physical aggression, even if not severe. She's right to take it seriously because it's a sign of potential escalation.\n\nBut maybe the boyfriend's reaction was a one-time thing, and she's overreacting? However, the key point is that she's setting a limit. In relationships, boundaries are crucial. If someone has a history of anger, even if they mention it themselves, it's important to address it. Therapy is a common and reasonable suggestion for managing anger issues.\n\nOn the other hand, could she have handled it differently? Maybe discussed it without an ultimatum? But she's in a vulnerable position and might not have the experience to handle it differently. She's also considering the potential for future issues. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help, so maybe the ultimatum was necessary to communicate her seriousness.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the author is advocating for her safety and setting clear boundaries, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions, even if accidental in reaction, are concerning. The author is taking responsibility for her own well-being, which is appropriate.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
