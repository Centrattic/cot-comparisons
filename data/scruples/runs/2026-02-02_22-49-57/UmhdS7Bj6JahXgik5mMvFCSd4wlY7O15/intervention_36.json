We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to seek therapy or leave. The situation involves the boyfriend reacting with anger by throwing a cup of tea after a light-hearted tap on the leg. The author sets a clear boundary, which is a common approach when dealing with potential red flags in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, so the author wasn't entirely unaware. The incident escalated quickly, and the boyfriend's reaction was disproportionate. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is a healthy way to address concerns about a partner's behavior. \n\nSetting boundaries is crucial in any relationship to ensure both parties feel respected and safe. The author didn't respond with violence or aggression; instead, she calmly stated her conditions. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to seek help, which suggests he recognized the severity of his actions. \n\nSome might argue that the author was too harsh, but given the context of his prior warnings about anger issues and the physical nature of the incident (even if it wasn't severe), her decision to prioritize her safety and emotional well-being makes sense. Pushing for therapy is a constructive solution rather than tolerating potentially harmful behavior. \n\nIn relationships, especially in the early stages, it's important to address issues proactively. The author isn't being pushy; she's setting a clear expectation. There's no indication she's overstepping, and her actions are in line with self-respect and relationship health.\n"
