We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend lashing out by throwing a cup of iced tea after a playful nudge. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, but the author didn't take it seriously at first, thinking it was just typical teenage behavior. Then, there's the incident where he reacts impulsively, which could be seen as a red flag. The author's response was to set a boundary, demanding he seek therapy or she'll end the relationship.\n\nI need to consider healthy relationship boundaries. In a relationship, it's important for both partners to feel safe and respected. The boyfriend's action, though not physically violent (since it was iced tea), was an act of aggression. The author's reaction is about protecting herself and addressing a serious issue he's already acknowledged. \n\nIs setting a boundary too pushy? Therapy is a common recommendation for anger management. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable here. She's given him a choice, which can be seen as firm but necessary, especially if she feels unsafe or that the behavior isn't acceptable. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend himself apologized and agreed to get help. That suggests he understood her stance and accepted it. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's taking his previous statements seriously once an incident occurs. \n\nI think the key points here are: the boyfriend had prior warning about his anger issues, the author set a clear boundary after an incident that made her uncomfortable, and he agreed to the solution. So the author isn't in the wrong. Her action is proactive and justified to maintain a healthy relationship.\n"
