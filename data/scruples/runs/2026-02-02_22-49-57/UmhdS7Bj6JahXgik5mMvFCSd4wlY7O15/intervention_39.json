We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or leave. The situation involves her boyfriend reacting with anger by throwing a cup of tea at her. She set a boundary and stuck to it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are teenagers, which can make relationships more volatile. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, but she didn't take it seriously until this incident. Throwing a cup of iced tea isn't a severe physical act, but it is an act of aggression. The key here is the reaction to the tapping on the leg, which escalated quickly.\n\nThe author's response was to set a firm boundary. She asked him to get therapy or she would leave. Setting clear boundaries in a relationship is generally healthy. She's not being pushy; she's addressing a red flag she previously overlooked. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help, so there's no immediate refusal. However, the user is wondering if her approach was too harsh.\n\nArguments against her being wrong: She's protecting herself from potential future harm. She's acknowledging his past comments about anger issues and taking them seriously now that there's an example. Her decision isn't impulsive but a response to a specific incident. She's not escalating the situation beyond the action taken.\n\nArguments that might suggest she's in the wrong: The incident itself was minor, and maybe she overreacted. Some might say that one act doesn't justify ending the relationship. Also, she's making him get therapy, which could be seen as controlling. However, considering his prior mention of anger issues, it's a reasonable precaution.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was immediate and regretful, so he's not in denial. The author isn't being abusive or aggressive; she's standing up for herself. In relationships, especially new ones, setting boundaries is crucial. The question is about whether her approach was too harsh, but given the context, it seems justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's taking a proactive step to ensure her safety and the health of the relationship. It's important to address potential issues early, and she's doing that without being overly vindictive.\n"
