We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who suddenly threw iced tea on her after she tapped him. The author then decided he must get therapy or she'd leave.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has mentioned before having anger issues, which the author didn't take as red flags because she had her own issues. But when this incident happened, she set a boundary. The question is whether her response was too harsh or justified.\n\nSo, the author's actions: she told him he needs therapy or she's leaving. That's a firm stance. But is it wrong? Well, in relationships, setting boundaries around abusive or harmful behavior is important. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup of tea is a physical act that caused harm, even if minor. The author was within her right to express her discomfort and set a boundary for future safety.\n\nThe boyfriend did apologize and agreed to get help, so maybe the author's approach was direct but necessary. People have the right to demand that their partners address harmful behaviors, especially when it comes to safety. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and taking a firm stance. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But wait, did she handle it too pushy? The story says she's new to this. But pushing someone towards therapy isn't being pushy; it's setting a boundary. So, yeah, B makes sense.\n"
