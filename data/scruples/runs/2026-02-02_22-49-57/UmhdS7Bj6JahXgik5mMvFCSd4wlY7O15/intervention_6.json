We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who threw iced tea on the author when she tapped him, and she told him he needs therapy or she's leaving. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend had previously mentioned anger issues, but the author didn't take it seriously initially. Then, after an incident where he reacted violently, she set a boundary. The key here is whether her response was appropriate.\n\nSetting boundaries in a relationship is generally healthy. If someone's behavior is making you uncomfortable or unsafe, it's important to address it. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup of tea, even if it was iced, is an aggressive reaction. The author felt hurt and decided that therapy is necessary. She gave him a choice: get help or leave. \n\nNow, considering the age of the couple (18 and 19), they're both young and might not have a lot of experience handling conflicts. However, the author's approach was direct but clear. She didn't attack him but set a boundary based on his previous warnings about his anger. \n\nIs she being too pushy? Arguably, when someone's safety is at risk, being firm is necessary. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help, so maybe the approach worked. However, some might argue that she could have been more patient or gave him another chance. But the fact that he had already mentioned his issues and this was a clear escalation might justify her stance.\n\nSo, the main question: is she in the wrong? Probably not. She took a stand for her safety and well-being. So the answer should be B.\n"
