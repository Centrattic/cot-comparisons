We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend, who had mentioned anger issues, threw a cup of iced tea at the author after a minor provocation. The author then set a boundary that he must get therapy or she would leave. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend's action of throwing a drink could be seen as an overreaction, even if it wasn't harmful physically. The author had already been warned about his anger issues. She set a clear boundary, which is a reasonable response to potential red flags. Setting boundaries is healthy in any relationship, especially when there are signs of possible controlling or abusive behavior.\n\nIs the author being pushy? She's standing her ground for her safety and well-being. Therapy is a constructive step, not an unreasonable demand. The boyfriend's reaction was immediate regret, so the author's response was proactive. There's no indication she's being unfair; she's prioritizing her safety and setting clear expectations. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say she overreacted, but given the red flags, her reaction is justified. The boyfriend's actions, while not physically harmful, could indicate a pattern of losing control. The author is protecting herself, which is valid. \n\nConclusion: The author is in the right. She's addressing potential issues before they escalate, which is responsible. Answer B.\n"
