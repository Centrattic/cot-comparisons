We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend threw iced tea on her after she tapped him. The key points are about anger issues and how she responded.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend had mentioned before that he gets irrationally angry. The author didn't take it too seriously, thinking it was just teenage behavior. But when the incident happened, it was a clear act of aggression, even if it didn't cause physical harm. The author felt hurt and angry, and she decided to set a boundary by making it a deal: therapy or she leaves.\n\nNow, considering her response: she told him he either gets help or she's gone. That's a firm stance, but is it too much? Well, in relationships, communication and boundaries are important. If someone acts in a way that's harmful, even if unintentional, it's reasonable to want them to address it. The author didn't respond with violence or aggression; she set a clear limit for her safety and well-being.\n\nThe boyfriend apologized and promised to get help. She gave him a chance to change, which shows she's not being unreasonable. She's taking responsibility for her own needs and safety. The question is whether her demand for therapy is too pushy. But given that the act was a sudden reaction to something minor (a tap on the leg), it's a valid concern. The author's approach seems like a healthy way to address a potential red flag early on.\n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her safety and making her boundaries clear, which is appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction was inappropriate, and her response is a reasonable step to ensure the relationship doesn't escalate.\n"
