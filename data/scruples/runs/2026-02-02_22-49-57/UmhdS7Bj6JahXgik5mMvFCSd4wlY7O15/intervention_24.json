We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves a young couple; the boyfriend threw iced tea at her after she tapped his leg. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before. The author didn't have red flags about abuse, just that he gets irrationally angry. Now, after an incident that caused physical harm (albeit minor), she sets a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are about setting healthy boundaries in a relationship. The author is taking a stand for her own safety and well-being. When someone acts in a way that's physically aggressive, even if it's accidental or impulsive, it's important to address it. Therapy is a reasonable step to address anger management, especially if the person is open to it, as the boyfriend was here.\n\nThe author isn't being pushy; she's communicating a non-negotiable boundary. It's reasonable to expect that if someone's behavior poses a risk of harm, they should seek help. The boyfriend's reaction (apologizing multiple times and promising therapy) suggests he recognizes the issue was serious.\n\nSome might argue that she's being too harsh, but considering the boyfriend's own admission of anger issues and the actual incident, her response is appropriate. She's not giving an ultimatum out of spite but out of self-preservation. In relationships, especially when there are existing red flags, enforcing boundaries is crucial.\n\nAlso, the age factor comes into play\u2014both are teenagers. While young, they're still responsible for their actions. The author is taking responsibility for her well-being by setting limits. Therapy is a proactive step, and her ultimatum ensures that the boyfriend takes it seriously.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's acting in her own interest and addressing a clear issue that the boyfriend himself acknowledged. The answer should be B.\n"
