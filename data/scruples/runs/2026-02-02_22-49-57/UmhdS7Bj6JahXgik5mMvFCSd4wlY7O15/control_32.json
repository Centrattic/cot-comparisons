We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the girl in the story) is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend threw iced tea on her in a fit of rage, and she told him he needs to get therapy or she's leaving. So, I need to figure out if her response was justified or not.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, but the author didn't take it seriously at first. Then, during a walk, the boyfriend reacts violently when she taps him, which leads to her confronting him. She demands he get therapy or she's leaving. The question is whether her reaction is too harsh.\n\nThe author is 18, and the boyfriend is 19. They've been together for about 1.5 months. He apologized and said he didn't mean to react that way. She's setting a boundary here, which is important. Setting boundaries in relationships is crucial for safety and respect. If someone acts out physically, even if it's a minor incident, it can be a red flag, especially if they have a history of anger issues.\n\nThe user might be thinking about the line between healthy boundaries and being too controlling. However, in this case, the author is not being controlling but rather protecting herself from potential future harm. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup of tea, while not a severe physical attack, is sudden and unexpected, which can cause emotional distress. The author is taking a stand to ensure her safety and his well-being by suggesting therapy.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author overreacted. But given that the boyfriend had warned her about his anger and then acted on it, her response is justified. It's important in relationships for both parties to address issues that could lead to harm. The author isn't being pushy; she's setting a clear boundary based on his own admission and a recent incident.\n\nAlso, considering their age, both are young and may be learning how to handle relationships. The author's decision to leave if he doesn't seek help shows maturity in recognizing red flags early. It's better to address potential problems before they escalate.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the incident wasn't a big deal, but physical retaliation, even with a cup of tea, is a form of aggression. The author's reaction is about preventing future incidents, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's apology and promise to get help could indicate he's aware of the issue, but the author is right to hold him accountable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking appropriate steps to ensure a healthy relationship by addressing a red flag and setting clear boundaries. Her decision to require therapy or leave is a responsible action.\n"
