We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she's leaving. So, first, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend, 19, mentioned he has anger issues. The couple had been together a month. The incident: she tapped his leg playfully, he turned around and threw his iced tea cup at her. She was upset, left, and then told him he needs therapy or she's done.\n\nNow, considering the context, the boyfriend already mentioned his anger issues. The author didn't take it seriously initially because she thought it was just teenage behavior. But when this happened, she was justified in confronting it. Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's iced, is a physical reaction that could cause harm. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is about her safety and well-being. \n\nIs she being too pushy? Well, setting boundaries in relationships is important. Anger issues, especially when they lead to physical actions, can be a red flag. The author isn't forcing him to get help through manipulation; she's stating that her needs aren't being met, and she can't stay in a situation that might escalate. She's also giving him a clear choice, which is a way to encourage responsibility.\n\nBut some might argue that she's too quick to end things after a short time. But given that he had already mentioned the anger issues, and this incident showed a pattern, her decision is proactive. She's not just reacting to this one event but addressing a known issue. Therapy is a reasonable solution. \n\nAlso, considering their ages, they're both young and still learning about relationships. The author is taking a mature approach by prioritizing her safety and communication. The boyfriend's reaction of apologizing and agreeing to get help shows he acknowledges the problem. So the author isn't the one being irrational here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She's addressing a legitimate concern and setting healthy boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
