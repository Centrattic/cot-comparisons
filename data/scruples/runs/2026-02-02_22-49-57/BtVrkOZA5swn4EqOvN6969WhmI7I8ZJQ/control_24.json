      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who directed someone to the Holocaust Museum for a hookup is in the wrong. The question is whether this is an asshole move or not.\n\nFirst, the context: the person received a message from a stranger saying \"lemme smash,\" which is slang for wanting a sexual encounter. They responded by giving a fake address\u2014the Holocaust Museum. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nHolocaust Museums are places of remembrance and education about the Holocaust. Using such a location in a joke or prank, especially for something as inappropriate as a sexual pickup, is highly offensive. It trivializes the atrocities that happened and shows a lack of respect for the victims and survivors. Even if the user intended it as a prank, the Holocaust Museum is not an appropriate setting for such a joke. It's insensitive and could be seen as disrespectful. The user might have thought it was a clever or humorous way to avoid the interaction, but the context of the location makes it unacceptable. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
