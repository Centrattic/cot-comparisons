      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who directed someone to the Holocaust museum when they wanted a hookup is in the wrong. The question is whether they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the context: someone slid into their DMs with \"lemme smash,\" which is slang for wanting a sexual encounter. The author responded by saying to meet at a Holocaust museum address. The user is asking if they're wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here. The Holocaust museum is a place that commemorates the genocide of millions. Using it as a joke or a prank in the context of a sexual request could be seen as insensitive or offensive. The Holocaust is one of the darkest chapters in human history, and making light of it, even in a joke, is generally considered disrespectful.\n\nThe author used the museum as a meeting place, which might be a way to avoid actually going through with the encounter, but the choice of location is problematic. Even if the intention was to say \"no\" in a humorous way, using a site so associated with such a serious and traumatic event could come across as tasteless. \n\nSome might argue that the author is being clever or turning down the request in a clever way, but the potential for offense is high. The Holocaust is not a topic that can be easily jest about, especially in a context where it's being used to mock or trivialize someone else's serious intentions. \n\nAlso, the person who messaged them might not have understood the reference, leading to confusion or hurt feelings. Alternatively, if they did understand, it's possible they found it offensive. Either way, the author's action could reasonably be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because they used a sensitive location inappropriately as a joke or rejection method.\n"
