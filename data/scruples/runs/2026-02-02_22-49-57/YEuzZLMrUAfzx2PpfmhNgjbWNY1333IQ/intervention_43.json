Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is 17 and has been through a lot, including a serious accident that left facial scars. They've faced bullying and have low self-esteem. They had a crush on a girl named Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out that Beck was using their relationship for a \"positive role model\" award, manipulating her friends to be nice to the author and then distancing after March. The author, feeling betrayed, decided to stop Beck from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the author being ostracized.\n\nFirst, Beck's actions were definitely manipulative and morally wrong. She used the author's genuine feelings to boost her own image, which is a form of emotional manipulation. However, the author's response was to intentionally sabotage Beck's award nomination. While Beck's actions were unethical, the author's retaliation by interfering with the award process is where the issue lies.\n\nThe key points here are: Beck's manipulation was harmful, but the author's actions were deliberate and caused Beck emotional distress. The author might feel justified, but the method they used\u2014spreading information to get the nomination withdrawn\u2014could be considered unethical as well. The author's actions caused Beck to cry and increased their own social isolation. Even though Beck was in the wrong, retaliating with such an action might be seen as crossing a line, especially since it was a direct attack on Beck's opportunity. The author's intent was revenge, which can be problematic because it perpetuates a cycle of harm.\n\nHowever, considering the author's history of being bullied and feeling isolated, their emotional state is understandable. They felt used and wanted to correct the injustice they perceived. The question is whether the ends justify the means. In most ethical frameworks, intentionally harming someone else, even in response to being harmed, is not considered acceptable. The author's actions could be seen as a form of vigilantism rather than a justified response. Therefore, while Beck was clearly in the wrong, the author's actions were also unethical and unkind, making them responsible for their own wrongdoing.\n"
