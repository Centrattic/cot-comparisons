Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped their classmate (Back) from winning an award by getting her nomination withdrawn. The reason was that Back was using the author's feelings to boost her college application. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The author had a crush on Back, went through a lot to ask her out, and they had a good time. Then the author found out that Back was using them for her social media image and an award, which is why she was getting attention. The author then took action to remove her nomination, leading Back to cry and the author being ostracized.\n\nThe key points here are consent, intent, and the methods used. The author felt manipulated and used. However, the way they retaliated involved interfering with the award process. If the author used underhanded methods, like lying or providing false information, that's definitely wrong. But if they found out through legitimate means (like the friend's screenshots) and reported it to the authorities, maybe there's a different angle.\n\nBut even if the information was true, the author's response was to sabotage Back's award. That's still unethical. The author could have confronted Back directly, ended the relationship, or reported the manipulation to the appropriate people without taking matters into their own hands. Destroying someone's nomination, even if they're manipulative, could be considered harmful and vengeful. \n\nThe author mentions family and friends as alibis, but that doesn't justify the action. The emotional harm caused by ruining someone's chance at an award is significant. Also, the author is now ostracized, which might be a consequence of their actions. \n\nThe author's trauma from bullying adds context, but doesn't excuse the retaliation. The question is whether their actions were justified. Even if Back was wrong, the author's response was to retaliate in a way that harmed Back, which is not acceptable. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they took revenge instead of addressing the situation through proper channels.\n"
