Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves stopping a classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The writer had a crush on this girl who they later found out was using them for social media clout and a college award. The writer then took action to prevent her from winning the award.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The girl manipulated the writer for her own benefit, which is clearly wrong. However, the writer's response involved actively sabotaging her award nomination. While the writer's actions were a reaction to being used, it's important to assess whether their actions were justified. \n\nThe writer mentions feeling ostracized but having no remorse. While the girl's behavior was unethical, retaliating by interfering with her award could be seen as taking things too far. The writer's actions might have been a form of revenge rather than a justifiable response. \n\nLaws and policies against sabotage usually apply here. Even if the motivation is hurt, intentionally removing someone from a nomination is not a legal or ethical way to handle the situation. The writer could have reported the girl's actions to the authorities instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nAdditionally, the emotional impact: making the girl cry is a consequence of the sabotage. While the girl's actions were inconsiderate, the writer's actions caused emotional distress as well. \n\nSo, even though the girl was in the wrong, the writer's method of response might not be justified. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because sabotaging someone's award, regardless of the reason, is not acceptable.\n"
