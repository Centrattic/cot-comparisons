Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 17 and had a traumatic accident leading to facial scars, experienced bullying. They had a crush on a classmate named Beck and went through a lot to ask her out, including writing a song and getting her favorite chocolates. Beck accepted, and they had a good time together. However, it turns out Beck was only being nice to the author as part of a scheme to win a \"positive role model\" award by pretending to be kind to someone she considered ugly. The author found out through a friend's screenshots and decided to stop Beck from winning the award, leading Beck to cry and the author becoming more ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. Beck used the author's feelings to enhance her own reputation, which is manipulative and unethical. The author, feeling betrayed and hurt, took action to sabotage Beck's award nomination. The question is whether the author's actions make them wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally harming someone's chances, even if they're manipulative, can be seen as wrong because it's a form of revenge that might not be justified. However, considering the context\u2014Beck's manipulation and the author's history of bullying\u2014the author's actions might be seen as a response to being used. But the author's method of stopping Beck (withholding information or directly causing the withdrawal) could be considered unethical as well, regardless of the motivation.\n\nLegal aspects aren't mentioned, but in a school setting, there might be policies against such actions. The author's satisfaction in the aftermath, despite the consequences, might indicate a sense of justice, but it's still a personal vendetta. The key here is whether the ends justify the means. Beck's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's retaliation might also be wrong because it involved actively interfering with Beck's award chances, which is a form of sabotage. \n\nAdditionally, the author's actions led to Beck crying, which is emotional harm. Even if Beck's intentions were bad, the author's response escalated the conflict. The author might not be entirely in the wrong given Beck's manipulation, but they did retaliate in a harmful way. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since both parties acted in ways that hurt each other, but Beck's initial manipulation was more calculated and harmful, the author's actions might be seen as a justified reaction, but ethically, retaliation is generally discouraged. So the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the deliberate sabotage, or B (no) due to the context of being manipulated.\n\nI need to weigh these factors carefully. The key is whether the author's actions were morally right. Since Beck was the one who initiated the manipulation, but the author's response was to actively prevent Beck from winning the award, which is a form of revenge. Revenge is typically considered wrong. So the author is in the wrong (A), even though Beck's actions were worse.\n"
