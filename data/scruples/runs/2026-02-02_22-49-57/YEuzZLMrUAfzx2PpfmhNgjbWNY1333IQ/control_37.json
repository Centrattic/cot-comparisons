Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a crush on a classmate, who they think was using them to win an award. The classmate made posts on social media that were nice but maybe insincere. The author found out through a friend that the classmate was only being kind to them for a short period to build her image, and then planned to distance herself. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award, which caused her to cry and be ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author was hurt and felt used, which is understandable. The classmate's actions seem manipulative and inconsiderate. However, the author's response was to deliberately sabotage her by having her nomination withdrawn. Even if the classmate was being insincere, did the author have the right to take such action?\n\nThe author mentions they have facial scars and have been bullied, which might have made them more vulnerable. The classmate's behavior was cruel, using someone's feelings for her own benefit. But the author's retaliation could be seen as revenge, which might not be justified. Even if the classmate deserved it, the author's actions could have broader consequences, like affecting the classmate's future opportunities.\n\nBut wait, the award was for being a positive role model. If the classmate was pretending to be kind, then the author's action might be seen as exposing her true character. However, the method used was to have her nomination withdrawn secretly, which might be underhanded. The author didn't confront her directly but instead took a more covert approach.\n\nAlso, the author is 17, so their emotional response might be more intense. They were hurt and wanted to protect themselves from further humiliation. But making the classmate cry and damaging her reputation could be seen as harsh. However, the classmate's actions were also harmful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's retaliation was wrong. While the classmate's behavior was bad, the author's actions might have been a form of justice in their eyes, but the method might be problematic. The author didn't have the right to interfere with the award process, even if the classmate was undeserving. The proper approach would have been to report the manipulation to the authorities or confront the classmate directly.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they took matters into their own hands, leading to negative consequences for the classmate. Even if the classmate was at fault, the author's method of response could be seen as inappropriate. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
