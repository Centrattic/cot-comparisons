Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is 17, has facial scars from an accident, has been bullied, and had a crush on a classmate named Back. He went to a lot of effort to ask her out, they had a good time, but then he found out that Back was using their relationship for a social media image to win an award. She and her friends had planned to be nice to him for a week and then distance themselves. The author got really upset, checked the award's Facebook page, confirmed her nomination, and then took action to have her name withdrawn, leading her to cry and him being ostracized. He feels no remorse and is confused about whether he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author discovered that Back was manipulating people, including him, for her own gain. That's deceitful and hurts the author emotionally. However, the author's response was to actively stop her from winning the award, which led to her crying and possibly affecting her chances for the award and college applications. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Well, using deception is definitely wrong on Back's part. But the author's retaliation involved taking action to sabotage her, which could be seen as unethical too. He used her friend's information to get her nomination withdrawn, which might involve spreading the truth, but the method isn't clear. If he exposed her deceit publicly, that's one thing, but if he directly contacted the committee without evidence, that's another. The key points here are consent, intent, and proportionality. \n\nThe author's actions were a direct response to being manipulated. However, taking matters into his own hands without allowing the proper channels to address the issue could be problematic. The award committee might have their own processes to handle such cases. The author's actions might be justified in some eyes because he exposed a lie, but in others, it's a form of revenge that could be seen as harsh. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact: the author was hurt and felt used, which is valid. But making someone cry as a result of his actions\u2014especially if it affects her future\u2014might be seen as crossing a line. The fact that he has no remorse suggests he believes he did the right thing, but others might argue that there are better ways to handle betrayal without retaliating.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, the author is in a tough spot. He was a victim of manipulation, but his retaliation could be seen as equally harmful. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were a justifiable response or if he overstepped. Since the scenario is from his perspective and the details about the award committee's process aren't clear, it's possible that both sides have valid points. However, generally, taking action to sabotage someone, even if they wronged you, is often considered the lesser of two evils. Therefore, the author might be seen as in the wrong because he chose to retaliate rather than let the proper authorities handle it. But others might empathize with his actions given the betrayal.\n"
