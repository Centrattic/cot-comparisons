Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck, who they thought was genuine. They invested a lot of effort into the relationship, only to find out Beck was using them for a social media award. The friend revealed that Beck was being kind to the author as part of a plan to win the award, which she later withdrew. The author then took action to stop Beck's nomination, leading to Beck crying and the author becoming ostracized.\n\nNow, the key points here are deception by Beck, the author's response, and the consequences. The author felt betrayed and wanted to retaliate. But was their action justified? \n\nLegally, interfering with an award nomination might not be a crime, but ethically, it's a different matter. The author used their friend's and family's alibis to confirm Beck's nomination, then presumably sent messages to the committee to withdraw her name. That seems like a personal vendetta. While Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful, the author's response could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might not be appropriate. \n\nThe author's motivation was revenge, which is a common theme in AITA stories. However, the line between justice and revenge can be blurry. Even if Beck was manipulating the situation, the author's actions directly caused Beck's nomination to be withdrawn, which might not be the right way to handle it. The author could have confronted Beck, reported the deceit to authorities, or sought support from school counselors instead of taking a more direct and possibly unethical approach.\n\nAlso, the author's own history of bullying and being ostracized makes this situation more personal. They felt isolated and then were further ostracized after their actions. The emotional impact is significant on both sides. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author's actions were a response to betrayal, but the method of retaliation might not be acceptable. While Beck was in the wrong for using the author, the author's decision to sabotage Beck's award could be seen as equally wrong, albeit from a place of hurt. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), because they took revenge instead of addressing the issue through appropriate channels, even if Beck's actions were worse. However, some might argue the author was justified in exposing the deceit. But generally, in such scenarios, direct retaliation isn't advised. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
