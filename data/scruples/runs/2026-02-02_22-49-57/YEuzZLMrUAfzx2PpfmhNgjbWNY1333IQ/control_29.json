Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being bullied due to facial scars from an accident. They had a crush on Beck, who initially seemed kind but later turned out to be using the author for her own benefit to win an award. The author discovered that Beck was only being nice to them as part of a scheme to look good for college applications. Then, the author took action to have Beck's nomination withdrawn, leading to Beck crying and the author facing more ostracism.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. Beck's actions were definitely unethical\u2014using someone's feelings for her own gain. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award nomination. While Beck's actions were hurtful, the author's retaliation involved actively interfering with the award process. \n\nIs it okay to retaliate in this way? Well, even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's method of stopping her might not be the right approach. The author could have reported Beck's actions to the authorities or shared the information truthfully, allowing the committee to make a decision. Instead, the author might have used deceptive or underhanded methods to get Beck's nomination removed. That could be seen as crossing a line, even if Beck was doing something wrong. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Beck is a factor. Making someone cry is a consequence that the author might not have intended, but it's still something to consider. The author's actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, but was that justified? It's a matter of whether taking down someone's award nomination, even if they are a manipulative person, is the right course of action. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions might be seen as revenge rather than a just response. The author was hurt and felt betrayed, which is understandable, but intentionally causing harm in return can perpetuate a cycle of negativity. The author's motivation was clear\u2014feeling used and wanting to correct the injustice, but the method might be questionable. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they are now even more ostracized. That might be a consequence of their actions, as others might not support taking such measures regardless of the situation. However, the initial betrayal by Beck is also significant. \n\nSo, considering all angles, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response of sabotaging the award might not be the right approach. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong because they chose a harmful method to address the issue instead of a more constructive one.\n"
