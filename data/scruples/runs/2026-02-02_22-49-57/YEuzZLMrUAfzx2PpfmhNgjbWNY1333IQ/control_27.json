Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, which made her cry. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a major accident with scarring, faced bullying, and had a crush on a girl named Beck. He went to great lengths to ask her out, and she accepted. He felt happy and accepted, but then found out she was using him for a social media image to win an award. He confronted the committee and her nomination was withdrawn.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author discovered that Beck was manipulating social interactions for her own benefit. He might have felt betrayed and wanted to stop her from getting an award based on inauthentic behavior. However, intentionally sabotaging someone's nomination could be seen as unethical, even if the person was being deceptive. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the method used. Beck's actions were dishonest, but the author took it upon himself to remove her nomination without going through proper channels. While her actions were manipulative, the author's response could be seen as vigilantism. The harm done to Beck by her withdrawal might not be justified by the author's personal grievances. Additionally, the author's actions might have violated the award committee's procedures, which could make him responsible for the consequences.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Beck is significant; she's crying and facing distress. Even if she was using him, the author's method of retaliation might have been harsh. However, given the betrayal and the fact that her actions were for personal gain, some might argue the author was justified in exposing the truth to the committee through proper channels. But the way he did it\u2014without giving her a chance to address it or using the right process\u2014makes it problematic.\n\nIn AITA contexts, the ethical thing is usually to handle such matters through appropriate means rather than personal sabotage. So the author might be in the wrong for taking matters into his own hands. On the other hand, Beck's manipulation is clearly wrong. It's a tough balance, but the act of intentionally derailing someone's award without due process is likely the main issue here.\n"
