Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being bullied because of their appearance. They had a crush on this girl, Beck, who accepted a date with them. But then they found out that Beck was using their relationship to boost her social media image and secure an award, which she needed for college applications. Beck's friend told the author that she planned to be kind for a few weeks and then distance herself. The author, feeling hurt and betrayed, took action to have Beck's nomination removed, which led to Beck crying.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author was emotionally manipulated by Beck, who used their relationship for personal gain. The author's actions were motivated by a sense of betrayal and a desire for revenge. They didn't act out of malice just for the sake of it but because they were hurt. However, they did actively work to sabotage Beck's award, which could be seen as unethical or even unethical retaliation.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were exploitative. She used the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong. On the other hand, the author's response involved interfering with an award process, which might not be the right way to handle the situation. The author's motivation was self-defense in a way, but the method they chose could have consequences like making Beck cry, which adds to the emotional harm.\n\nIt's possible that the author felt justified because they were the victim of manipulation, but revenge doesn't always make an action right. There's also the aspect of the award. If Beck was being nominated as a positive role model, but she used emotional manipulation, then maybe she wasn't a good candidate. However, the author's method of exposing this was through sabotage rather than reporting it through proper channels. \n\nBut the author did check if her name was on the list and involved others as alibis. Maybe they wanted to ensure the truth came out. However, the way they did it led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, which could be seen as a harsh consequence. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, ethical actions often involve resolving conflicts without causing additional harm. The author's actions caused further emotional distress to Beck and possibly others. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's retaliation might not be the appropriate response. \n\nSo considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for taking matters into their own hands in a way that harms Beck, even if they were the initial victim. The correct approach might have been to address the manipulation without sabotaging the award, maybe by talking to someone or reporting the behavior through proper channels. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
