Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (the author) had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went out, and Beck's friends were nice to the author, which made them feel accepted. Then the author found out that Beck was using this interaction for a \"positive role model\" award, pretending to be kind to someone she considered ugly. The author then took steps to stop Beck from winning the award, leading Beck to cry and the author becoming more ostracized.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, Beck's actions: She pretended to be kind to the author for her own benefit (the award), then planned to distance herself. That's definitely manipulative and unethical. She used the author's feelings and vulnerability. That's not okay. But the problem is the author's response. They intentionally sabotaged Beck's award nomination. \n\nThe author's actions led to Beck crying and losing the award. Even though Beck was in the wrong, is it okay for the author to retaliate like that? The author's motivation was hurt and betrayal, but does that justify their actions? Retaliation can be a problem because it's an eye-for-an-eye approach. Even if Beck did something wrong, the author's method of stopping her might not be appropriate. \n\nAlso, consider the impact. The author is now more ostracized, but they don't feel remorse. That's a red flag. The author's actions might have caused more harm than good, especially if Beck was genuinely affected. However, Beck's manipulation was the root cause here. The author was emotionally hurt and responded in a way that was direct but possibly not the best way to handle it.\n\nThe author's actions were intentional and purposeful, which could be seen as malicious. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's response might have crossed a line. Sabotaging someone's award could be considered unethical or even a violation of school policies. The author might have to face consequences for their actions, which were based on personal revenge rather than a constructive approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's retaliation may also be considered inappropriate. The correct approach would be to address the situation through proper channels, like reporting the manipulation to authorities or seeking support, rather than sabotaging the award. So, the author is in the wrong for their response, even if it was a reaction to being used.\n"
