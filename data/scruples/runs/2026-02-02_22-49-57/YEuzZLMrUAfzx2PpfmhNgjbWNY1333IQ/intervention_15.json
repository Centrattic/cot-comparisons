Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by stopping their classmate from winning an award after discovering she was using them for social media clout and a college application. The author felt betrayed and took action, leading to the classmate's emotional distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's actions involved preventing someone from winning an award they were nominated for. Even if the classmate was manipulating the situation, the author's response involved interfering with the nomination process. Is this justified?\n\nThe classmate's behavior was clearly manipulative and hurtful. She used the author's feelings to boost her own image. That's morally wrong. However, the author's response was to sabotage her award nomination. This raises the question: does the wrong done by one party justify retaliatory actions by the other?\n\nThe author claims they had no remorse and felt satisfied. But causing someone else to cry and being ostracized themselves might not be the best outcomes. Retaliation can perpetuate a cycle of harm. Even if the classmate was in the wrong, the author's method of addressing it\u2014without going through proper channels\u2014could be seen as unethical.\n\nLegally and ethically, interfering with an award nomination might be a violation of the award's rules. The author might have used coercion or other means to get the nomination withdrawn. That could be considered a breach of trust or even a policy violation.\n\nEmotionally, the author was hurt, but their response might not be the healthiest way to handle it. It's possible they were seeking revenge rather than finding a constructive solution. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the classmate deserved to lose the award, the author's actions might not be the appropriate way to achieve that.\n\nOn the other hand, the classmate manipulated the author for personal gain, which is a serious violation of trust. The author might feel justified in wanting to expose her actions or prevent her from benefiting from them. However, using underhanded methods to do so could be seen as equally unethical.\n\nIn conclusion, while the classmate's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response of actively undermining her award nomination might not be justified. The appropriate course of action might have been to report the manipulation through proper channels rather than taking personal action. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for their retaliatory behavior, even if the classmate was at fault.\n"
