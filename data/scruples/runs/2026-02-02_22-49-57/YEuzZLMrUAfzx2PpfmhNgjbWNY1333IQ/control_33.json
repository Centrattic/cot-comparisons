Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who stopped their classmate from winning an award by providing evidence that the classmate was using their kindness for a social media image and college application. The person in question also made the classmate cry.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of the author. The author discovered that their classmate, Beck, was using them for social media posts to boost her image for an award. Feeling betrayed, the author took steps to have Beck's nomination withdrawn, which succeeded. The author feels no remorse and is satisfied with the outcome.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the author's actions were preemptive. They found out about Beck's plan to distance themself after March and used that information to sabotage Beck's award nomination. While Beck's actions were manipulative and hurtful, the author's response involved actively intervening in the award process, possibly without Beck knowing. This could be seen as unethical because it involves undermining someone's legitimate application, even if the application was based on false pretenses. However, some might argue that the author was retaliating against being used and manipulated, so it's a form of self-defense in emotional terms.\n\nLegally, if the award process was formal and the author provided evidence to the committee, it might be within the rules. But the method of obtaining the evidence (like screenshots from a friend) might be questionable. Also, the emotional impact on Beck, causing her to cry, adds another layer. The author's motivation was self-defense and protecting their self-esteem, but their actions led to public shaming and further ostracism for themselves.\n\nConsidering both perspectives: Beck's manipulation was wrong, but the author's response, while understandable, might be seen as crossing a line from self-defense to retaliation. The author's actions had real consequences on Beck's opportunities and emotional well-being. Therefore, the author's actions, while motivated by a sense of justice, might be considered ethically questionable because they actively interfered with Beck's application, even if the application was insincere.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because manipulating the award process, even in response to manipulation, is not the appropriate or ethical solution. It's important to address the initial wrong through communication or other means rather than retaliating in a way that harms the other person.\n"
