Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped their classmate from winning an award and made her cry because they found out she was using them for her own gain.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author had a crush on Beck, who accepted their advances. Beck's friend revealed that Beck was only being nice to the author for a few weeks to improve her social media image and win a \"positive role model\" award. The author, feeling betrayed, then took action to prevent Beck from winning the award, leading to Beck's nomination being withdrawn and her crying.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. If Beck was indeed manipulating the author's feelings for her own benefit, that's pretty manipulative and harmful. The author's actions could be seen as revenge, which raises questions about their morality. However, the author's actions involved actively sabotaging someone else's opportunity, which is generally considered unethical.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful. On the other hand, the author's response was to intentionally cause harm to Beck, which might not be justified even if Beck was wrong. The author's motivation was based on feeling used, but does that justify unethical behavior?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they now feel more satisfied but are being ostracized. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's approach might still be considered wrong because they took it upon themselves to retaliate, which could be seen as taking justice into their own hands.\n\nIn most moral frameworks, while Beck's actions are condemnable, the author's retaliation could be seen as equally harmful. The author's actions caused emotional distress to Beck and disrupted her award nomination, which might be considered an overreaction or an act of personal vendetta. There's also the aspect of not going through proper channels to address the manipulation, instead choosing to sabotage.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions were a form of revenge that caused harm, even if they felt justified. The right approach would have been to confront Beck directly or seek support from authorities or counseling rather than sabotage her award.\n"
