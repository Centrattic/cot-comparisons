Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, which made her cry. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on Beck and went through a lot to ask her out. They felt accepted and happy, but then found out that Beck was only being nice as part of a scheme to win a \"positive role model\" award for her college applications. The author was hurt and angry, so they took action to get her nomination removed. Now, the author is facing backlash but feels justified.\n\nSo, what's the right approach here? Well, Beck's actions were definitely wrong. She manipulated the author's feelings for her own gain, using their insecurities for social media clout. That's really hurtful and unethical. The author felt betrayed and wanted revenge. But the question is whether the author's actions were right.\n\nThe author investigated the award, confirmed Beck's nomination, and then took steps (with help from friends and family) to have her nomination withdrawn. This led to Beck crying and the author becoming more ostracized. The author has no remorse and feels satisfied, but now others say they're wrong.\n\nLegally, if the award required honesty, and Beck lied about her actions (pretending to be kind to the author when she wasn't), then the author exposing the truth could be justified. However, the method of stopping the nomination\u2014did the author have the right to do that? If they reported the truth to the committee, maybe that's fair. But if they spread false information, then it's not. The details here say the author \"researched\" and went to authorities, so maybe it was legitimate. \n\nEmotionally, the author was hurt and seeking justice. Beck's actions were deceptive. However, the author's response was to ruin Beck's chances, which could be seen as revenge. Even if Beck deserved it, hurting someone else, even if they were wrong, can have consequences. The author now feels ostracized, which is part of the fallout.\n\nBut considering the context of bullying and the author's history of being bullied, maybe the author felt that Beck was exploiting them further. The balance between justice and revenge is tricky. If the author acted within the rules (e.g., reporting to the committee), maybe it's justified. If they acted outside the law, then it's not. The story says they went to authorities, so it's possible the committee withdrew the nomination based on truth, which would be right.\n\nHowever, the author's actions did make Beck cry, which is hurtful. Even if Beck was wrong, the author's response might be excessive. It's a question of proportionality. The author's emotional state and past trauma might influence their judgment, but does that justify their actions? \n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes people do retaliate when they feel wronged, but it's usually considered better to address the issue directly or through proper channels. The author did go to authorities, so maybe that's the right approach. But causing someone else to suffer, even if they were wrong, can be seen as morally questionable.\n\nSo, on one hand, Beck's manipulation was bad. On the other, the author's retaliation might have been excessive. The answer depends on whether the author's actions were a justified exposure of Beck's deceit or an act of revenge. If the former, maybe not in the wrong. If the latter, then yes. The line between justice and revenge is thin here.\n\nGiven that the author acted within the system (went to authorities), it's possible they did the right thing. But if they lied or used underhanded methods, then no. The story says they researched and went to authorities, so maybe they told the truth. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because Beck's nomination was based on falsehoods. But if the committee didn't have evidence, the author's role in providing it is a factor.\n\nOverall, Beck's actions were worse, but the author's response might still be problematic. However, given the information, if the author exposed the truth through proper channels, they might be justified. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a strong argument for A too. Considering the context, maybe B is the better choice here.\n"
