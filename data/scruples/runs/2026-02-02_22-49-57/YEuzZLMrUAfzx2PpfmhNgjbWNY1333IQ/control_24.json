Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on a girl named Beck, who they thought was genuinely kind. They went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out that Beck was using them for social media posts to look good for a college award. The author got angry and intentionally stopped her from winning the award, which made her cry. Now the author is being criticized for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Beck's actions. She pretended to be nice to the author for a few weeks to boost her social media presence for an award. That's definitely manipulative and wrong. She used the author's feelings and their genuine effort to get close to her for her own benefit. That's pretty despicable. So Beck is definitely at fault here.\n\nNow, the author found out about this and decided to retaliate by getting her nomination withdrawn. They did some research, checked the Facebook page, and had friends and family as alibis. The result was Beck losing her chance at the award and being upset. The author feels justified, but others are saying the author is wrong.\n\nThe key question is: Is the author's retaliation justified? Well, Beck's actions were unethical and hurtful. The author was manipulated and used, which can be really traumatic, especially for someone who's already been bullied. The author's actions might be seen as revenge, which is a gray area. However, Beck's actions were the root cause here. The author didn't physically harm anyone; they just removed her from the competition. But was it right to do that?\n\nOn one hand, the author was protecting themselves from further emotional harm and exposing Beck's deceit. On the other hand, sabotaging someone's award, even if they're in the wrong, isn't typically considered a socially acceptable response. People might argue that the author should have reported Beck's behavior to the authorities or the award committee through proper channels instead of taking personal action. That way, the system could handle it without the author getting involved in what might be seen as vigilantism.\n\nAlso, the author's emotional state is important. They've been bullied and had a traumatic experience with the accident. Their actions could be seen as a form of self-defense in an emotional sense. But in reality, retaliating by ruining someone's chances, even if they're bad, can lead to more problems. The author is now ostracized, which might be a consequence of their actions, but they don't feel remorse, which indicates they believe their actions were justified.\n\nHowever, from a moral standpoint, the author's actions might not be the right way to handle the situation. While Beck was in the wrong, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line, even if the motivation was understandable. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and taking matters into one's own hands. The author could have spoken to the committee or documented Beck's behavior to let the process take its course instead of directly sabotaging her.\n\nIn conclusion, Beck is clearly in the wrong for manipulating the author. But the author's response, while understandable given the betrayal, might not be the correct approach. It's a tough situation because the victim is also acting out of hurt. But in terms of right and wrong, the author's actions might be considered unethical or inappropriate, even if motivated by a desire for justice. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
