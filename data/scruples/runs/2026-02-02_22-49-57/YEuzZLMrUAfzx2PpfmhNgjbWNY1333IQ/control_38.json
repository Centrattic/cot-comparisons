Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a crush on Beck, who was using the author to boost her own image for a college application award. Beck's friends were being nice to the author as part of this scheme. When the author found out, they took action to stop Beck from winning the award, which led to Beck crying and the author facing backlash.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Beck's deception, the author's motivation, the method used to stop Beck, and the consequences. \n\nBeck's actions were manipulative. She pretended to be kind to the author for personal gain, which is unethical. The author discovered this and felt betrayed, which is understandable. The author's intent was to prevent Beck from winning the award based on false merits. However, the author took it upon themselves to withdraw Beck's nomination, which involved checking the nomination list and possibly using others to do it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck's behavior was exploitative. On the other hand, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award, which could be seen as a form of revenge. But is revenge justified in this case? Also, the author's actions might have violated the award committee's process by interfering with the nominations. \n\nThe author didn't go through proper channels to report Beck's deception. Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which could be considered unethical or even a breach of school rules. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's method of stopping her might not be the right approach. \n\nAdditionally, the author is now facing more ostracism, but they don't feel remorse. That suggests they see themselves as justified, but others might argue that the proper way is to report the situation through the correct authorities rather than personal intervention. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. Depending on the culture and the specific rules of the award, the author's actions might be considered inappropriate. However, there's also sympathy for the author's emotional pain and the betrayal they felt. \n\nBut legally and ethically, the author probably did something wrong by interfering with the nomination process. They didn't report it through official channels, which might have been the right approach. Their actions led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn, which could be unfair to Beck if the committee had a process to handle such cases. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't use the proper method to address the deception and instead took direct action that affected Beck's opportunity. Even though Beck's behavior was manipulative, the author's response was not the correct way to handle it.\n"
