Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the story is about a person who sabotaged their classmate (Back) from winning an award because they felt used. The author had a crush on Back, went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out that Back was only being nice to them for her own benefit\u2014specifically to boost her college applications by getting a \"positive role model\" award. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award, leading to Back's nomination being withdrawn and her crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Sabotaging someone, even if you feel wronged, usually isn't considered right. The author's actions involved researching the award and getting others involved to withdraw the nomination. That seems like an intentional act to harm someone else's chances, which is generally wrong. But there's a context here: the author felt emotionally manipulated and used. They might believe that Back's actions were unethical as well.\n\nHowever, even if someone wrongs you, retaliating can be problematic. The author's response was to undermine Back's award, which might be seen as a form of revenge. While Back's behavior was manipulative and inconsiderate, the author's reaction could be seen as crossing a line. The key question is whether the means justify the ends. The author claims they have no remorse, but the consequences for Back were significant\u2014she didn't win the award and was upset. Meanwhile, the author is facing ostracism but feels satisfied. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author's motivation was to stop Back from receiving something she didn't deserve, but the method was to deliberately interfere with the process. This could be considered unethical, regardless of the reason. There might be better ways to address the situation, like reporting the manipulation to the proper authorities instead of personal sabotage.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their personal struggles with bullying due to their appearance. That adds a layer of vulnerability, but it doesn't necessarily justify their actions. The response to being treated poorly doesn't make the retaliation acceptable in a moral sense.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, intentional harm\u2014even in response to harm\u2014is not justified. However, there's also the aspect of self-respect and standing up for oneself. But in this case, the author didn't just stand up for themselves; they took active steps to harm another person's opportunity. That's a key difference.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable in the context of feeling used, are ethically questionable. They chose to retaliate in a way that directly affected someone else's chances, which is typically seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
