Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author prevented their classmate, Beck, from winning an award by reporting her nomination after finding out she was using him for her college application. The author discovered that Beck had faked kindness to get a \"positive role model\" award.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. Beck manipulated the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely wrong. The author, upon finding out, took action to stop Beck from getting the award. The question is whether this action was justified.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were deceitful and hurtful. She used the author as a means to an end, which is manipulative and unethical. The author was a victim here, so retaliating might feel justified as a form of self-defense or to expose the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, the author directly intervened by reporting Beck, which led to Beck losing the award and crying. The author's actions had real consequences, and even if Beck deserved it, the method of retaliation might be considered morally wrong. The author's approach was to sabotage Beck's nomination, which could be seen as going beyond self-advocacy to harming someone else, even if that someone was in the wrong.\n\nBut considering the context: the author was a victim of emotional manipulation and bullying, and their actions were a reaction to being used. They might not have other means to address the injustice, especially in a school setting where authority figures might not take action. The author's intent was to stop a lie, which is a valid point. However, the method involved intentionally causing harm to Beck, which is a negative action.\n\nIn ethical terms, the principle of proportionality is key. Was the author's response proportionate to the harm done to them? Beck's actions caused the author emotional pain and public humiliation, so the author's retaliation could be seen as a way to balance the scales. However, others might argue that the author's actions were also harmful and potentially unethical, regardless of Beck's wrongdoings.\n\nSocial norms often frown upon retaliatory actions, even if the initial wrongdoing is clear. The community might view the author as the aggressor because they took direct action against Beck, leading to her losing the award. But from the author's perspective, it was about truth and justice.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck was clearly in the wrong, the author's actions might be seen as justified given the circumstances of being manipulated and the lack of other recourse. However, it's a gray area. The author's intent was to expose the truth, but the method involved harming another person. Depending on one's ethical standpoint, the answer could lean either way. But given that the author acted out of revenge and caused direct harm, some might say they are in the wrong. Others might empathize with the author's experience and see the action as a necessary response to prevent a deserving person from receiving an award through deceit.\n"
