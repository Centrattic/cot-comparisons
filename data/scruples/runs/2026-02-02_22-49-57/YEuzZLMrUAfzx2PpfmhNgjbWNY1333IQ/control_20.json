Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 17 and has faced bullying due to facial scars, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went on a date, and Beck's friends were nice to the author, which made them feel accepted. Then the author found out that Beck had manipulated things to get attention from her friends for her own college application, using the author as part of her \"positive role model\" award. The author then took steps to stop Beck from winning the award, leading Beck to cry and the author facing more ostracism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Beck's actions seem manipulative and exploitative. She used the author's feelings and her appearance to gain social credit for an award. That's definitely unethical. However, the author's response was to actively sabotage Beck's nomination, which resulted in Beck losing the award and being upset. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's retaliation was justified. While Beck's actions were wrong, does that make the author's actions okay? The author's approach involved researching the award, contacting authorities, and ensuring Beck's name was withdrawn. This is a direct and possibly underhanded method to prevent Beck from winning. The author may not feel remorse, but the action of intentionally harming someone else's opportunity, even if they were in the wrong, could be seen as morally wrong. Revenge or retaliation, even when wronged, often isn't considered the right approach. \n\nAdditionally, the author's actions led to Beck crying and increased ostracism for the author. While Beck's manipulation was hurtful, the author's response might not be the appropriate way to handle it. There might have been other ways to address the situation, like confronting Beck directly or seeking support from a trusted adult. Instead, the author chose to retaliate, which could be seen as escalating the conflict. \n\nHowever, considering the author's background of being bullied and manipulated, their actions might stem from a place of pain and a desire for justice. But even so, the ethical stance usually leans against taking matters into one's own hands. The author's actions could be viewed as wrong because they didn't follow proper channels to address the manipulation. The act of sabotaging someone's award nomination is a form of retaliation that isn't typically condoned, regardless of the provocation.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's behavior was clearly wrong, the author's method of response may not be the right way to handle it. The author is in the wrong for taking actions that directly harmed Beck's chances, even if Beck was at fault. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
