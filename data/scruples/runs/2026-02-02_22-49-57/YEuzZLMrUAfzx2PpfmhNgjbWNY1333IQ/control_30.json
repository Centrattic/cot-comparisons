Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a crush on a girl named Beck, who accepted his advances, but later he found out she was using him for a social media image and a college award. In response, he stopped her from winning the award, leading her to cry and him being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was vulnerable with facial scars, had been bullied, and felt accepted when Beck accepted his feelings. Then he found out she was insincere, using him for her own gain. His reaction was to sabotage her award, which involved checking the nominations and getting others to confirm her names were removed. Now, he's facing backlash, and people say he's wrong.\n\nSo, the ethical question here is about the appropriateness of his response. Did he cross a line by intentionally ruining her chances for the award? Even though she may have wronged him, does that justify his actions?\n\nFrom one angle, Beck's manipulation was hurtful and deceitful. She used him, pretending to be kind and then distancing herself. That's certainly wrong. But the author's response was to actively interfere with her award, which is a more severe action. Sabotage, even in retaliation, is not a socially acceptable response. It's important to consider whether there were other ways to address the situation, like confronting her directly or seeking support from authorities without undermining her award. \n\nThe author might feel justified because of the emotional harm he experienced, but that doesn't make his actions right. Retaliation often escalates conflicts and can lead to more harm. Additionally, the author's actions caused Beck to cry and face the withdrawal of her nomination, which could have been a significant setback for her. \n\nHowever, the context of the author's own vulnerabilities and past bullying might evoke sympathy. He felt deeply hurt and manipulated. But even in cases of betrayal, the method of response matters. The key here is whether his actions were proportionate and ethically appropriate. \n\nIn many moral frameworks, causing harm in retaliation is not condoned, unless it's through proper channels. The author didn't report the manipulation through the appropriate means but instead took direct action to undermine her. That's a problem. \n\nTherefore, while Beck's actions were definitely wrong, the author's response also involved unethical behavior. He might not be entirely wrong in feeling hurt, but his choice to sabotage the award is what would place him in the wrong. So the answer is likely A.\n"
