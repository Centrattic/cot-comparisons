Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who has facial scars and has been bullied, had a crush on a classmate named Beck. They went on a date, and Beck's friends were nice to them at first but then distanced after March. The author found out that Beck was using the relationship to boost her college application by pretending to be a positive role model, even making posts like #uglypeoplematter. The author then took action to have Beck's nomination for the award withdrawn, leading Beck to cry and the author to become more ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author was in a relationship where Beck was supposedly kind but had ulterior motives. The author's actions were to stop Beck from winning the award. But is that justified? On one hand, Beck manipulated the situation for her own gain, which is wrong. The author felt betrayed and hurt, which is understandable. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's nomination. That could be seen as revenge, which might not be the right approach. \n\nThe author mentions that they had alibis and went to authorities, but if they didn't have a direct way to prevent Beck from winning, maybe they used some underhanded methods. Even if Beck was being deceptive, the author's action of causing her nomination to be withdrawn might have involved lying or spreading information, which is also unethical. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. They were acting out of pain and anger from being used. But does that justify retaliating? It's a common dilemma where someone feels wronged and takes matters into their own hands. While Beck's behavior was clearly inconsiderate, the author's action could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAnother angle: the author might not have been the only one involved in the award process. If they provided false information or interfered with the committee's decision, that's their fault. But if they simply exposed Beck's deceit, maybe it's different. The post doesn't specify the method, but the fact that the nomination was withdrawn after the author's actions suggests some form of intervention that might not be appropriate.\n\nSo, the key points are Beck's manipulation, the author's emotional response, and the method used to stop the award. If the author acted in a way that's unethical or violated the rules, they're in the wrong. But if they merely reported the truth, maybe not. However, the author's actions led Beck to cry and withdrew her nomination, which could affect her opportunities. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's retaliation might have been harmful. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author used dishonest means. Since they didn't say they directly confronted Beck or let the committee know the truth through proper channels, but instead had their friends and family as alibis, it might imply they spread some form of false information. So, even if Beck deserved it, the author's method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
