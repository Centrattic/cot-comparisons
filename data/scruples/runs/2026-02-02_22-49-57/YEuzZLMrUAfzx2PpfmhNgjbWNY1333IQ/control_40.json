Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on this girl named Beck, who they thought was genuine in their kindness. But then Beck's friend told the author that Beck was using them for a social media image and to help her win an award. The author then took action to stop Beck from winning the award, which resulted in Beck crying and the author becoming more ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Beck's actions. If Beck was pretending to be kind to the author for her own benefit (the award), that's pretty manipulative. But the author's response was to sabotage Beck's chances at the award. Is that justified?\n\nThe author mentions that they went to the authorities to withdraw Beck's nomination. How did they do that? They used their friend, family, and others as alibis. But did they have evidence that Beck was being fake? The author found a Facebook page and checked the nominations list. Maybe they reported Beck, but was that the right approach?\n\nThe author is saying Beck was insincere and using them for her college applications. That's a serious accusation. If Beck actually lied about her community service or the award requirements, then maybe the author's action was a form of justice. But the method\u2014intentionally stopping her from winning and making her cry\u2014could be seen as revenge, not justice. \n\nAlso, the author's emotional state is important. They've been bullied and had facial scars from an accident, which makes them vulnerable. Beck's manipulation might have been a betrayal. But taking matters into their own hands and ruining Beck's award chances could be seen as crossing a line, even if Beck was in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were proportionate. Beck's actions were unethical, but the author's retaliation might be considered vindictive. The author didn't report it through proper channels but instead actively worked to sabotage Beck. Even if Beck deserved it, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they didn't follow the right process. \n\nAlso, the consequences: Beck is crying, and the author is now more ostracized. Both sides are suffering, but the author's action caused harm. The author might believe they were protecting themselves from being used again, but others might see it as taking revenge instead of addressing the issue through appropriate means. \n\nSo, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's method of dealing with it might not be justified. The author could have reported Beck's manipulation to the authorities or the award committee to let them handle it. Instead, they took personal action, which might be considered the wrong approach even if the motive was to stop Beck's deceit. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their response. Answer A.\n"
