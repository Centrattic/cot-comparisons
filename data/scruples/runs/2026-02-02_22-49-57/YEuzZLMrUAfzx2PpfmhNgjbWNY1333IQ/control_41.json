Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is pretty intense. The author had a crush on a girl named Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and then found out she was using him for an award. He then stopped her from winning the award, leading her to cry and face consequences. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. Beck was using him for a social media image to win an award. She manipulated her friends to be kind, then planned to distance him after March. The author felt betrayed and decided to take action. He researched the award, confirmed her nomination, and with help, had her nomination withdrawn. The consequences for Beck include crying and being ostracized, while the author feels satisfaction but now faces more bullying.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The author's actions were deliberate to stop her from winning, which is a form of revenge. Even if Beck was using him, does that justify the author's retaliation? There's a line between standing up for oneself and taking unethical measures. Beck's actions were manipulative and hurtful, but the author's response involved undermining her in a way that affected her opportunities. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? He was wronged first, but his response could be seen as harmful. However, the context of being bullied and then betrayed might make his actions more understandable. But ethically, sabotaging someone's award, even if they manipulated you, is not the right approach. It's important to address the issue through proper channels rather than personal revenge. \n\nSo, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's method of retaliation might make him equally at fault. He could have reported her actions to authorities instead of taking matters into his own hands. His actions caused harm to Beck and himself, leading to more ostracism. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his response was unethical despite the betrayal.\n"
