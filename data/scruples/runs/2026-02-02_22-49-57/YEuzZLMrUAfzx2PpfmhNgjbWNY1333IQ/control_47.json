Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on this girl, Beck, who was using him for image points to win an award. She posted things on social media that were kind of degrading, like calling him ugly but saying beautiful people accept ugly people. Then the author found out she was only being nice to him temporarily for her own benefit, which made him stop liking her. Now he's trying to stop her from winning the award by making sure her nomination gets pulled, which he did, and now she's crying and he's getting more ostracized. \n\nThe main question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Beck's actions: She pretended to be kind to someone just to boost her own image for an award. That's manipulative and probably not okay. But the author took it upon himself to sabotage her nomination. He used his friend and family as alibis, which might involve lying or deception. The award is about being a positive role model, and if she was faking kindness, then maybe she shouldn't win it. But did he have the right to interfere?\n\nOn one hand, Beck was using the author's feelings for her own gain, which is definitely wrong. The author felt betrayed and hurt, which is valid. But on the other hand, the author's response was to retaliate by getting her nomination revoked. That seems like a harsh reaction. What if the committee had already verified her actions? The author's actions might have undermined the process. Also, making her cry and causing her emotional distress is a consequence of his actions. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own situation. He's been bullied and has scars, which makes his emotional state more fragile. But does that justify retaliating? Maybe not. The right way to handle it would have been to report her behavior to the committee, let them decide, rather than taking matters into his own hands. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a form of revenge. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's method of stopping her was unethical because it involved deception and possibly illegal actions (depending on what he did). The author's lack of remorse suggests he might not see it as wrong, but from an ethical standpoint, interfering with someone's nomination without proper process is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
