Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The author's actions were motivated by discovering that their crush, Beck, was using them for social media clout and a college application award. The author then took steps to have Beck's nomination withdrawn, leading to Beck's emotional distress and their own increased ostracization.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Beck's actions were manipulative and exploitative. She pretended to be kind and interested in the author, but it was all a facade to boost her own image and win an award. That's clearly wrong. The author found out and decided to retaliate by sabotaging Beck's nomination. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for doing that? Well, taking someone's nomination away without proper process might be unethical. The author didn't go through the correct channels, maybe. They might have interfered in a way that's not acceptable. However, Beck's actions were in bad faith. The author probably felt violated and humiliated. Their response was a form of revenge, which is understandable but not necessarily the right approach.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's manipulation was harmful and deserves to be addressed. On the other hand, the author's method of retaliation could be seen as a form of sabotage that's not fair. But considering Beck's actions were deceptive and exploitative, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the author's actions might have crossed a line by directly interfering with the award process. It's a gray area. \n\nAnother angle: the author was a victim of emotional manipulation. They were made to feel accepted, only to be rejected and used. The author's emotional response is valid, but the method of revenge might not be the best way to handle it. The author could have reported Beck's actions to the authorities properly instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's retaliation might not be the right approach. The author could have been more in the right if they had gone through proper channels to address the issue. By directly sabotaging Beck's nomination without following the correct procedures, the author might be seen as acting out of vengeance rather than seeking a fair resolution. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for their method, even if their motives were understandable.\n"
