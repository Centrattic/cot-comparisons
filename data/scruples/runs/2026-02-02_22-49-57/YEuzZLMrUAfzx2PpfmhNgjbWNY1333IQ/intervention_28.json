Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is dealing with a situation where they felt they were used by someone they had a crush on. The girl, Beck, apparently used the author's feelings to boost her own social media presence and college application chances. The author, after finding out, took steps to prevent her from winning an award by stopping her nomination, which led to Beck crying and the author facing more ostracism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author's actions of stopping Beck from winning could be seen as retaliatory. Even though there was betrayal, intentionally interfering with someone's award might be considered going too far. The author's motivation is understandable given the emotional pain, but is it justifiable? \n\nOn the other hand, Beck manipulated the author's feelings for personal gain, which is morally wrong. The author was already vulnerable due to past trauma and being bullied, which might explain their reaction. However, the author's response involved deliberate sabotage, which could be seen as harmful as well. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. The author felt betrayed and used, but retaliating by undermining someone's award might not be the appropriate way to handle the hurt. The author's actions could be viewed as crossing a line, even if the initial wrongdoing was severe.\n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the author is now facing more social consequences. Even if they have \"no remorse,\" that doesn't necessarily mean they're in the right. The situation is complex, but the act of purposefully stopping someone from receiving an award, regardless of the reason, is generally considered unethical. So, while Beck's actions were definitely wrong, the author's response could also be considered in the wrong because they chose to retaliate in a harmful manner. \n\nTherefore, considering the ethical implications and the actions taken, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
