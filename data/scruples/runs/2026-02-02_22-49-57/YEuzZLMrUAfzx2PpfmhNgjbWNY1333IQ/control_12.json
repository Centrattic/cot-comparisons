Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author purposefully stopped their classmate (Back) from winning an award by making the committee remove her name, leading her to cry. The author's motivation was discovering that Back was using them for social media clout and college applications, pretending to be kind but planning to distance after March.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author was manipulated\u2014Back used them for her own gain, which is clearly wrong. However, the author's response was to sabotage her award nomination. Even if Back's actions were unethical, retaliating by interfering with her award could be seen as unjustified. The author might feel wronged, but taking matters into their own hands by contacting the committee and causing Back to lose the award might not be the right approach. \n\nEmotional harm is involved on both sides. The author felt used and hurt, which is valid. But Back's actions, while manipulative, don't excuse the author's actions. The key point is whether the author's retaliation was proportionate. Sabotaging someone's award could be considered a form of revenge, which is generally frowned upon. It's important to consider if there were other ways to address the situation, like confronting Back directly or reporting her actions through appropriate channels rather than personal interference.\n\nAlso, the author's mental state and history of bullying might influence their actions, but it doesn't absolve them of responsibility for their own unethical behavior. The fact that the author now faces ostracism might be a consequence of their actions, but that doesn't mean their actions were justified. The question is whether the ends (seeking justice for being used) justify the means (sabotage). Typically, in ethical discussions, the means matter a lot. Even if someone is wronged, retaliating in a harmful way can make them equally at fault.\n\nTherefore, while Back's actions were exploitative, the author's response was not appropriate. The author is in the wrong for taking revenge instead of addressing the issue through proper channels. The answer should be A.\n"
