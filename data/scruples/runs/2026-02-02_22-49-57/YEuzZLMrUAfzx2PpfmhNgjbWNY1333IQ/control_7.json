Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The author is a 17-year-old who has scars from an accident and has faced bullying. They had a crush on a classmate named Beck, went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and she accepted. However, it turns out Beck was manipulating the situation for her own college application by gaining a \"positive role model\" award. The author discovered this through screenshots from Beck's friend, which showed Beck's insincere intentions. In response, the author took actions that led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn and caused her to cry. Now, the author is facing backlash and is questioning their actions.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Beck's Actions**: She used the author for her own benefit, pretending to be kind to gain social media attention and an award. This is clearly manipulative and exploitative. However, the author's response involved actively interfering with Beck's nomination, which could be seen as retaliatory.\n\n2. **Author's Motivation**: The author was hurt and felt betrayed after investing emotional effort into a relationship that was insincere. Their actions were a direct response to being manipulated. However, the method of stopping Beck's award\u2014possibly by contacting the committee\u2014could be seen as underhanded, even if the motivation was personal.\n\n3. **Consequences**: Beck withdrew her nomination and was upset. The author now faces more ostracism but feels no remorse. The author's actions resolved their personal grievance but may have crossed ethical lines.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Even if Beck's actions were wrong, the author's retaliation involved undermining someone else's achievements. While understandable emotionally, it's a form of sabotage. The question is whether the ends justify the means.\n\n5. **Legal and Social Norms**: The author didn't commit a crime but breached social trust. The school environment is a community where such actions can have ripple effects. The author's approach might be seen as a violation of the school's ethical standards, regardless of Beck's behavior.\n\n6. **Emotional Justification**: The author's experience with bullying and being ostracized adds context. They might feel empowered by taking action against Beck. However, this doesn't necessarily excuse the action of undermining someone else's goals.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong: While Beck's manipulation is inexcusable, the author's response could be seen as an overreaction. The correct course might have been to address the personal hurt without interfering with Beck's award. However, the author might argue that the system allowed exploitation, so their actions were a form of justice.\n\nIn many cases, retaliation isn't considered the right approach, even if the initial harm was significant. The author's actions caused direct harm to Beck's opportunities and emotional well-being, which is a valid concern. Therefore, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response involved unethical behavior that likely makes them in the wrong in this situation.\n"
