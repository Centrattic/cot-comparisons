Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. I need to figure out if stopping someone from winning an award by exposing their manipulation is justified.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a crush on Beck, who used them for social media clout to win an award. Beck's actions were deceitful\u2014pretending to be kind to someone she considered ugly for her own benefit. The author discovered this through a friend and then took action to stop Beck from getting the award, leading to Beck's nomination being withdrawn and her crying. The author feels justified but is now ostracized.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception, manipulation, and the author's response. Beck used the author for her own gain, which is ethically wrong. The author found out and took steps to expose or prevent Beck from getting the award. Now, whether that's right or wrong.\n\nOn one hand, Beck's behavior is clearly unethical. She manipulated the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is harmful. The author was vulnerable, having faced bullying due to scars, and was genuinely trying to form a meaningful connection. Beck's actions were selfish and took advantage of that vulnerability.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response involved actively trying to stop Beck from winning the award. This could be seen as a form of retaliation. The question is whether the ends justify the means. The author might argue that Beck didn't deserve the award because it was based on a lie. But the method\u2014exposing the truth\u2014could be considered justified if it's to correct a wrong. However, if the author used underhanded methods (like doxxing or spreading false information), that's another issue. The post mentions the author checked the nomination list and had alibis, so maybe they acted within the system's rules.\n\nAnother angle: the author's action led to Beck crying and being ostracized. But Beck's actions were the root cause. The author might feel that the punishment fits the crime, but it's still emotionally charged. The author's own experience with bullying might make them more sensitive to being manipulated and taking action to protect themselves.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often focuses on whether the action was proportionate and if there were better ways to handle it. The author could have confronted Beck directly or reported the unethical behavior through proper channels. But instead, they took a more aggressive approach, which might be seen as crossing a line, even if Beck's actions were worse.\n\nHowever, if the author exposed the truth in a legitimate way (like contacting the committee with evidence), that's different. The post says they checked the nomination list and had alibis, so maybe they acted within the rules. In that case, the committee might have withdrawn the nomination on their own upon learning the truth, making the author's action a form of whistleblowing.\n\nBut the problem is the method. If the author sent a message to the committee with the evidence, that's one thing. If they spread the information publicly or used threats, that's another. The post isn't entirely clear on the exact method, but they mention receiving a message from the committee, implying that the author provided the evidence, leading to the withdrawal. That could be seen as the right action to correct a wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, Beck's actions were in the wrong, and the author's response could be justified as a way to expose the deceit and prevent Beck from benefiting from it. However, the emotional response (making Beck cry) and the personal vendetta might make some people see the author as also in the wrong. The community's reaction in the post suggests many think the author is wrong, but the ethical perspective might lean towards the author acting in self-defense against manipulation."
