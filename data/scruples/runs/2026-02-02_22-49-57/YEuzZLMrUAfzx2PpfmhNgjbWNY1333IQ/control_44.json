Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, which led to the girl crying. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a crush on a girl named Beck. They went on a date, and Beck's friends were acting kindly towards the author. Later, the author found out that Beck had been using their relationship for a \"positive role model\" award, manipulating people to be nice to them. The author then took action to remove Beck's nomination, leading to her emotional distress.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The author believed they were being used by Beck for her own benefit. Beck's actions were deceitful, pretending to be kind to gain an award. The author then took steps to expose or prevent her from winning. \n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. On one hand, Beck's manipulation is wrong, and the author might feel justified in retaliating. But on the other hand, the author's actions\u2014deliberately trying to stop someone from winning an award and causing them emotional harm\u2014could be seen as unethical. Even if the reason is retaliation, acting on personal vendettas is generally frowned upon. It's a cycle of revenge, which might hurt others and create more problems. \n\nThe author's motivation is understandable given their history of being bullied and then feeling used. But the method of response\u2014interfering with the award process\u2014might not be the right way to handle it. Reporting the manipulation through proper channels would be better than taking matters into one's own hands. \n\nAlso, the consequences: the author is now even more ostracized. The girl is crying, which is a result of the author's actions. So, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response is problematic. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if someone is wronged, the response should ideally be constructive and within ethical boundaries. The author's actions crossed that line. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
