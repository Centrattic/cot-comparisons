Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The question is asking for a judgment between A (yes) and B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's sister has a history of cheating, and the author, knowing this, informed the boyfriend when she found out the sister was cheating again. The boyfriend is a friend of the author. The sister and mom are upset, with the mom even threatening to kick them out, but the dad intervened. The author feels they did the right thing to protect their friend.\n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy, loyalty, and the right to intervene. On one hand, the sister's privacy is a factor. Cheating is a personal matter, and the author stepping in might be seen as overstepping. But on the other hand, the sister's behavior has hurt others before, and the author wanted to prevent further harm to their friend.\n\nThe author's motivation was to protect a friend. They mention the friend was thankful but hurt. The sister's actions are part of a pattern, which might justify the author's intervention. However, the author didn't have the sister's permission to share the information. There's also the aspect of family dynamics here\u2014interfering in a family member's relationship can cause internal conflicts, like the one they're experiencing now.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. Some might argue that the author had a duty to warn the boyfriend, especially since the sister's cheating isn't a one-time thing. Others might say that the author should have tried to address it within the family first, perhaps talking to the sister directly or involving a parent in a different way.\n\nThe consequences are significant: family fallout, with the sister being abusive toward the author. The author stands by their decision, which suggests they believe it was the right thing to do despite the backlash.\n\nI need to weigh the harm caused by the cheating against the harm caused by the author's disclosure. If the boyfriend was indeed being cheated on multiple times, the author's action might have saved him from emotional distress. However, the author's actions led to family tension, which is also harmful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut yes or no. But considering the sister's pattern and the author's intent to protect a friend, some might side with the author. Others might say that the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to disclose that information without the sister's consent.\n\nI think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the intention was to prevent harm, even though it's a sensitive situation. However, there's also the aspect of respecting privacy and family boundaries. But given the sister's history, it's understandable why the author acted. So, leaning towards B.\n"
