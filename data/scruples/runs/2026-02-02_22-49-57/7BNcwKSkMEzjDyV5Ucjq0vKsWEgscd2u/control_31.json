Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister is cheating on her boyfriend, and the author, who is the sister's sibling, told the boyfriend about the cheating. The sister and mom are upset, and there's been some family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the action. The author had the intention to protect their friend (the boyfriend) from being hurt, which is a good intention. But did they overstep by revealing the cheating? Normally, people might think that siblings have a right to privacy, so maybe the author shouldn't have shared that information without the sister's consent. However, the sister's actions (cheating multiple times) might be seen as harmful, and the author felt compelled to intervene to prevent further harm to their friend.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of confidentiality. Siblings might share personal information, but when does it become a breach of trust? If the author wasn't the one who was wronged (the boyfriend was), then maybe they have a moral obligation to the boyfriend as a friend. But at the same time, the sister's privacy is a factor. Cheating is wrong, but others might argue that the sister's actions are her own issue, and the author shouldn't meddle in her relationships.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the boyfriend and sister broke up, and the family is now divided. The author is facing backlash from family members. This might suggest that the action, while well-intentioned, caused significant family disruption. But does that mean the author is wrong? Maybe not necessarily, because they acted to help their friend. However, the sister's right to privacy and the potential breach of trust could be seen as the issue here.\n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the author had the right to disclose the information. If the author wasn't directly involved in the relationship or the cheating, they might not have the authority to reveal such sensitive information. On the other hand, if they witnessed the cheating themselves or had undeniable proof, their actions could be justified as preventing harm.\n\nIn summary, it's a tricky situation. The author's intentions were to protect a friend, which is commendable, but the method of doing so involved revealing a family member's private actions. Depending on cultural norms and personal values, this could be seen as either a justified action or an overstep. However, considering that the sister was cheating and the author was a friend to the boyfriend, some might argue that the author is not in the wrong because they acted to prevent harm to their friend, even if it caused family tension.\n"
