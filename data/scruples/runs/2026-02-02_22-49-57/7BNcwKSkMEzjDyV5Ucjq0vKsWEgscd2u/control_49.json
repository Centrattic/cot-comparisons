Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating on him. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's sister has a history of cheating on boyfriends. The latest boyfriend is a friend from the film society, so there's a prior relationship. The author found out about the cheating and decided to tell the boyfriend to prevent him from getting hurt. \n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy and boundaries. The sister's actions are wrong, but does the author have the right to expose her? The sister's privacy is a factor. Even if she's done something wrong, the author is the one who shared that information without her consent. \n\nThe boyfriend was thankful but hurt. They broke up, and now the sister and mom are angry. The author is facing backlash but doesn't regret the action. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say the author was protecting a friend. Others would argue that the author shouldn't have been the one to disclose someone else's private behavior, especially a family member. There's also the aspect of family dynamics here. The author's parents and sister are upset, which affects the household. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to keep their family's secrets unless there's immediate harm. But in this case, the harm is the ongoing emotional damage to the boyfriend. However, the author's role in this is a bit murky. Did the author have the right to act as a moral authority here? \n\nAlso, the sister's actions are her own, but the author is the one who broke the confidentiality. Even if the sister is wrong, the author's action involved sharing someone else's private information. \n\nSo, depending on the perspective, the author might be seen as in the wrong for violating the sister's privacy, even with good intentions. On the other hand, protecting a friend from being cheated on could be seen as justified. But legally and ethically, sharing such information without consent is usually considered a breach of privacy. \n\nThe answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information about their sister. But I should also consider the context of protecting someone else. However, the consensus might be that the author overstepped their bounds.\n"
