Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating. Hmm. The situation is a bit complicated. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author, who's a sibling, felt the need to protect their friend (the boyfriend) by exposing the cheating. Now the family is upset, especially the mom and sister, and there's tension at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Tattling on a sibling's cheating might be seen as interfering in their relationships. But the author's intention was to help a friend. The question is whether that crosses a boundary. Siblings might have a right to privacy, even if their actions are harmful. On the other hand, the author is trying to prevent someone they care about from getting hurt, which is a noble intention.\n\nBut in terms of moral responsibility, did they overstep? By revealing the cheating, the author broke confidentiality between their sister and her boyfriend. Even if the sister was wrong, the author took it upon themselves to act as a third-party mediator. That could be seen as violating trust within the family. However, the sister's actions were already harmful, so maybe the author had a duty to protect the friend.\n\nThe consequences are significant: family conflict, threats of being kicked out, and ongoing hostility. The author is facing backlash, which is tough. But they don't regret it. The key here is whether the action was justified. If someone is being deceived in a relationship, knowing the truth is important. But the method of disclosure matters. Approaching the boyfriend directly might not be the best approach; maybe advising the sister to end the relationship first would be better, but if she's not listening, then stepping in could be necessary.\n\nIn some cultures or families, loyalty to family is paramount, so the author might be seen as disloyal. However, the author's friend is also part of their social circle, and protecting a friend's well-being could be a valid reason. It's a balance between family loyalty and helping a friend.\n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. From the author's viewpoint, protecting a friend is right. From the family's perspective, it's a betrayal. But ethically, if someone is being cheated on, they have the right to know. The author might not be in the wrong for revealing the truth, even if it caused family issues. However, the author could have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first or seeking advice. But since they did what they thought was right to protect the friend, maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
