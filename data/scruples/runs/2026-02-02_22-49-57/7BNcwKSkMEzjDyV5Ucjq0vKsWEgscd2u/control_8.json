Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has a history of cheating on multiple boyfriends. The author, who used to be friends with her current boyfriend, found out about the cheating and decided to inform the boyfriend to prevent him from getting hurt. Now, the sister and mom are angry, even threatening to kick the author out, and the sister is being cruel to the author. The author doesn't regret their action but is dealing with the fallout.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. Privacy is a big factor here. The sister's cheating is her business, but the author took it upon themselves to share that information with the boyfriend. Even though the intention was to help, the author didn't have the sister's permission to disclose her actions. In many cultures, family matters are considered private, and intervening like this can be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the author might have a personal vendetta against the sister given the description of the sister's behavior. But is that a valid reason? The author's action led to the breakup, which might have been inevitable if the boyfriend found out later, but the method of disclosure could have been handled differently. Maybe confronting the sister first or approaching the boyfriend with more sensitivity.\n\nAnother angle: the author's sister is an adult, and she might have her own reasons for her actions (though cheating is generally frowned upon). The author's intervention could be seen as a breach of trust between siblings. The mother's reaction, though extreme, shows that the family values the sister's privacy and autonomy. The author's decision caused family conflict, which is significant.\n\nOn the flip side, the author's intention was to protect a friend from further harm. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt. It's a tough spot because the author is trying to do the right thing by the boyfriend, but it's not their place to meddle in the sister's relationship. \n\nLegal perspective: There's no legal wrongdoing here, but ethically, it's murky. The author might not be in legal trouble, but socially, they might be seen as violating trust.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a complicated ethical situation. While their intention was good, the action of revealing someone else's cheating without their knowledge could be seen as crossing a boundary. The sister's privacy was invaded, and the author's role as a mediator wasn't appropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong from a familial and ethical standpoint, even if their intention was to help a friend. So the answer would be A.\n"
