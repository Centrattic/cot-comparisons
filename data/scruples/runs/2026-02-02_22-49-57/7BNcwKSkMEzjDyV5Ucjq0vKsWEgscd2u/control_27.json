Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about her cheating. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their sister has cheated on three other boyfriends. The current boyfriend is a friend from their film society days. The author found out about the cheating and decided to inform the boyfriend because they didn't want their friend to get hurt. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt, and they broke up. The sister and mom are angry, with the mom threatening to kick the author out, but the dad stopped that. The author is still facing criticism and personal attacks from the sister, like mocking their weight and gynecomastia. They don't regret their decision.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about privacy and boundaries. The author shared someone else's private information (the sister's cheating) without their consent. Even if the sister's actions were wrong, the author took it upon themselves to act as a judge and inform the boyfriend. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to privacy, even if their behavior is unethical or harmful. The author didn't consult with the sister first, which could have been the right approach if they wanted to address the sister's behavior. However, the sister's actions were harmful to others, so there's a moral argument for protecting the boyfriend from being cheated on.\n\nBut legally and ethically, sharing someone's personal information without their consent can be considered a breach of trust. The author might have acted out of concern for their friend, but they also violated their sister's privacy. It's a tough situation because there are valid points on both sides. The author's intentions were good, but the method of intervention crossed a boundary. \n\nConsidering the consequences, the sister and family are upset, and there's a lot of tension at home. The author's actions led to a breakup and family conflict. Even though the sister was cheating, the author's decision to interfere directly might have been unnecessary. Perhaps a different approach, like advising the boyfriend to confront her or seek evidence himself, could have been better. \n\nSo, while the author's motives were to protect a friend, the act of sharing the information without consent might be seen as the wrong thing to do. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here. However, given the structure of the question, the answer is likely A or B. Since the user is asking for a binary choice, and considering that the action was a breach of privacy despite good intentions, the answer is A.\n"
