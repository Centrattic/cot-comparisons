Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The situation is that the sister has cheated multiple times, and the author, who used to be friends with the boyfriend, decided to inform him. The sister and mom are upset, even threatening to kick the author out, but the author stands by their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Tattling or blowing the whistle might be seen as right if someone is being harmed. The boyfriend was a friend, so the author might feel a duty to protect him. On the other hand, the author didn't get permission from the sister before disclosing that information. That's a breach of privacy. But the sister's actions were harmful, so maybe the author thought it was necessary to prevent further harm.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The sister is being called a slut and has cheated multiple times. The author might have felt the boyfriend had a right to know. However, the author's method of disclosure was a text message, which could be seen as invasive. The sister and mom are upset because they value family trust and loyalty, and the author's action violated that.\n\nBut the author's intention was to prevent a friend from being hurt. The boyfriend was thankful, so maybe the action was justified. However, the author could have considered other ways, like talking to the sister first to try to stop the cheating or getting her to confess. Instead, they went straight to the boyfriend, which might be crossing a line.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if someone is being deceived, the truth should be told. But the method and the person doing the telling matter. The author might not be in the wrong because they prevented harm, but they also acted without the sister's consent. It's a tricky balance. The answer depends on whether the ends justify the means. If the author's action stopped a harmful relationship, maybe it's right. But if they overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy, maybe it's not. The fact that the sister and mom are upset shows a breach of family trust. However, the boyfriend being a friend adds complexity. The author's position is that they did the right thing by the friend, even if it upset the family. So, considering all angles, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they prevented someone from being cheated on, even if the method was questionable.\n"
