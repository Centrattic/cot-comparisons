Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has cheated on multiple partners, and the author, knowing this, informed her current boyfriend, who's a friend of theirs. The family is upset, but the author doesn't regret it.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the sister's cheating history, the author's intention to protect the boyfriend, and the fallout from the family. Legally, maybe there's no wrongdoing, but ethically, it's more complicated. \n\nFirst, the author might have thought they were helping the boyfriend by not letting him get hurt again. But maybe they overstepped by not consulting the sister first. However, the sister was the one cheating, so she might not have wanted to tell him herself. The author's responsibility here is a bit iffy. \n\nOn one hand, the sister's privacy was invaded. She might have felt betrayed by her sibling. The mom's reaction is also about family dynamics. But on the other hand, the boyfriend was being deceived, and the author, as a friend, might have felt compelled to speak up to prevent further harm. \n\nBut wait, did the author have the right to disclose that information? It's personal and sensitive. Even if the sister was cheating, the author isn't the one to decide whether to disclose it. Unless there was some form of consent or prior agreement, the author might have breached confidentiality. \n\nHowever, the sister's actions are unethical, and the boyfriend deserved to know. But the author's role in this is tricky. They could have approached the situation differently, maybe by talking to the sister first to try to discourage the cheating behavior, but instead, they went straight to the boyfriend. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. Legally, maybe not in the wrong, but ethically, there's a gray area. The author might have acted with good intentions but without considering the consequences for their sister and the family dynamics. But the sister's actions were also at fault. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend. But they might have handled it poorly, not considering their sister's privacy and the family's reactions. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister's cheating was the root issue, the author's action might be justified as a protective measure. However, without knowing the full context of their relationship and previous interactions, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a lot of nuance here. So, the answer would be B for No.\n"
