Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that the sister was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt compelled to inform the boyfriend to prevent him from getting hurt. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt, and now the author's sister and mom are angry, even threatening and insulting the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Telling someone that their partner is cheating without their knowledge might be seen as breaching privacy. The sister's boyfriend has a right to know if he's being cheated on, but the author didn't go through the sister first. The sister's actions are wrong, but the author's intervention could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The author's sister is upset because her secret was exposed, leading to family conflict. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting a friend, but family loyalty could argue against it. Also, the author's mom and sister are reacting strongly, which might indicate that the author overstepped in a personal matter.\n\nBut on the other hand, the sister's repeated cheating is a pattern of behavior that's hurting others. The author might feel a duty to prevent further harm. The boyfriend was grateful, which suggests that the author's action had a positive outcome. However, the author could have approached it differently, maybe by talking to the sister first or involving other family members.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to disclose the infidelity without the sister's consent? Is the sister's privacy more important than the boyfriend's right to know? How does family loyalty factor in here? The author's actions led to consequences for the family, but they might believe they were justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to protect a friend, which is commendable, but the method involved sharing personal information without consent, which can be problematic. The sister's privacy was violated, leading to family strife. However, the boyfriend's well-being was also a consideration. \n\nI think the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without the sister's consent, which breaches trust within the family. However, if the argument is that protecting someone from harm justifies the disclosure, then maybe B (not in the wrong). But typically, such decisions are personal, and the author's role as a mediator might not be appropriate here. So leaning towards A, but it's a tough call.\n"
