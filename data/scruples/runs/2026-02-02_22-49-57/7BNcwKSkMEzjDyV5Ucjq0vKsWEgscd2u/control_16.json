Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt compelled to inform the boyfriend to prevent him from getting hurt. Now, the sister and mom are angry, and the author is facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Tattling on a sibling's infidelity might be seen as a breach of trust. The sister's privacy is a factor here. Even if she's done something wrong, the sister has the right to her privacy. The author's intention was to protect a friend, which is understandable, but the method of going behind her back and informing the boyfriend could be problematic. \n\nNext, the relationships involved. The author used to be friends with the boyfriend, so they might feel a duty to protect him. However, the sister is family, and intervening in her relationships could strain family bonds. The mom's reaction and the sister's anger are natural consequences of breaking trust. \n\nLegal aspects? Probably not a legal issue here, but more of a moral one. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" so it's about moral judgment. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe confronting the sister first, trying to get her to confess to the boyfriend on her own. But the author might not have felt that was possible, especially if the sister is in denial or doesn't plan to tell. \n\nThe author doesn't regret their actions, which shows they believe they were justified. However, the fallout is significant, indicating that their actions had serious consequences. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author had to weigh the harm of lying to the boyfriend against the harm of betrayal to the sister. It's a tough call. Some might argue that the boyfriend's right to know is more important, while others might say the sister's privacy and the family trust are paramount. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action was a necessary intervention or an overreach. Since the author didn't consult anyone else first and acted unilaterally, it's likely seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong from a family loyalty perspective, even if their intent was good.\n"
