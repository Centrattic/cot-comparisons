Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend of the author. The author felt bad seeing a friend get hurt and decided to intervene. Now, the family is upset with them.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Telling someone that their partner is cheating is a big decision. On one hand, the author might have good intentions, wanting to protect their friend from being deceived. But on the other hand, they're sharing private information about their sister without her consent. That could be seen as a breach of trust within the family.\n\nBut wait, the sister's actions are harmful. Cheating is a serious issue, and maybe the author felt it was necessary to prevent further harm. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt, which suggests he appreciated knowing the truth, even if it was painful. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to help a friend.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family loyalty. The sister and mother are upset because the author went against family by exposing the sister's behavior. The author's decision might have caused family conflict, which is a downside. But if the sister's actions are a pattern of deceit, maybe the author's action was a justified intervention.\n\nAnother angle: did the author have the right to share that information? Normally, people are expected to keep their family's private matters confidential unless there's a risk of harm. In this case, the boyfriend could be harmed emotionally or psychologically, so the author might argue that preventing harm overrides confidentiality. But others might say it's not the author's place to decide that.\n\nThe sister's reaction, including body shaming, is toxic, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author. The author's actions led to a breakup and family conflict. Even if the sister was cheating, the method of handling it could be questioned. Maybe confronting the sister first or involving another family member would have been a different approach.\n\nBut given the context, the author acted out of concern for a friend. The sister's cheating is a recurring issue, so the author might have felt it was the right thing to do to protect their friend. The outcome was the intended result, even if it caused family tension.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's intentions were to prevent harm to a friend, even though it breached family trust. Depending on cultural or moral views, this could be seen as justified or not. But given that cheating is a significant betrayal, and the author had a history of the sister's deceit, the action might be seen as necessary, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
