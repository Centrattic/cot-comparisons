Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt bad for their friend (who's the sister's current boyfriend) because they used to be in a film club together. The author texted the boyfriend to warn him, and even though the boyfriend was grateful, the sister and mom are really upset, leading to family tension.\n\nHmm, first thing to consider is the concept of privacy. The author is sharing personal information about their sister that isn't their secret to share. Even if the sister is cheating, the author might not have the right to disclose that without her consent. The sister might have a right to privacy, even if her actions are wrong. But then again, the boyfriend has a right to know if he's being cheated on. However, the author stepping in as a third party complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They say they wanted to protect their friend from getting hurt. That's a noble intention, but does that justify the action? Maybe not. Because the author could have talked to their sister first, tried to intervene, or maybe even advised the boyfriend to check for himself. Instead, they just shared the information directly, which might have caused more harm by breaking trust within the family.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the family is now in conflict, the sister is making fun of the author's appearance, and the mom threatened to kick them out. The author might have crossed a line by involving themselves in their sister's relationship without respecting boundaries. Even if the sister is at fault for cheating, the author's action of exposing it without considering the family dynamics might be seen as wrong.\n\nBut then again, if the sister's cheating is a pattern, maybe the author felt it was necessary to prevent ongoing harm. However, the appropriate way might be to talk to their sister first or support the boyfriend through the boyfriend's own channels. The author's role as a sibling is to protect family, but they might have overstepped by sharing private information leading to family discord.\n\nSo, balancing the harm: the boyfriend was hurt but grateful. The sister and family are now hostile. The author's action caused both positive and negative outcomes. But in terms of ethics, is the author wrong? Privacy is a big factor here. Even with good intentions, revealing someone's infidelity without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy and for creating family conflict, even if the intention was good.\n"
