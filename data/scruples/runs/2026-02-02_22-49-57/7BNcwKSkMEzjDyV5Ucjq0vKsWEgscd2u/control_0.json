Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating. \n\nFirst, the user says their sister has a history of cheating, and they felt compelled to tell a friend (the boyfriend) to prevent him from getting hurt. The key points here are the sister's repeated infidelity and the author's intention to protect their friend.\n\nBut wait, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Even if the sister's behavior is problematic, the author is sharing private information without her consent. That's a boundary issue. The author might argue that they were protecting a friend, but is that a valid reason to betray someone's trust?\n\nAlso, the sister and the mother are upset, which suggests that the author overstepped. The author's actions led to the breakup, which is a significant consequence. Even if the intention was good, the method of intervention (without the sister's knowledge) might be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister's cheating is a pattern, maybe there's a legitimate concern for the boyfriend's well-being. But usually, the responsibility to address infidelity lies with the person involved, not a third party. The author's role as a sibling might give them some insight, but they might not be the best person to act as a mediator or informant.\n\nAnother angle: privacy and consent. The author didn't ask the sister or the boyfriend if it was okay to share such personal details. Even if the sister has a history of cheating, each relationship is the couple's responsibility. The author's action could be seen as meddling in a relationship that's none of their business beyond being a friend to the boyfriend.\n\nHowever, the author is a family member, and family dynamics can be complex. The sister's behavior might be harmful, and the author might genuinely want to protect their friend. But the method of intervention is where the problem lies. It's possible that the author should have tried to talk to their sister first, maybe set boundaries, or encouraged her to own up to her actions rather than directly informing the boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, sharing someone else's private information without consent can be a violation of their privacy. Unless there's a legal obligation (like in cases of harm to a minor or imminent danger), the author might be overstepping. The sister's actions, while morally wrong, don't necessarily justify the author's disclosure.\n\nThe fallout in the family is significant, with threats of being kicked out and ongoing tension. This suggests that the author's decision had serious consequences, which might not have been fully considered beforehand. The author's justification is based on protecting a friend, but the means used (without consent) could be seen as wrong regardless of intent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they violated their sister's privacy and the trust within the family without following proper channels. They should have perhaps addressed the issue with their sister first or found another way to support their friend without directly intervening in the relationship.\n"
