Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, the key points here are the sister's cheating history, the author's intent to protect their friend, and the fallout with family.\n\nFirst, the sister has cheated on three boyfriends, which the author knew about. The current boyfriend is an old friend of the author. The author found out the sister was cheating on him and told him directly. The reason given was to prevent the friend from getting hurt. The boyfriend appreciated the information, even though he was hurt, and they broke up. Now the sister and mom are furious, calling the author names and causing family tension.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose the sister's infidelity without her consent. On one hand, the author might argue that they were protecting their friend from being cheated on again, given the sister's pattern. On the other hand, privacy is a big concern here. The sister's actions are wrong, but the author's disclosure could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nEthically, there's a debate. Some might say that the author did the right thing by preventing harm to their friend. Others might argue that it's none of their business and that they should have handled it differently, like talking directly to the sister or not interfering at all. The author's actions led to family conflict, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nAlso, the sister's response is aggressive, which might indicate guilt or anger. The author's justification is about protecting a friend, which is understandable. However, the method of disclosure\u2014telling the boyfriend directly\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially if there wasn't a direct threat and the author didn't consult the sister first.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tricky situation. Legally, unless there's a duty to report, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But morally, it's a gray area. The author's intent was to help, but the means might be questionable. Depending on the culture and family dynamics, the answer could vary. However, generally, people might side with the author if they believe the sister's cheating is a recurring harmful pattern and the author acted to protect a friend. But others might say that the author should have handled it in a different way, not by exposing the sister's actions to the boyfriend.\n"
