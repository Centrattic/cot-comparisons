Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that the sister is cheating. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend of the author. The author felt bad for the friend and decided to inform him. Now, the sister and mom are upset, and there's family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Telling someone about their partner's infidelity isn't typically considered a betrayal if the partner is unfaithful, but it does involve sharing private information. The sister and mom are angry, which suggests there's a breach of trust from their perspective. The sister has a history of cheating, so maybe the author thought it was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be protecting a friend from being cheated on again. On the other hand, the author didn't get the sister's consent to share her private actions. Family dynamics are involved here\u2014maybe the author overstepped by not handling it within the family first. \n\nLegal-wise, there's no law against this, but morally, it's about trust and boundaries. The author might have broken their sister's trust, which is why the family is upset. However, the sister's actions (cheating) are also problematic. The author might feel justified in protecting their friend. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Since it's their sister, there's a family expectation of privacy. Unless the sister was harming someone directly, the author's action could be seen as violating that privacy. But since the sister was indeed cheating, the author's intent was to prevent further harm to the boyfriend. \n\nIt's a tough call. Some might say the author did the right thing to protect a friend, others might say it's meddling in family affairs without permission. The key points are consent, intent, and consequences. The author's intent was to help a friend, which is a good motive. The consequences led to the breakup, which might be seen as a positive outcome for the boyfriend, but the sister and family feel wronged. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister's cheating is her fault, but the author's disclosure might still be considered an overreach. So, depending on cultural or personal beliefs, the answer can vary. However, in many ethical frameworks, the author might be seen as having crossed a line by not respecting their sister's privacy, even with good intentions.\n"
