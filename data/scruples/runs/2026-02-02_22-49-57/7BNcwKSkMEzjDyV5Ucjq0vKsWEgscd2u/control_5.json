Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend of the author. The author felt bad seeing their friend get hurt, so they spilled the beans. Now the sister and mom are angry, even threatening to kick them out and saying mean things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and boundaries. The sister's actions are wrong, but the author took it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend without the sister's consent. Even if the intention was good\u2014to protect a friend\u2014it's a breach of privacy. Cheating is a personal issue, and the sister has the right to handle her own relationships. By stepping in, the author might have overstepped. Family members often don't have the right to interfere in another's romantic life without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is harmful, and the boyfriend was being deceived. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by revealing the truth. But the key here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister's privacy doesn't end with her cheating; others still have a right to their privacy. Unless there was a legal obligation (like abuse, which isn't mentioned here), the author shouldn't have shared that info without consent.\n\nAlso, the fallout is significant. The family is upset, and the author is being harassed. This shows that the action disrupted family dynamics and caused harm. Even if the intention was good, the consequences are severe. The author should have perhaps talked to their sister first, maybe tried to convince her to be honest with the boyfriend, rather than taking the direct approach of informing him themselves.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely overstepped by sharing private information without consent, leading to conflict. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. But there's a moral argument that cheating is wrong, and the author was trying to prevent harm. However, legally and ethically, sharing someone's private actions without their consent is a breach of privacy. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
