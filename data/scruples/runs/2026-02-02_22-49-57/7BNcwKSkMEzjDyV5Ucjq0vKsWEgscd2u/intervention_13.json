Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend was a friend of the author. The author felt bad seeing their friend get hurt, so they came forward. The sister and mom are upset, and the author is facing backlash but still doesn't regret the action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is a family member, and revealing someone's infidelity without their consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, the sister's actions are harmful, and the author might have had good intentions to protect the boyfriend. \n\nOn one hand, the author is defending someone they care about (the friend) from being hurt. That could be seen as a moral act. On the other hand, the author didn't get the sister's permission to share that information, which is a violation of privacy and trust within the family. The sister might have her own reasons for the infidelity, and the author's intervention could have contributed to the breakup and the family conflict.\n\nBut cheating is generally considered wrong, and the sister's repeated behavior might justify the author's action. The boyfriend was a friend, so the author had a personal stake in their well-being. However, the author's methods might not be the best approach. Instead of directly telling the boyfriend, maybe they could have advised the sister to be honest or offered support to the boyfriend without exposing the sister's secret.\n\nThe family's reaction is intense, with threats and name-calling. That's a red flag for a toxic environment, but it doesn't necessarily make the author right. The key question is whether the author overstepped their bounds. In most cases, people are expected to keep their family's private matters confidential unless there's a compelling reason to disclose. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to prevent harm to their friend, which is a valid concern. However, the decision to act as a third-party intervener in a romantic relationship is a gray area. \n\nIn some cultures or contexts, protecting a loved one from betrayal is seen as noble. In others, it's a violation of privacy and autonomy. Without knowing the specific cultural norms, it's hard to say, but generally, the act of revealing such information without consent is often considered a breach of trust, even if the intent was good. The sister has the right to address her own relationship issues, and the author's interference might have deprived the boyfriend of the opportunity to confront the situation himself, maybe leading to personal growth. \n\nBut the boyfriend was grateful, which suggests that the author's action did help him avoid further pain. The sister's cheating is a pattern, so the author might believe they were saving the boyfriend from more hurt. However, the fallout within the family has been severe, indicating that the author's action had significant consequences beyond just the relationship.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be seen as protective and well-meaning, the act of disclosing private information without consent is ethically questionable. The wrongness depends on the balance between the intent to help and the breach of privacy. Since the sister's behavior is harmful, but the author's method of intervention caused family discord, it's a complex situation. However, based on typical ethical standards, the author might be in the wrong for violating privacy even if the motive was good.\n"
