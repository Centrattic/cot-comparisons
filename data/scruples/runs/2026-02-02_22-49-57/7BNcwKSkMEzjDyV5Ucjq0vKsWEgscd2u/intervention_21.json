Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has cheated on multiple boyfriends, including the current one. The author, being friends with the boyfriend, decided to inform him about the cheating to protect him from getting hurt. Now, the sister and their mom are angry, and the author is facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Telling someone their partner is cheating is a form of confidentiality breach. The sister's boyfriend had a right to know, but the author isn't in a position to mediate that. However, the sister's actions are clearly wrong, but the author's intervention might have been well-intentioned. \n\nOn one hand, the author's motive was to protect a friend from emotional harm, which is a noble intention. On the other hand, they didn't consult the sister first, which is a privacy issue. The sister might have had her reasons for her actions, but the author's action was crossing a line into her personal life. \n\nLegal perspective: In some places, there might be laws about interfering in someone else's relationships, but I think that's more about physical interference. Here, it's about revealing information. But ethically, it's a gray area. \n\nThe author is being blamed by their family, which is understandable since they violated trust. The sister's cheating is her fault, but the author taking it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend might not be their responsibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The right to know is on the boyfriend's side, but the method of disclosure might be inappropriate. The author didn't have the authority to reveal that information. Even if the intention was good, the action could be seen as meddling in the sister's private affairs without her consent. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they crossed a boundary by sharing sensitive information without permission, even if the intention was to help. However, some might argue B because protecting a friend from harm is justified. But ethically, it's a violation of trust, so A is more likely.\n"
