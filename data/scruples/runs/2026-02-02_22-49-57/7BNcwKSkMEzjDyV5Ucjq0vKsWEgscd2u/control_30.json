Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, there's the sister who has a history of cheating. The author, who used to know the boyfriend, found out about the cheating and decided to inform him. The sister and mom are upset, and the author is facing backlash. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider different angles. On one hand, the author might have been trying to protect a friend from getting hurt. They didn't know about the sister's past cheatings, but since they knew her pattern, they felt compelled to act. On the other hand, the sister's privacy is a factor. Even if she's done something wrong, the author might have overstepped by not discussing it with her first.\n\nBut wait, the sister's cheatings are a matter of concern. The author's intention was to help the boyfriend, which is understandable. However, without knowing if the sister had changed her behavior, the author's action could be seen as crossing a boundary. They didn't talk to the sister first, so there's a lack of communication there. Also, the sister's privacy and the family dynamics play a role here. The mom and sister's reactions are strong, but does that mean the author was wrong?\n\nIn some perspectives, if someone has a pattern of cheating, others might feel justified in intervening. But others might argue that it's not the author's place to interfere, and that the boyfriend should have discovered the cheating on his own. Also, the consequences for the author are significant, which adds to the emotional weight.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust within the family. By not keeping the sister's secret, the author might have damaged relationships. But if the sister's behavior is harmful, maybe the author did the right thing despite the fallout.\n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong here. However, the author might have acted without considering their sister's side of the story. Maybe they should have tried to mediate or talk to the sister first. But given the sister's history, the author's concern was valid. So, perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there could be room for improvement in how they handled it.\n"
