They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and there's some confusion about the size of the house. The key points here are the terms of the service and the expectations both parties had.\n\nFirst, the user didn't list the actual number of bedrooms and bathrooms because they wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. They manipulated the input in the app to get a 4-hour booking instead of a longer one. The cleaner, upon arriving, finished the downstairs in 90 minutes and then went upstairs, but when shown the additional rooms, he got angry because the actual house size was larger than what was listed. The user told him not to worry about the upstairs unless there's time, but the cleaner still felt wronged.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the user misrepresented the house's size. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the required hours. By providing false information, the user might have led the cleaner to believe that the house was smaller than it actually is. The cleaner's contract or service agreement likely includes cleaning all the listed areas for the quoted time. If the user didn't list the real number of rooms, the cleaner might not be obligated to clean beyond what was expected based on the initial info.\n\nBut the user also told the cleaner directly that the priority was the downstairs and that he could do the upstairs only if there was time. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling misled by the initial listing, even if the user clarified upon arrival. The problem is whether the user's manipulation of the app's form constitutes a breach of the service agreement. If the app calculates hours based on room count, then the user's false input could be considered deceptive, leading to an unfair service arrangement. The cleaner might have been under the impression that the house was smaller and thus could handle the job in the quoted time, but upon realizing it's bigger, he feels exploited. \n\nHowever, the user did clarify at the start that the focus was downstairs and the upstairs was optional. The cleaner's reaction might be about the discrepancy between the initial listing and the actual house size, but the user's verbal instructions could override the initial listing. Still, the app's system was designed to calculate hours based on the room count, so the user's manipulation might have been a way to get a cheaper rate by understating the house's size. That could be seen as dishonest, even if the verbal explanation was clear. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user's actions in manipulating the app's form to get a lower price while knowing the house is larger might be the root of the issue. The cleaner's contract might rely on the accuracy of the user's inputs. Even if the user verbally adjusted the expectations, the initial false information could be grounds for the cleaner feeling misled. The cleaner's anger is probably because the user didn't list the house accurately, leading to a potential imbalance in the service for the price paid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user's manipulation of the app's room count to secure a 4-hour booking instead of a longer one, knowing the house is bigger, could be seen as deceptive. Even if the verbal instructions were clear, the initial false representation might still be the issue. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not providing accurate information through the app's system, which the cleaner relies on for their service scope.\n"
