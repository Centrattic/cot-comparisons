They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and during the sign-up process, they had to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the cleaning time. The user intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a 4-hour window, intending for the cleaner to focus on the downstairs areas. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the additional rooms, he got upset because the actual number was higher than listed.\n\nThe user's argument is that they only needed the downstairs cleaned and didn't want to pay extra. They informed the cleaner at the start that the priority was downstairs and that any time left could be used for upstairs. The cleaner, however, was angry about the discrepancy in the listed rooms versus the actual number, even though the user clarified their instructions upon arrival.\n\nNow, considering the terms of service of the app. Most such platforms require accurate input to estimate the required time and labor. By misrepresenting the house's size, the user might have breached the app's terms, leading to an underpayment for the cleaner's work. The cleaner likely expected to clean the number of rooms listed, and the user's underreporting could be seen as an attempt to get more service for less money. Even if the user clarified the instructions, the contract was based on false premises. The cleaner's anger stems from feeling misled, which is a valid reaction if the app's pricing is tied to the listed rooms. The user's responsibility here is to provide accurate information to ensure fair compensation for the service. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house's size, which is a fundamental part of the service agreement.\n"
