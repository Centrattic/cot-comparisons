They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of rooms determines the hours. The user intentionally underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaning job, but the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset when shown the upstairs, saying it wasn't what was listed.\n\nFirst, the key points: The user used an app that calculates hours based on the number of rooms. They lied about the house size to get a shorter cleaning time. The cleaner was supposed to clean the downstairs, and the user told him he didn't have to finish the upstairs. However, the cleaner got angry because the actual number of rooms was higher than listed.\n\nNow, considering the terms of service. If the app's system is designed so that the number of rooms directly affects the time allocated, then the user's intentional misrepresentation might be a breach of the service's rules. The cleaner was likely expecting to clean a certain number of rooms for the 4 hours, but the user's house had more, which would take longer. The user paid for a specific amount of time based on a false premise, so the cleaner might feel they were underpaid given the actual work required.\n\nThe user's argument is that they didn't want the cleaner to work on the upstairs, and the cleaner was supposed to leave after 4 hours. However, the cleaner's frustration comes from the discrepancy between what was listed and the actual house size. Even if the user said \"as much as you can,\" the cleaner might have expected to be paid for a full 4-hour job based on the initial room count. The user essentially got the cleaner to work on more rooms without paying for the additional time that the app would have allocated if the true room count was given.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user manipulated the system to get a lower price, which could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner's time and effort for the actual work done might not align with the compensation received. The user might be in the wrong for not being transparent, even if the intention was to save money and only clean the downstairs. The cleaner's anger is justified if the service agreement was based on the room count, and the user is now expecting the cleaner to work extra without compensation.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the user is in the wrong. They misrepresented the house size, leading to a situation where the cleaner did more work than anticipated for the same pay, which breaches the terms of the service and is ethically questionable.\n"
