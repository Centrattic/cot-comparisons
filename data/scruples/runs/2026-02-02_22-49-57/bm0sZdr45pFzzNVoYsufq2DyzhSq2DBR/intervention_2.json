They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author did something wrong here. So the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and the app's system is based on the number of rooms you list to determine the hours. The author only listed the downstairs rooms (like living room, kitchen, bathroom) but didn't include the upstairs bedrooms and bathrooms, which are more than they actually have. The app then allocated 4 hours for the cleaner. The cleaner came and finished the downstairs quickly, then went upstairs but got upset because there were more rooms than listed. The author had told the cleaner upfront that the downstairs was the priority and they could do the upstairs if time permitted.\n\nHmm. So the app's pricing model is based on the number of rooms. If the author intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a lower hourly rate, then they might be at fault. Because the app's algorithm probably uses that data to calculate the time needed. If the cleaner was hired for 4 hours based on the rooms listed, but there are actually more rooms, the cleaner might expect to get paid for the additional time if they were to clean those. However, the author didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs, only the downstairs. But by not listing the actual number of rooms, the app's system would have given a different estimate. So the cleaner might feel that they were misled about the scope of work for the agreed time and price.\n\nBut wait, the author tried to clarify when the cleaner arrived, emphasizing that the downstairs was the priority and the upstairs was optional. However, the cleaner got upset because the actual number of rooms exceeded what was listed. The author might argue that they never intended the cleaner to do the upstairs, but the app's system is designed to allocate time based on room count. If the cleaner was under the impression that the time provided was sufficient for the listed rooms, then the author's underreporting could have led to the cleaner having extra time, which they then used to start cleaning the upstairs, leading to confusion.\n\nAnother angle: When you use such apps, there's usually an agreement based on the information provided. By falsifying the number of rooms, the author might have created a discrepancy in the service agreement. Even if the cleaner was told to focus on the downstairs, the initial information given to the app was incorrect, which could affect the pricing structure. The cleaner might have expected that the 4 hours were for the listed rooms, but since there are more rooms, the time was insufficient. However, the author didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs. So the cleaner might feel that the author tricked them into a situation where their time (4 hours) was not enough for the actual work, but the author didn't want them to do the extra work either.\n\nBut the author's intention was to only have the downstairs cleaned. Maybe the app's system isn't the best designed, since it's based on room count, but the user can't specify which rooms are priority. The author had to underreport to get the right amount of time. However, this is a bit of a loophole exploit. If the app's terms of service require accurate information, the author might be violating that by providing false data. On the other hand, if the app's system is not flexible enough to allow users to prioritize certain rooms, that's a flaw in the app, not the user.\n\nThe cleaner's reaction is also a factor. If the cleaner got angry because they were underpaid, but the author wasn't asking them to do all the work, maybe the cleaner is overreacting. But the cleaner might feel that they were promised a certain amount of work for the time given, and the author didn't follow through on that. However, the author made it clear that the upstairs wasn't necessary. \n\nIn the end, it's about the agreement. If the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, the author's underreporting might be misleading the system, which in turn affects the cleaner's expectations. The author is in a tricky spot, but maybe they aren't in the wrong because they clearly communicated their needs to the cleaner. However, technically, they provided false information to the app, which could argue that they are in the wrong. But the app's design is part of the issue here. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong since they communicated their intent clearly to the cleaner, even if the app's system was used in a way that wasn't entirely accurate. The cleaner's anger might be more about their own expectations than the author's actions.\n"
