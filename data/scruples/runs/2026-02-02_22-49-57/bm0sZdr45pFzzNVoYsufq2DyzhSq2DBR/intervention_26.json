They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by underreporting the size of their house when hiring a cleaner through an app. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the cleaning time. The author only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and didn't list all the upstairs rooms, which led to the cleaner being upset when he had time left and went upstairs.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the discrepancy between the listed number of rooms and the actual number. The app is designed to calculate the hours based on the inputs, so if the user inputs fewer rooms, the app gives a lower hour estimate. The author's intention was to only have the cleaner focus on the downstairs, but the cleaner ended up with extra time and went upstairs, which the user hadn't accounted for in the initial listing.\n\nThe user argues that they made it clear to the cleaner that the downstairs was the priority and that he could do the upstairs if he had time. However, the cleaner felt misled because the actual number of rooms wasn't listed. The app's system is based on the user's input, so if the user provides inaccurate information, the system can't account for it. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't input the correct number, leading the cleaner to expect a certain amount of work. But the user also communicated the priority areas upon arrival, which the cleaner might not have followed if he had known about the extra rooms.\n\nBut wait, the user's defense is that the cleaner was supposed to do the downstairs completely and then do as much of the upstairs as possible. The cleaner might have felt that the time given wasn't enough for the entire house, but the user had input fewer rooms, leading to less time. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that his work was undervalued or that the user tricked him. However, the user's intention was to save money by not paying for unnecessary hours. \n\nIn terms of contractual obligations, the app's terms might require the user to list the actual number of rooms. If the user lied, even if it was to control the cleaner's time, it's a misrepresentation. On the other hand, the user did communicate the actual priorities on the day of the cleaning. The cleaner's job might be to clean the listed areas, but the user didn't list all areas, leading to a conflict. \n\nThe key points are: the user misrepresented the number of rooms, leading to a lower quote, but then expected the cleaner to use the remaining time for unlisted areas. The cleaner might feel that the user is trying to get more work for less money, which is unethical. However, the user might feel that the cleaner should have followed their instructions despite the initial listing. \n\nConsidering standard practices, when you use a service like an app that asks for room numbers to determine time, providing accurate info is essential. The user's misrepresentation could be seen as misleading the system and the cleaner. Even if they clarified the priorities, the initial listing was false. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they provided incorrect information to get a lower rate, which affected the cleaner's expectations.\n"
