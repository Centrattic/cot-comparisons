They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms listed. The user intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a 4-hour cleaner, thinking that the cleaner would only need to focus on the downstairs areas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, then the user provided false information. The cleaner was probably expecting to handle a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms. By not listing all the rooms, the user might have misled the service into providing a cleaner for a time that's insufficient for the actual work, even if they didn't use all the time.\n\nHowever, the user clearly communicated upon the cleaner's arrival that the priority was the downstairs, and that the cleaner could do as much upstairs as time allowed. The cleaner finished the main areas quickly and then had extra time. The problem arises when the cleaner was shown the additional rooms and became upset about the discrepancy in the reported rooms.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they might not have intended for the cleaner to do all the upstairs work, just to use the remaining time. But the cleaner felt that the initial information was incorrect, which might have led to an expectation that the cleaner would handle all listed rooms. If the app's agreement states that the listed rooms must be cleaned, then the user might be in the wrong for not being accurate. However, if the app's terms only require the cleaner to work for the agreed time and handle the listed rooms, but the user can choose to not use all the time or focus on certain areas, then the user is within their rights.\n\nThe cleaner's reaction is a key point. If the cleaner felt misled because the user didn't list all rooms, that's a problem because the app probably uses that info to determine the job's scope. The user's explanation after the fact that the upstairs wasn't necessary might not change the cleaner's perception of being misled. The user's intent was to save money by underreporting, which could be seen as unethical or deceptive, even if the cleaner ended up with extra time.\n\nIn terms of legal or contractual obligations, if the service contract requires the listed rooms to be cleaned, the user is in the wrong. If it's a time-based service where the hours are calculated based on room count but the user can adjust the focus, then it's more nuanced. The user's actions could be seen as exploiting a system designed for a different purpose, leading to a mismatch in expectations.\n\nConsidering both sides, the user might be in the wrong for providing inaccurate information to manipulate the service's pricing and expectations, even if the outcome was beneficial. The cleaner's anger stems from the discrepancy between the listed rooms and the actual work, which might have affected their compensation or workload expectations.\n"
