They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where you list the number of rooms (bedrooms and bathrooms) to determine the service time. They intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when shown the upstairs areas, feeling misled. The user argues that they only needed the downstairs cleaned and that the cleaner was supposed to do as much as possible within the time.\n\nFirst, the key point is whether misrepresenting the size of the house to get a lower service time is acceptable. The app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the number of rooms, so the user's manipulation of that system could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner likely expected to clean the listed number of rooms, but the user added more rooms later. The user's instruction to the cleaner about focusing on downstairs was after the fact, which might not align with the cleaner's expectations based on the initial listing.\n\nThe user's defense is that they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs, but by not listing all the rooms, they set up a situation where the cleaner might feel undercompensated for the time. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that the user tricked them into taking a job that wasn't accurately described. Even though the user offered the cleaner to do upstairs if time allowed, the initial misrepresentation might be the cleaner's main issue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user's action was to mislead the cleaner by not providing accurate information required for the service. If the app's terms state that the listed rooms are the ones to be cleaned, then the user violated that agreement. However, if the app's process is just an estimate and the final agreement is between the user and the cleaner, the user might have more leeway. The user's confusion about the app's strictness on room listing adds complexity. The cleaner's attitude is unprofessional, but the user's initial deception might be the root cause of the conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the user might be in the wrong for misrepresenting the house size, even if their intention was to save money. The cleaner's reaction is valid because the user didn't accurately represent the job's scope. The user's explanation after the cleaner arrived doesn't negate the initial misrepresentation. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the user being in the wrong.\n"
