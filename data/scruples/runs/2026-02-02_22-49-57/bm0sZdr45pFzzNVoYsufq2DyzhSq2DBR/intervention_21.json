They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author made a mistake by lying about the size of their house when hiring a cleaner through an app.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to hire a cleaner for a specific number of hours, so they manipulated the app's input (number of bedrooms/bathrooms) to get a 4-hour estimate instead of the actual required time. The cleaner arrived, finished downstairs quickly, and then got upset when shown the upstairs areas, feeling misled. The author explained that the upstairs wasn't necessary and the cleaner only needed to work the paid hours. The cleaner was still angry and the author is considering a complaint.\n\nNow, considering the terms of service of the app. Most such services likely require users to input accurate information because the pricing and time estimates are based on that. By falsifying the number of rooms, the author potentially violated the app's terms. This could lead to disputes since the cleaner was booked for a time based on incorrect data. The cleaner might feel entitled to additional pay or that their work is incomplete if the house isn't fully cleaned as per the listed areas.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to only pay for cleaning the downstairs. The cleaner was told upfront that the priority was the downstairs and to do what they could with the upstairs. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling their time was undervalued or not compensated for the full scope of work implied by the initial listing.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author could be in the wrong for not providing accurate information, which the app uses to determine service duration. The cleaner might have a valid complaint if the service agreement was based on the listed house size. On the other hand, the author clearly communicated their needs upon the cleaner's arrival, so the cleaner might have been aware of the actual task. But the initial misrepresentation is key here. The cleaner's contract would be based on the app's algorithm, which relies on accurate inputs. If the app's terms require accurate information, the author violated those by lying, which could lead to disputes over the service's terms. The cleaner might not be bound to clean the entire house if the terms were based on a smaller size, but the author's misrepresentation is the root issue. The cleaner's reaction might be justified if they felt misled into working for less pay than they should have received for the actual job size. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not providing accurate information, which is a fundamental part of the service agreement.\n"
