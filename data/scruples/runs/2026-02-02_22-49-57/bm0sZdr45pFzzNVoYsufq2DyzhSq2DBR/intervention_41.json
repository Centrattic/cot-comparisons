They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to get the hours, but the author lied about the size to get a 4-hour service instead of more. The cleaner ended up with extra time after finishing the downstairs and got upset when there were more rooms upstairs than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The app's system is based on the number of rooms determining the hours. The author intentionally underreported the rooms to get a cheaper, shorter service. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then discovered there were more rooms. The author told the cleaner not to worry about finishing the upstairs, but the cleaner was angry.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author lied about the house size, which led to the cleaner having extra time but being paid for less. The cleaner might feel they were misled because the app's pricing is based on the information provided. If the app's terms require accurate input, then the author violated that. However, the author's intention was to only have the cleaner focus on the downstairs, which they emphasized. The cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms, but the author didn't list them all, so the cleaner's expectation was based on incomplete info.\n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, when you use an app that asks for specific details to calculate the service, providing false information could be a breach of terms. The cleaner might argue they were promised a certain workload for the hours they were scheduled. However, the author's intention was to not have the cleaner do the upstairs, and they made that clear upon arrival. The cleaner's anger might stem from the discrepancy between what they expected based on the app (hours for listed rooms) and the actual work done (more rooms than listed but not all cleaned).\n\nThe author could be in the wrong if the app's terms require accurate room counts. But if the app's system is just a guideline and the actual service is flexible based on the client's instructions, then maybe the author isn't at fault. The cleaner's attitude is also a factor\u2014the author might not be entirely responsible if the cleaner's reaction is unreasonable. But the initial deception about the room count is a red flag. The author could have communicated their needs differently without lying. So, there's a mix here. The answer might hinge on the app's policies and whether the author's actions were a breach, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the ethical angle, lying to get a lower price might be seen as dishonest, even if the intention was to save money. So leaning towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
