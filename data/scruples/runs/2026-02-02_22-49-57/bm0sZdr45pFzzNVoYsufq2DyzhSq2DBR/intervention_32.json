They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to get an hour estimate. They lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour booking, intending for the cleaner to only clean the downstairs, which they needed more thoroughly. The cleaner finished downstairs quickly and was upset about the upstairs being more than listed.\n\nFirst, the terms of the service. The app likely uses the room count to estimate time required, so not providing accurate info could mislead the cleaner. The cleaner probably expected to clean all listed rooms within the 4 hours, but the user only wanted partial cleaning. The user said \"he can do as much as he has time for,\" but the cleaner might feel it's their responsibility to clean all areas listed. \n\nLegally or ethically, if the contract (even implicit) was based on room count, the user misrepresented the job. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed rooms, so finishing early but not cleaning all could be a problem. However, the user's intention was to prioritize certain areas. The cleaner's anger might come from unmet expectations or feeling the user manipulated the system. \n\nThe user's defense is that they only needed the downstairs, but the app's structure is based on total rooms. So the user's mistake was in providing incorrect data, leading the cleaner to expect a job that was smaller than the actual house. The user might not be in the wrong if the app allows flexibility, but if the app's terms require accurate info, then the user did something wrong. Also, the cleaner's job might be to clean all listed rooms, so the user didn't get their money's worth. \n\nBut the user clearly communicated the priority at the start, which the cleaner didn't follow. The cleaner might be in the wrong for not adhering to the user's instructions. However, the initial misrepresentation of room count could still be an issue. It's a bit of a gray area. The user might not be in the wrong if the app's terms don't strictly enforce room count accuracy, but if the app requires accurate info for proper scheduling, then the user is at fault. The main point is the discrepancy between what was listed and the actual house size, leading to a misunderstanding. The user's responsibility is to provide accurate info for the service to be booked correctly. So, the answer might lean towards A (user in the wrong) because they lied about the room count, leading to an unfair expectation for the cleaner.\n"
