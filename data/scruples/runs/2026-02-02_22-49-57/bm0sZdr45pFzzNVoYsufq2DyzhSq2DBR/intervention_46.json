They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of rooms determines the hours. The user lied about the number of rooms to get a shorter cleaning time, intending to only have the cleaner focus on the downstairs. However, the cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, becoming upset when there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's pricing structure is based on the number of rooms, then accurately listing that information is crucial for the cleaner's expectations. The user knowingly provided false information, which might have led to the cleaner expecting a certain amount of work for that time. The cleaner might feel misled because they were promised a certain workload based on the listed rooms, and now there's more work than anticipated.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention was to have the cleaner focus on the downstairs, and they communicated this upon arrival. The user also emphasized that the cleaner didn't have to finish everything upstairs. The real issue might be the app's system that ties room count to hours, which the user manipulated to get a cheaper rate but ended up creating a misunderstanding.\n\nThe cleaner's reaction could stem from feeling that the user tricked them into a service agreement that wasn't honored. Even though the user tried to clarify later, the initial deception might have caused the cleaner to invest time expecting a certain scope, which wasn't met. However, since the user paid for the agreed hours and the cleaner had the discretion to work on upstairs areas if time allowed, maybe the user isn't at fault. But the cleaner's frustration is valid because the terms they accepted were based on inaccurate information.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? The manipulation of the app's system to get a lower rate by lying about the house size is ethically questionable. Even if the user intended to only clean part of the house, the cleaner's expectation was set by the provided room count. The user might have breached the implicit contract by not being truthful upfront. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's a nuance where the app's system design could contribute to the misunderstanding. However, the user's action of lying is the root cause here, making them at fault.\n"
