They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is that the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the actual rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner arrived, finished quickly, then went upstairs and got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author told the cleaner that only the downstairs was important and he could do as much as time allowed. The cleaner was upset about the discrepancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's system is designed so that the number of rooms directly affects the estimated hours, then not providing accurate info could be an issue. The app's algorithm likely assumes a standard time per room. By underreporting, the author might have misled the system into allocating fewer hours than necessary for the actual space. \n\nThen, when the cleaner arrived, the author verbally clarified the focus areas. But the cleaner was still upset because the discrepancy in the listed rooms versus the actual number made him feel like he was underpaid or that the job was misrepresented. The key point here is whether the app's service agreement requires the user to list accurate information. If the user intentionally provided false info to get a lower price, that could be unethical or a breach of terms.\n\nAlso, from the cleaner's perspective, he was sent for a specific job based on the listed rooms. Even if the author verbally adjusted the scope, the initial contract (based on the app's calculation) might have been based on the false data. The cleaner could feel that he was promised a job for a certain number of rooms, but actually found more, which wasn't accounted for in the payment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to prioritize the downstairs and was clear upon arrival. They might not have realized that the app's calculation is strict. But the problem is that the system relies on accurate input to determine the service. The author's manipulation of the input could be seen as deceptive, even if their intention was to save money. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the app requires accurate input to calculate the service, then the author misrepresented the job, leading to a situation where the cleaner had to work more than anticipated for the same pay. That seems unfair to the cleaner. Even though the author tried to adjust expectations upon arrival, the initial false information is the root of the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they provided misleading information to the service, which affected the terms of the job.\n"
