They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the house size when hiring a cleaner. \n\nSo the situation is the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of rooms, which determines the hours. The author didn't list the actual number of rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown more rooms, the cleaner got angry because the house was bigger than listed.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they only needed the cleaner for the time allocated, and they told the cleaner not to feel pressured about the upstairs. The cleaner, however, was upset about the discrepancy.\n\nHmm. When you use an app like that, the terms are usually based on the information you provide. The app's pricing model is probably based on the square footage or number of rooms. If the user lied about the number to get a cheaper rate, the cleaner's time might be calculated based on that. The cleaner might have expected to clean a certain number of rooms for the given hours. If the house is bigger, maybe the cleaner feels underpaid because their time was based on an incomplete listing. \n\nBut the author did clarify that the priority was the downstairs and the cleaner could do the upstairs if time allowed. The problem is the expectation mismatch. The cleaner might have calculated the workload based on the listed rooms, so when there are more, they feel it's unfair. On the other hand, the author paid for a specific duration and told the cleaner not to feel obligated to finish everything. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the app's terms require accurate input, then the author didn't follow the service's guidelines. But if the contract was just the hours, maybe the author is okay because they paid for the time. However, the cleaner's wage might depend on the number of rooms. If the cleaner was paid less than what the job should have cost, then the author underpaid them. \n\nSo the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they provided false information to get a lower price, leading to an unfair situation where the cleaner's labor might be undercompensated for the actual work required. The cleaner's anger is about being misled about the job's scope.\n"
