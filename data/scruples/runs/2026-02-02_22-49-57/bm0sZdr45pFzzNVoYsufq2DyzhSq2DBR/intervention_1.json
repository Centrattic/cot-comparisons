They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person hired a cleaner through an app that requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours. They lied about the number to get a 4-hour service because they only wanted the downstairs cleaned. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but there were more rooms than listed. The cleaner got angry, even though the person explained that the focus was on the downstairs and the upstairs was optional. \n\nFirst, the app's system is based on the information given by the user. If the app calculates hours based on the number of rooms, then providing false information might be a problem. But the user's intention was to only pay for the downstairs cleaning. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed number of rooms, which were fewer, but ended up with more when going upstairs. However, the user clearly communicated the priority to the cleaner upon arrival. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling misled, but the user did clarify the main task. \n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, if the app's terms state that the hours are based on the accuracy of the room count, the user might be in the wrong for providing incorrect info. However, if the app's terms don't specify that the user must list all rooms, and the cleaner's job was just for the hours paid, then the user isn't at fault. The user also mentioned that the cleaner had the option to do the upstairs if time allowed, which they did. The cleaner's main grievance is about the discrepancy in the listed rooms vs. the actual ones, but the user's initial intent was to only pay for the downstairs. \n\nSo, considering the user's clear communication and the fact that the cleaner had the choice to work on the upstairs, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. The app's system might be at fault for not allowing a manual hour selection. The user's actions were to save money on a service they didn't need for the entire house. The cleaner's anger seems misplaced if the user followed through with the agreed-upon hours and communicated the priorities.\n"
