They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where they input details like number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get an estimated cleaning time. The user didn't list all the rooms they actually have because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry when there were more rooms than listed. The user explained that the cleaner wasn't obligated to finish everything, just to use the time they paid for. But the cleaner was upset.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user was wrong in not listing all the rooms. The app's system is based on the input the user gives. If the user provided incomplete info to get a cheaper or shorter service, but then ended up with extra time, that's a problem. The cleaner might have expected that the listed rooms would be the only ones cleaned, and the user's misrepresentation caused confusion. But the user also clarified upon arrival that the priority was downstairs and the cleaner could use remaining time for upstairs. However, the cleaner still got angry.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the app calculates hours based on the listed rooms, not including all rooms was a deliberate deception. The user might have known that providing fewer rooms would result in fewer hours, but then the cleaner had extra time and used it on other areas. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed areas, and if they went beyond, maybe they were overreaching. But the user's initial misrepresentation is the key here. Even if the user explained their intent, the cleaner might feel misled because the terms of the service were based on false premises. So, the user is in the wrong for providing false information, leading to a misunderstanding. Therefore, answer A.\n"
