They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hired a cleaner through an app, but lied about the number of rooms to get a specific number of hours. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then was upset when there were more rooms upstairs than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author didn't list the actual number of bedrooms and bathrooms because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The app's system uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. By manipulating the input, the author got a 4-hour job. The cleaner did the downstairs in 90 minutes, then went upstairs and got angry about the discrepancy.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author intentionally provided false information to the app to get a lower cost (or maybe lower hours). The cleaner was informed upon arrival about the focus on the downstairs, but after finishing quickly, he was upset about the additional rooms. The author argued that the cleaner only needed to work the time paid for, not finish all the rooms.\n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, if the app's terms specify that the number of rooms determines the service scope, then the author might be in the wrong by providing incorrect data. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed number of rooms, and the author's manipulation led to an incomplete service. However, the author did inform the cleaner on arrival that only the downstairs was important and that he could do as much upstairs as possible. The cleaner's anger could be due to not being informed beforehand or expecting the listed rooms to be the actual workload.\n\nAnother angle is the cleaner's responsibility. If the job was supposed to cover the listed rooms, and the author didn't list them all, then the cleaner might feel cheated. However, the author's intention was to only have the downstairs cleaned, so the cleaner might have overstepped by working on the upstairs when instructed otherwise. The cleaner's reaction seems to be about being misled, but the author did clarify their needs upon arrival.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The app's terms would matter a lot here. If the app requires accurate information to calculate the hours, then the author violated that, which could be their fault. But the cleaner was also given a new instruction upon arrival, which he proceeded to do, then got upset when the job didn't match the initial listing. The author's problem is with the cleaner's attitude, but the cleaner's issue is with the misinformation. \n\nIn some cases, contracts or service agreements require accurate information. Misrepresenting the size of the house could lead to unfair billing or service terms. The author might be in the wrong because they intentionally gave false data to get a lower price, which the cleaner then had to deal with. On the other hand, the author did communicate the actual needs upon arrival, which might mitigate some of the blame. But the cleaner's frustration is understandable if he expected to clean the listed rooms and was misled. \n\nI think the main issue is the author's dishonesty in the app's form, which led to a situation where the service didn't match the cleaner's expectations. Even though they clarified later, the initial misrepresentation is a problem. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
