They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app by providing some details about their house, like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The app then calculated the hours. But the user actually has more rooms than they listed because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished that quickly and then went upstairs, got upset when there were more rooms than listed, and the user is now wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When using an app like that, there are usually terms and conditions or a service agreement. If the app requires you to list the number of rooms to determine the hours, then the user might have misrepresented the house's size, which could be a violation. However, the user's intention was to only have the cleaner work on the downstairs and not the upstairs, which wasn't part of the initial agreement.\n\nBut the user explained to the cleaner that upstairs wasn't necessary, only the time they were paid for. The cleaner got angry and felt misled. So the key points here are: did the user misrepresent the house size (which they did), and does that make them at fault? If the app's terms require accurate reporting, then the user is technically in the wrong. However, if the cleaner's job is to clean the listed rooms within the given time, and the user clarified the priorities, maybe the cleaner's anger is misplaced. The user might have miscalculated the house's size for the app's purposes but tried to adjust on the spot. \n\nBut from a legal standpoint, if the app's service is based on accurate information, lying about the number of rooms could be considered a breach of contract. However, the user tried to clarify the focus areas upon the cleaner's arrival. So maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. The cleaner might be overreacting because the user didn't list all the rooms, but if the app's pricing is based on that, the user might have a point. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the user intentionally provided false information to get a lower price, that's probably the main issue. However, the user's explanation might mitigate that. Hmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the user's intention was to only get the downstairs done and they communicated that to the cleaner, even though they lied to the app. But legally or ethically, maybe it's a different story. Wait, but lying to the app could be considered misleading. However, the user's main goal was to get the cleaner to do the important part quickly and efficiently, and they tried to adjust on the spot. So maybe B is correct.\n"
