They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a lower price. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got upset when there were more rooms than listed. The user says the cleaner was angry and now they're arguing.\n\nFirst, the user manipulated the app's system by underreporting the number of rooms. The app uses that info to calculate the hours, so by lying, they probably paid for fewer hours than the cleaner would have required for the actual house size. The cleaner might have been expecting a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms. When the user took him upstairs and showed more rooms, he got upset because he thought his time was being extended beyond what was paid.\n\nThe user's defense is that they told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and only do the upstairs if there was time. But the cleaner might have felt that the initial agreement was based on a specific scope of work, and the user misrepresented that. The key here is whether the cleaner's contract or the app's terms specify that the cleaner must only clean the listed rooms. If the app's system is designed to allocate hours based on room count, then the user's deception could be the issue. The user also mentioned that they didn't use the kitchen or bathroom much, so maybe they didn't need the full cleaning there, but the cleaner might still expect to clean all listed rooms as per the job description.\n\nThe user is upset about the cleaner's attitude, but the cleaner might be within his rights to be upset if the job wasn't as described. The user could be in the wrong for misleading the cleaner about the job scope. However, if the app's terms don't strictly enforce that the cleaner must only clean listed rooms, then maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. But since the cleaner was hired based on a misrepresented size, the user likely broke the trust and terms of the service, making them at fault.\n"
