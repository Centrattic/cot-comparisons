They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app. The writer lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour cleaning service, intending for the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. However, the cleaner finished quickly and then was upset when there were more rooms upstairs than listed. The writer didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs but ended up showing him the extra rooms, which led to the cleaner getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app calculates the hours based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. If the user didn't list the actual number because they didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs, that's a problem. The cleaner probably expected to clean the listed number of rooms, and the user misrepresented the house's size. Even if the user told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, the contract was based on a certain house size. The cleaner might have agreed to a specific task based on the provided info, so the user's deception could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the user might have misled the cleaner about the scope of work. The cleaner might feel they were paid for a certain job but ended up dealing with an unexpected number of rooms. Even if the user said to only do what's possible in the time, the cleaner could argue that the initial information was incorrect. The user's responsibility is to provide accurate information for the service. If the app's pricing model is based on room count, lying about that could be a breach of the service agreement. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't provide honest information, leading to a misunderstanding and potential breach of contract. The answer would be A.\n"
