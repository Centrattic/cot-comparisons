They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to keep the cost down. The app calculates the hours based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, so the user underreported to get a 4-hour window. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then was upset when there were more rooms upstairs.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the terms of the service. The app's system is designed to estimate the time based on the rooms listed. If the user provided incorrect information, that might be a problem. The user intended to use the cleaner only for downstairs, but the cleaner was under the impression that they were hired to clean all the rooms listed. \n\nThe user claims they told the cleaner that only the downstairs was important and he could do the upstairs if he had time. The cleaner was angry because the actual number of rooms was higher than listed. The user is now considering a complaint due to the cleaner's attitude.\n\nNow, considering if the user is in the wrong. The app's process requires accurate input to determine the hours. By lying about the house size, the user set up a scenario where the cleaner might not be able to complete the job as expected, even though the user's intention was to limit the work. But the cleaner's contract was based on the app's calculation, which the user manipulated. The cleaner might feel that their time was misused or that the job wasn't as described. Even if the user explained upon arrival, the initial listing was false, which could be considered deceptive. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that they clearly communicated the scope of work when the cleaner arrived. However, the app's terms of service likely expect accurate information. The user didn't provide the correct details upfront, leading to a misunderstanding. The cleaner's frustration is understandable because they might have planned their work based on the listed rooms. \n\nAlso, the fact that the user didn't have a party and the house wasn't as used as expected might have contributed, but that's not the main issue. The main issue is the false information given to the app, which could be seen as the root of the problem. The user is in the wrong for not being honest about the house size, leading to an underpayment for the cleaner's time. Even if the cleaner's attitude was unprofessional, the initial deception by the user is problematic. So the answer is A.\n"
