They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where you input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the house size to get a 4-hour service, intending to only have the cleaner do the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but there were more rooms than listed, making the cleaner angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the contract or agreement between the author and the cleaner. The app's system is based on the number of rooms, which the author manipulated by not listing all the rooms. By doing so, the author paid for a service that was based on a smaller house. The cleaner probably expected to clean all the rooms listed, so when the actual number was higher, he felt underpaid. The author, on the other hand, thought the cleaner only needed to work for the time paid, regardless of the actual rooms. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author misrepresent the house size to get a cheaper rate? Yes. Did the cleaner expect to clean all the rooms listed? It's possible because the app's structure is based on that. By not listing all the rooms, the author essentially misrepresented the job's scope, leading to a situation where the cleaner had to do more work than he was paid for. The author then expects the cleaner to work the full time but not finish all the extra rooms, which might not be fair to the cleaner.\n\nHowever, the author did mention when the cleaner arrived that the focus should be on the downstairs and the upstairs was optional. But the cleaner might have expected that the time provided was sufficient for the listed rooms. If the author had listed all the rooms, the app would have assigned more hours, leading to a higher cost. The author's intention was to save money by hiding the house size, which the cleaner discovered later, leading to his anger.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author might be in the wrong because they misled the service provider. The cleaner was hired based on inaccurate information, which affected the terms of the job. Even if the author thought they could manage the extra time for the upstairs, the cleaner's contract (through the app) was based on the rooms listed. The anger from the cleaner is understandable because he was essentially working for less than the job required. Therefore, the author's actions could be considered deceptive, making them at fault."
