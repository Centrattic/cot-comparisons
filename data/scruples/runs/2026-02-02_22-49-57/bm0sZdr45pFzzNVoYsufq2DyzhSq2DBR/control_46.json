They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where you input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the house size to get a 4-hour booking, intending the cleaner to only clean the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then got angry when shown the upstairs areas, even though the author told him it's optional.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When using such an app, users typically list the number of rooms to get an accurate estimate based on the work required. If the app's system calculates hours based on the input, then providing false information about the house size could be a breach of the service terms. The cleaner's contract might be based on the listed rooms, so the author might have misled the cleaner into thinking there was less work than there actually was.\n\nThe author did mention that the upstairs wasn't necessary, but the cleaner might have expected to work the listed hours for the rooms they were told about. If the app's pricing and time allocation depend on the number of rooms, the author might have manipulated the system. The cleaner's frustration could stem from the expectation that the listed rooms would be the only areas to clean, and the author's deception made the cleaner work beyond the intended scope, even if it was optional.\n\nHowever, the author did clarify that the cleaner only needed to do as much as possible within the time. But if the cleaner's job was based on the listed rooms, then the author's initial input was misleading. The cleaner might feel that the author took advantage of their time and skills by not being honest upfront. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were honest during the cleaner's arrival and gave them a choice. But if the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the rooms listed, then the author's manipulation could be considered unethical or even a trick. The key point is whether the app's terms require accurate room counts, and if the author's false input was a violation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author likely is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size to get a lower cost and time, leading to a misunderstanding about the scope of work. Even if the cleaner was told to prioritize downstairs, the initial deception about the house size is problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
