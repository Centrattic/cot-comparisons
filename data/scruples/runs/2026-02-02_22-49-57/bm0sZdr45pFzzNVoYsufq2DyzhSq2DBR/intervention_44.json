They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours, but they didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got upset because there were more rooms than listed. The author says they told the cleaner upfront that the downstairs was most important and that he could do the upstairs if he had time. The cleaner was angry and felt it was wrong, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the contract between the two parties. When using the app, the system determines the hours based on the number of rooms. If the user provided inaccurate information, that's a problem. The app's algorithm is expecting a certain number of rooms to allocate the hours, so by not listing all rooms, the author might have misled the app and the cleaner. But wait, the app uses the input to decide how many hours to assign. If the author didn't list the full size, but the cleaner was told to focus on the downstairs and only do what he could upstairs, maybe the problem is about expectations set through the app versus the direct communication.\n\nThe cleaner was probably expecting to clean the listed rooms within the booked hours. If the app allocated 4 hours based on a certain number of rooms, and the actual house has more rooms, the cleaner might feel that the author is taking advantage of the system. The author could argue that they communicated clearly in person, but the app's system relies on accurate information. The cleaner might feel that the initial listing was misleading, even if there was verbal clarification.\n\nAlso, the app's terms of service might require accurate information when listing the house size. If the user intentionally provided false information, that could invalidate the booking. The author's intention to save money by not listing all rooms might be considered unethical, even if they tried to adjust the hours manually. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed rooms within the given time, and if the actual house has more, the cleaner might feel that the user is being dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did clarify in person that the downstairs was the priority and that the cleaner could do the upstairs if time allowed. The cleaner's anger might be more about the system being manipulated rather than the verbal agreement. But the app's system requires accurate input, so the user's manipulation of the system could be seen as the root of the problem. The cleaner might have a valid point if the app's pricing and time allocation depend on the listed rooms. The cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms, and the user's underreporting led to the cleaner having to choose between under-cleaning the listed rooms or overworking by cleaning unlisted ones.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's initial input was false, which affected the app's pricing and the cleaner's expectations. While they did clarify in person, the core issue is the discrepancy between the information given to the app and the actual house size. The cleaner's anger stems from being misled, even if the user tried to clarify later. So, the author might be in the wrong for not providing accurate information initially, which is a key part of the service agreement.\n"
