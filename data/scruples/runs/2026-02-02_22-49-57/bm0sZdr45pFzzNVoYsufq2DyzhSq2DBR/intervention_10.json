They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaning time instead of longer. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then was upset about the upstairs, which wasn't listed correctly.\n\nFirst, the key points: The app requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the rooms to get a shorter time. The cleaner was told to focus on the downstairs, and the author made it clear that the upstairs wasn't necessary unless time allowed. But the cleaner got angry because the actual house was larger than listed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author intentionally misrepresented the size of the house to get a lower cost (since hours depend on the app's calculation). But when the cleaner arrived, the author clarified that the focus was on the downstairs and that the upstairs was optional. The cleaner was still upset, perhaps because they expected to clean all the listed rooms and were surprised when there were more.\n\nFrom the app's perspective, the service is based on the information provided. If the user lies about the number of rooms, that could be a problem because the app's system is designed to allocate time based on the input. The cleaner might have been expecting a certain workload based on the listed rooms, and when they found more, they felt it was a breach of contract or expectation. \n\nHowever, the author did inform the cleaner upon arrival about the priority areas and that the upstairs wasn't required unless time allowed. The author might argue that they were honest during the cleaning and that the cleaner wasn't forced to do the upstairs. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the misrepresentation during booking is acceptable. Even if the author clarified later, the initial lie about the house size could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner might have priced their time based on the listed rooms, and the author underpaid by not listing the full size. If the app uses that info to calculate the hours and payment, the author might be responsible for the discrepancy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to deceive the cleaner, just the app's system. The cleaner's reaction seems more about the unlisted rooms rather than the initial lie. But the author could have listed the full house and then negotiated the focus areas, but chose not to, possibly to save money. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the app's terms might state that the user must accurately represent the space. If that's the case, the author is in the wrong for misleading the app, and consequently the cleaner. The cleaner might have been under the impression that they were being paid for a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms, but the actual work was more. However, since the author clarified during the cleaning, the cleaner had the choice to refuse or ask for more payment, but they completed the downstairs and then got upset about the upstairs. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area, but the initial misrepresentation to the app could be considered wrong because it affects the service agreement. The author didn't tell the cleaner about the extra rooms upfront when booking, which led to the cleaner's confusion and anger later. The author's solution was to lie to the app but then be honest with the cleaner, but the problem originated from the misrepresentation during the booking process. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accurately representing the house size on the app, leading to an unfair situation for the cleaner.\n"
