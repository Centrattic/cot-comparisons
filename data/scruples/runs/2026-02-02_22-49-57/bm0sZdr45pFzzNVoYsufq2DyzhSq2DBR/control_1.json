They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a lower price. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and was upset when there were more rooms upstairs than listed.\n\nFirst, the user's main issue is that they didn't list the actual number of bedrooms and bathrooms. They intentionally input fewer to get a shorter cleaning time. The app calculates hours based on room numbers, so by underreporting, they got a 4-hour job. The cleaner worked fast and had extra time to go upstairs, but when shown the extra rooms, he got angry.\n\nThe user argues that they only needed the downstairs cleaned and told the cleaner he could do as much as time allows. But the cleaner felt misled because the listing didn't match reality. The key points here are honesty in service contracts and expectations. When you use a service like this, you're supposed to provide accurate information to get the right pricing and time allocation. By lying, the user might have broken the contract terms, leading to the cleaner's frustration. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed rooms and not have extra time, but since he finished early, the user wanted him to use the remaining time for other areas. However, the discrepancy in the listing caused the conflict.\n\nThe user's defense is that they could have canceled the service if needed, but they didn't. However, the main issue is the false information on the app. The user's actions could be seen as deceptive, leading to the cleaner's dissatisfaction. Even if the user explained the situation upon arrival, the initial misrepresentation is problematic. The cleaner might feel entitled to adjust his service based on the actual conditions, but the user tried to limit his work. \n\nSo, considering these points, the user's intentional misrepresentation of the house size is likely the wrong. The cleaner's anger stems from feeling misled, which is valid if the service terms require accurate information. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
