They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and during the sign-up process, they had to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The user intentionally didn't list all the rooms they had because they wanted the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs, which they considered more important. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when he saw more rooms than listed, he got angry and upset. The user now wants to know if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, the app's system is designed so that the number of rooms determines the hours. By not providing accurate info, the user might have misled the app's algorithm, which set the cleaner's expected workload. The cleaner probably expected to work the full 4 hours based on the listed rooms. When he found out there were more rooms, it's understandable he felt misled because that could mean more work than he anticipated for the same pay.\n\nThe user tried to clarify the priority to the cleaner upon arrival, but the cleaner's contract was based on the initial listing. The user's siblings and they might have benefited from the cleaner working extra hours on the upstairs, but the cleaner might feel he wasn't compensated for that additional work. Ethically, the user should have listed the actual number of rooms to match the app's terms. Even if they explained the priority, the initial misinformation is problematic. The cleaner's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a valid response to being misled about the scope of work. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not being transparent with the app's process.\n"
