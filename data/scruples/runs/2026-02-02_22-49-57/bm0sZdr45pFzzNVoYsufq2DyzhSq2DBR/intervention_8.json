They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour service. The cleaner got angry because there were more rooms than listed, even though the user told him to focus on the downstairs and do as much upstairs as time allows.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the terms of the agreement. The app works by inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours. The user underreported to get a shorter, cheaper service. They didn't actually need the cleaner for the full time, but the cleaner finished quickly and then had extra time. The user didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs, but the cleaner was upset because the house was larger than listed.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the app's system is based on the information provided. If the user intentionally gave incorrect info to get a lower price, that's a problem. The cleaner's job time was based on that info. If the cleaner's contract includes cleaning all areas regardless of the listed rooms, then the user might be wrong. But if the app's terms allow flexibility where the cleaner only has to do the listed rooms unless told otherwise, then the user isn't wrong. Also, the user did communicate the priority areas. The cleaner might be overstepping by being angry when the user made it clear that upstairs wasn't a priority. However, the user manipulated the app's system to get a shorter time, which might be unethical. But maybe it's not illegal. The user is a minor (17-22), so their intentions are to save money, which is common. The cleaner might have a right to expect accurate information. But the user did adjust the hours based on their needs. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the user isn't in the wrong because they communicated their needs, and the cleaner's reaction is unprofessional. The issue is the app's system, not the user's communication. So answer B.\n"
