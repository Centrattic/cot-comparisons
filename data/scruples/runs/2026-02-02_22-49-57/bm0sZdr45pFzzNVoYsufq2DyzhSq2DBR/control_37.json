They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour cleaning job when the actual house is bigger. The cleaner got upset because there were more rooms than listed, even though the user told him to focus on the downstairs and only do what he can upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The user used an app where you input the number of rooms to get a set number of hours. They underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a shorter booking time. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the extra rooms, he got angry because the house is bigger than listed. The user says they emphasized that downstairs was the priority and the cleaner could do as much upstairs as he had time for. The cleaner was still upset and the user is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Let's break it down. When using the app, the user was supposed to input accurate details to determine the cleaning time. By lying about the number of rooms, they essentially misled the app into sending a cleaner for 4 hours instead of the time that would have been allocated if all rooms were listed. The cleaner's job was based on the estimated time derived from the input. If the cleaner finishes the main areas quickly, but the house is actually larger, is the user responsible for the discrepancy?\n\nThe user's defense is that they told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and do what he can upstairs. However, the cleaner might have expected to clean the entire space they listed, and when the actual size is bigger, they might feel the user was deceptive. The user didn't inform the cleaner about the extra rooms until after he had already started working. But the user also mentioned that the upstairs wasn't as important and to do what he could in the remaining time.\n\nLegally, if the contract was based on the app's calculation, which the user manipulated by providing false info, then the user might be in breach of the terms. The cleaner might have expected to clean the rooms listed. However, the user tried to limit the scope by explaining during the job. The cleaner's anger could be due to feeling that the user manipulated the system, leading to an unfair situation where he's expected to work more than the agreed time without extra pay.\n\nAlternatively, the user could argue that the cleaner's job was to work within the 4 hours, and since he finished downstairs quickly, using the remaining time for what he could upstairs wasn't a problem. But the cleaner might have had a different expectation based on the listed rooms. The app's terms might require accurate room counts, so the user's deception could be the root issue.\n\nIn summary, the user's main issue was providing incorrect information to get a lower cleaning time. This could be seen as unethical or in bad faith. Even if the cleaner wasn't explicitly told about all the rooms, the app's system relies on accurate inputs. The user's manipulation led to the cleaner possibly working more than intended. The cleaner's frustration is understandable because the user misrepresented the job size. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
