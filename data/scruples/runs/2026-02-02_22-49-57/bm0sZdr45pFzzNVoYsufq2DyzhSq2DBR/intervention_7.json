They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves hiring a cleaner through an app. The user lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour cleaning service, intending to only have the cleaner clean the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry when he realized there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The user mentioned that the app uses the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. By underreporting, the user manipulated the system to get a cheaper rate, but the cleaner ended up with extra time. The user instructed the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, but when time allowed, they showed him the upstairs areas. The cleaner became upset because the actual house size was different from what was listed.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they might have thought that the cleaner would only clean the listed areas, and if there was extra time, they could do more. However, the cleaner's frustration stems from feeling that the user was deceptive, leading to an unexpected workload. The user didn't explicitly promise the cleaner that they wouldn't have to clean the upstairs, but they did mention that upstairs wasn't as important. The user is now wondering if they were wrong to not list the full size.\n\nLegally, if the service agreement states that the cleaner will clean all rooms listed, then the user might be in the wrong for not providing accurate information. However, if the agreement is based on the time provided, then the user isn't obligated to use all the time. The cleaner's issue might be more about the deception rather than the actual time used. The user's intention was to save money by not listing all rooms, but that led to a misunderstanding. The key point is whether the user's actions violated any terms of service or if the cleaner was misled. Since the user explicitly told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and only do upstairs if time allowed, it's possible the user isn't at fault. However, the initial deception about the house size could be seen as misleading the service provider. The answer might hinge on the platform's terms and whether underreporting is considered a breach. Since the user didn't explicitly promise the cleaner the upstairs wouldn't be part of the job, but the cleaner felt wronged, it's a gray area. The user might not be in the wrong if the terms allow flexibility, but the deception could still be a point of contention.\n"
