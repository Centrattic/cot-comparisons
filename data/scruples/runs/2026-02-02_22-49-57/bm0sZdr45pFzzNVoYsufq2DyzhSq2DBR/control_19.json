They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires listing the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The user didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown more rooms, he got angry because the actual size didn't match what was listed.\n\nFirst, the app's system probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the time needed. If the user deliberately underreported the rooms to get a lower price (4 hours instead of more), that might be a problem. The app's terms might state that the cleaning includes all listed rooms, so by not listing all, the user could have misled the cleaner about the scope of work. However, the user did explain upon arrival that only the downstairs was important and the upstairs was optional. The cleaner still got upset, thinking he was supposed to clean all listed rooms.\n\nBut if the user didn't list all the rooms initially, the app's algorithm would have miscalculated the hours. The user might have broken the app's rules by lying about the house's size. Even though they told the cleaner in person, the initial listing was false. The cleaner might have expected to clean only the listed rooms and was upset that there were more than expected. The user didn't inform the cleaner beforehand that there were additional rooms beyond what was listed. So, the cleaner's anger is justified because the contract (based on the app's terms) was based on a different scope. The user misrepresented the house's size, leading to an unfair situation where the cleaner was underpaid for the actual work done.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they provided false information to the app, which affected the service agreement. Even if the cleaner was told upon arrival, the initial listing was misleading. The user should have either listed the correct number of rooms or negotiated the hours accordingly. The anger from the cleaner is a result of the initial deception.\n"
