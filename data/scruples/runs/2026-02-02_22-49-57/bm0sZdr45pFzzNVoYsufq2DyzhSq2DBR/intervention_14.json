They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about hiring a cleaner through an app where they input the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the rooms they actually have because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got angry when they found out there were more rooms upstairs, even though the author had explained upfront that the priority was downstairs and the upstairs was optional if there was time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When using an app like that, usually, the service provider expects the listing to be accurate. The app's algorithm determines the hours based on the input, so if the user gives incorrect information, the service provider might feel misled. The cleaner's reaction is probably because they were under the impression they were being paid for a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms. The author didn't inform the cleaner about the discrepancy until after the service started, which could be seen as deceptive.\n\nHowever, the author did mention the priority areas when the cleaner arrived and made it clear that the upstairs wasn't necessary unless time allowed. The cleaner might have expected the time quoted by the app to cover the listed rooms, so finishing that quickly and then facing additional work might have been unexpected. The issue here is whether the initial misrepresentation of the house size was unethical or if the app's system allows for such flexibility.\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't provide accurate information, which led to a service that didn't match the app's terms. On the other hand, the author's intention was to allocate the cleaner's time efficiently. The cleaner's anger might be due to feeling overworked or underpaid, but the app's pricing model is based on the user's input. If the user inputs incorrect data, they might be responsible for the discrepancy. The cleaner could argue that the service wasn't as agreed, which might mean the author is at fault for not listing accurately. Alternatively, the author could argue they were within their rights to adjust the input to fit their needs, especially since they clarified the priority areas upon arrival. \n\nBut the key point is the app's terms. If the app requires accurate information to determine the service scope, then the author's misrepresentation could be a breach. However, if the app allows for flexibility in how the cleaner uses the time, the author might not be at fault. Since the app's instructions are based on the user's input, the author's manipulation to get a lower hour rate could be considered dishonest. The cleaner might feel entitled to expect that the hours corresponded to the actual work based on the listed rooms, leading to the cleaner feeling exploited after the fact. \n\nSo, considering that the author misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper rate and the cleaner ended up with more work than anticipated, the author might be in the wrong. But if the app's system is just an estimate and the final agreement was verbal at the start, the author's explanation could mitigate the issue. The cleaner's reaction is still unprofessional, but the initial misrepresentation might be the root cause. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being at fault for not providing accurate information, which led to the misunderstanding.\n"
