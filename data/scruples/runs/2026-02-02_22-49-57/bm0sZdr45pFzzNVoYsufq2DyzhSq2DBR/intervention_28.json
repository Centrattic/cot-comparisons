They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author hired a cleaner through an app, but lied about the size of the house to get a lower price. The app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms listed. The author didn't mention all the bedrooms and bathrooms so they could have a 4-hour cleaner instead of more. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when he found out there were more rooms, he got angry. The author told him to focus on the downstairs first and do as much of the upstairs as possible if time allows. But the cleaner was upset and argued that it wasn't what was listed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty in the service agreement. When you use an app like that, usually the terms are based on the information you provide. If the app asks for the number of rooms and calculates the hours accordingly, then lying about that could be a breach of the terms. The cleaner probably expected to clean the rooms listed, and the author didn't disclose the full scope. The cleaner might have been under the impression that they were only responsible for the listed rooms, but when they found out there were more, they felt misled. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning was to save money by not listing all rooms, but the cleaner's job might be to clean all the rooms that were listed. If the author didn't list all the rooms, but the cleaner is supposed to clean what's listed, then the author didn't actually hire the cleaner for the full house. The cleaner might have been working beyond their agreed hours if the app's calculation was based on the incomplete info. \n\nBut then, the author did communicate during the job that the priority was downstairs and that the cleaner could do the upstairs if there was time. However, the cleaner might have felt that since they were hired for a certain number of hours based on the listed rooms, they were supposed to clean all those rooms in the time given. If the author didn't list all rooms, the cleaner might not have been aware that they were being paid for a smaller job than the actual house size. \n\nThe author's intention was to only have a professional clean the downstairs, but by not being honest about the total rooms, they might have misled the cleaner. Even if the author explained during the job, the initial contract (based on the app's calculation) was based on false premises. The cleaner could argue that the terms of the service were based on incorrect information, which the author provided. \n\nOn the other hand, the app's system might not allow for partial cleaning based on the user's preferences. The user might have been supposed to list all rooms, and the app's calculation is a strict requirement. So by not listing the full size, the author didn't follow the app's guidelines, leading to a situation where the cleaner's expectations were different. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did provide incorrect information to the app, which influenced the service terms. The cleaner's anger is probably about being misled about the scope of the job. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't accurately represent the house's size, which affected the service agreement. Even if the author tried to clarify during the job, the initial setup was dishonest.\n"
