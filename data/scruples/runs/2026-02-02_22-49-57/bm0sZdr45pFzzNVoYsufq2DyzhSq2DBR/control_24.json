They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they wanted only the downstairs cleaned. The app's system calculates the hours based on the number of rooms you list. To get a 4-hour window, they underreported the number of rooms, lying about the house size to avoid higher costs.\n\nWhen the cleaner arrived, he finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs. The user showed him the rest of the house, but the cleaner got angry because the actual number of rooms was more than listed. The user had already explained that the upstairs was optional if time allowed. The cleaner was upset about the discrepancy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The key points here are the terms of the service. If the app requires listing the accurate number of rooms to determine the cleaning time, then underreporting rooms is a violation. The user manipulated the system to get a lower cost, which could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner might have agreed to the job based on the listed rooms, expecting that the time was appropriate for that scope. By not listing all the rooms, the user might have misled the cleaner about the actual work required, even if they tried to adjust expectations upon arrival.\n\nHowever, the user did clarify when the cleaner arrived that the upstairs was optional. But if the initial agreement was based on a certain number of rooms, the cleaner might feel that the user is now trying to get more work for the same price. The cleaner's reaction could be justified if the app's terms require accurate room listing. The user's actions could be seen as unethical or dishonest, leading to the cleaner's frustration. So, the user might be in the wrong for not providing accurate information upfront, which affects the service agreement.\n"
