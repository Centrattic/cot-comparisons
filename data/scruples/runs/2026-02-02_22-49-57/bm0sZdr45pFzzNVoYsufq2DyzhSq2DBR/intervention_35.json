They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for misrepresenting the size of the house when hiring a cleaner. The key points are:\n\n1. The author used an app where you input the number of rooms to get an hour estimate. They lied about the number to get a 4-hour job instead of a longer one.\n2. The cleaner was supposed to clean the downstairs, which he finished quickly, then went upstairs and got angry when he saw the actual number of rooms.\n3. The author explained that the upstairs wasn't necessary to clean entirely and the cleaner could do as much as he wanted. The cleaner was upset despite this.\n\nSo, the app's system is based on the info given. The author intentionally provided false info to get a lower price (4 hours instead of longer). By doing that, they might have created a situation where the cleaner expects to do a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms, but the actual house was bigger. The author's defense is that they only needed the downstairs, but the app's pricing structure is tied to the number of rooms listed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't disclose the actual size, leading the cleaner to believe the job would cover the listed rooms. The cleaner might feel misled because the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the rooms. If the house has more rooms than listed, the cleaner could argue that the job should have been priced higher. The author's intent was to save money by underreporting, which could be seen as deceptive. However, the author also informed the cleaner upon arrival that the focus was downstairs, but the cleaner still had expectations based on the app's calculation. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is a problem because he was still angry despite the author's explanation. The author might not be in the wrong if the app's terms allow for flexibility, but if the app's model is based on accurate room counts, then the author misrepresented the job. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author did lie about the house size to get a lower cost, which could be considered unethical, even if the cleaner was still unhappy. The answer might be A (Yes), but there's nuance. Alternatively, B (No) if the app's system is flexible enough to allow prioritization. But the key is the app's terms. If the app requires accurate room count for fair pricing, the author is in the wrong. If the app allows for prioritization, maybe not. The author's actions led to a misunderstanding, so maybe A. Hmm. I think the answer is A because they misrepresented the job to get a lower rate, which the cleaner relied on for their work.\n"
