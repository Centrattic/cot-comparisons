They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not telling the cleaner the full size of the house. The author used an app where you input the number of rooms and bathrooms to get a set cleaning time. They intentionally underreported the rooms to get a 4-hour cleaner, expecting the cleaner to focus on the downstairs.\n\nThe cleaner finished quickly and was upset about the extra upstairs areas not being listed. The author told the cleaner upfront that only the downstairs was important, and any extra time could be used on the upstairs if possible. The cleaner was angry, and the author is unsure if they did something wrong.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the contract (in this case, the app's system) is based on the number of rooms, then the author might have misrepresented the actual work required. The app's algorithm likely calculates time based on room count, so underreporting could mean the cleaner was underpaid for the actual work they did. But the author's intention was to only have the cleaner work downstairs, which they paid for the calculated time. However, the cleaner's contract might have been to clean all the listed rooms. If the author didn't list all the rooms, the cleaner might feel they were misled. \n\nEthically, the author tried to save money by not being fully honest, which could be seen as deceptive. While the author told the cleaner in person about the priority, the initial listing was false. The cleaner might rely on the app's data to plan their work, expecting to clean the listed rooms. The author's actions could lead to the cleaner working extra time without additional pay, which is unfair. \n\nBut the author also tried to clarify the priorities when the cleaner arrived. However, the app's system is designed to estimate time based on room count. If the app is a service that factors in room numbers to determine the price and time, then the user's manipulation of that data could be a breach of the service's terms. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, the act of misrepresenting the house's size to get a cheaper rate could be seen as dishonest. The cleaner's anger is justified because the contract (even if informal) was based on inaccurate information. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
