They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour cleaning job. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got angry when they showed him the upstairs rooms, which weren't listed because the author didn't want the cleaner to do them. The author explained that they only needed the downstairs, and the cleaner could do as much of the upstairs as time allowed. But the cleaner was upset and said it wasn't what was listed.\n\nHmm, the key points here are whether the app's terms require cleaning the listed rooms and if the author misrepresented the house size. The author intentionally didn't list all the rooms to get a cheaper price, which the app uses to calculate the hours. If the app's terms state that the cleaner is supposed to clean all listed rooms, then not listing them might be a problem. But if the app's terms are just an estimate based on the user's input, and the author used that to their advantage, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Also, the author communicated their needs when the cleaner arrived, so maybe the cleaner's job is to follow the customer's instructions, not the app's algorithm. The cleaner's anger might be more about the app's structure than the actual work. The author paid for the time, and the cleaner finished the main part quickly. The author might not be in the wrong because they clearly communicated their needs, even if they manipulated the app's system. But maybe the app's terms of service require accurate information, so the author could be at fault for providing incorrect data. However, if the app's pricing is based on the estimate, and the user can adjust the scope upon arrival, the author might be in the right. It's a bit tricky. I think the main issue is whether the cleaner was supposed to follow the app's listing strictly or the customer's instructions. Since the author clarified the needs upon arrival, the cleaner should have followed those, not the app's calculation. So the author isn't wrong.\n"
