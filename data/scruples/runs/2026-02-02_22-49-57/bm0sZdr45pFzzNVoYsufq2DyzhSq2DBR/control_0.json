They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms listed. The author intentionally didn't list all the bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaning session, planning to only have the cleaner work on the downstairs. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown more rooms, he got angry because the house was bigger than listed. The author argues that the cleaner only needed to work the hours they were paid for, not finishing all the rooms, especially since they were told to focus on the downstairs first.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess if the author's actions were deceptive. By not listing the actual number of rooms, they manipulated the system to get a lower rate. The app's algorithm is designed to calculate hours based on the house's size, so providing incorrect information would lead to an inaccurate service agreement. The cleaner might have expected to clean a certain size based on the listed rooms, and the author didn't disclose that the house was larger. The cleaner's job might be to clean the entire area they were quoted for, but since the author provided false info, the cleaner's expectations were set based on incorrect data.\n\nThe author did explain the focus on the downstairs when the cleaner arrived, but the cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms were the total. If the contract (even implicit) is based on the listed rooms, then the author's deception could be problematic. The cleaner's anger might stem from being misled about the scope of work. The author might argue that the cleaner was only paid for 4 hours and should have done as much as possible in that time, but if the cleaner's quote was based on the smaller house, then the author underpaid for the actual service rendered.\n\nHowever, the app's terms might specify that the listed rooms determine the service scope. If the app's terms state that the cleaner is only responsible for the listed rooms, then the author might not be in the wrong for following those terms. But if the app's pricing is based on the total rooms, then not listing all rooms could be considered a misrepresentation.\n\nAnother angle: the cleaner's job is to clean the house as per the listed details. If the author provided false details, the cleaner's time and effort were based on incorrect information. The author might be responsible for the discrepancy. The cleaner could argue that they were promised a certain house size and were then asked to clean more without additional pay. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did inform the cleaner upon arrival about focusing on the downstairs and that they don't need to finish everything. The cleaner might have had the choice to take their time or ask for more hours. But since the cleaner was already hired for the 4 hours, maybe the author's initial deception is the main issue here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author did misrepresent the house size, leading to a mismatch in expectations. The cleaner's anger is justified because they were misled about the scope, even if the author tried to adjust expectations later. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
