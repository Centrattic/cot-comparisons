They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size of their house when hiring a cleaner through an app. The cleaner got angry because the actual number of bedrooms and bathrooms was higher than what was listed, which led to the cleaner having to work longer than expected but only being paid for the original hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author used an app where instead of choosing hours, you input the number of rooms. They underreported the bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour booking instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the additional rooms, he got upset because he felt misled. The author explained that they only needed the downstairs cleaned and the cleaner could do what he could with the remaining time, but the cleaner was still angry.\n\nThe key points here are the terms of the service agreement. The app's system is based on the number of rooms, which presumably equates to the time required. If the user underreported the rooms, they might be violating the app's terms. However, the app's algorithm determines the hours based on the rooms listed. The user might have intended to save money by listing fewer rooms, but the cleaner was expecting to clean based on the listed rooms and the time provided. The cleaner's contract might be based on the time allocated, which the user paid for, so if the cleaner finishes the listed rooms early, they might have the right to leave or not do extra work unless paid for it. However, the user's app might not allow for partial services based on time, but rather based on room count.\n\nThe user's main argument is that they only needed the downstairs cleaned and told the cleaner upfront. But the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on rooms, so misrepresenting the room count could be seen as deceptive. Even if the user told the cleaner in person, the app's terms might require accurate information. The cleaner might have a right to be upset if he based his work on the listed rooms and was given a time that was insufficient for the actual rooms, but the user underreported to get a shorter booking. However, if the user paid for the time and the cleaner had the choice to do more work within that time, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But ethically, misrepresenting the house size to get a cheaper rate could be seen as a problem.\n\nAlso, the cleaner's attitude is mentioned, but the user might not be at fault for that. The main question is whether the user misrepresented the house, which could affect the service agreement. If the app requires accurate room counts to determine the correct hours, then the user is in the wrong for manipulating the system. However, if the app's system is just a guideline and the user can adjust on the fly, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area, but the user did lie about the size of the house to get a lower cost, which isn't honest. So, the answer might be A, but the user's intent was to only clean part of the house, so maybe B. Hmm.\n"
