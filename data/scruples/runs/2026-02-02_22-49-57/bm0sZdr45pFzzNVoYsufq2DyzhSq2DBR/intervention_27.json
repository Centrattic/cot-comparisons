They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not listing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner. The app they used calculates the cleaning time based on the number of rooms listed. The author intentionally underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaner instead of a longer time, which would have cost more. \n\nThe cleaner arrived, finished the downstairs quickly, went upstairs, and got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author had told the cleaner beforehand that the downstairs was the priority and he could do the upstairs if he had time. But the cleaner was upset, thinking he was only supposed to clean the listed rooms.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, when you use an app that asks for specific details to determine the service, providing false information could be problematic. The app's terms might require accurate input to ensure the cleaner is scheduled for the correct duration. The author manipulated the information to save money, which could be seen as deceptive. However, the author did communicate the priority areas to the cleaner upon arrival, so maybe they didn't expect the cleaner to stick strictly to the listed rooms. \n\nBut the cleaner's job is to clean the house as per the agreed terms. If the app's system is designed to allocate time based on the input, then the author's false input led to an understaffed time for the actual size of the house. The cleaner might feel he was misled because the app's calculation is based on the user's input, which is supposed to be accurate. The author might not have intended to deceive the cleaner directly, but by lying to the app, they misled the service provider. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did specify the priority areas when the cleaner arrived, so maybe they thought the cleaner had the discretion to focus there. But if the app's terms are strict about the listed rooms, the author could be in the wrong for not providing accurate information, leading to a mismatch in the service rendered. The cleaner's anger might stem from the fact that he expected to clean only the listed rooms, but there were more, which wasn't covered in the agreement. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Did the app require accurate input? 2) Was the author's manipulation of the input deceitful? 3) Did the author communicate the actual priorities to the cleaner? \n\nIf the app's system relies on accurate data to determine service time, the author's action was deceitful. Even though they told the cleaner the priority areas, the initial misrepresentation might still be unethical. The cleaner might feel he was wronged because the app's system was designed to ensure proper time allocation based on the user's input. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). However, if the app doesn't enforce strict adherence to listed rooms and the cleaner's job is to use discretion, then maybe not. But given the information, the author's manipulation of the input to get a cheaper service is problematic. So, the answer is A.\n"
