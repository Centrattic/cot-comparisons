They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size of their house when hiring a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours, but the author lied about the number to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one.\n\nSo, the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but there were more rooms than listed. The cleaner got angry because he expected the listed number. The author had told him to focus on downstairs and do upstairs only if time permits.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the terms of the service agreement. If the app's terms state that the hours are based on the listed rooms and that the cleaner is supposed to clean all the listed rooms, then the author might be in the wrong because they provided false information. But if the service is based on the time hired, and the cleaner is supposed to use that time as the customer directs, then maybe the author isn't at fault.\n\nThe app's terms probably specify that the hours are calculated based on the number of rooms listed. By lying, the author might have breached that agreement. Also, the cleaner could have expected to clean the rooms they were listed, so completing them quickly and moving on might be part of the deal. The author's instruction to do upstairs only if there's time could be seen as an additional request, but the cleaner might have expected to work according to the listed rooms.\n\nAnother angle: if the author didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs, they should have listed fewer rooms. The app's system is designed to estimate time based on the size, so underreporting could be considered misleading. The cleaner's anger might be because he was under the impression he was being paid to clean all listed rooms, which were fewer than actually present. So the author misrepresented the job, leading to the cleaner's expectation being violated.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they provided inaccurate information to get a lower cost, leading to a discrepancy in the service agreement.\n"
