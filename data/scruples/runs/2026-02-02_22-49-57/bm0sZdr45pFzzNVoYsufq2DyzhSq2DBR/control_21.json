They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the size of their house when hiring a cleaner. So, the author used an app that requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. They underreported to get a 4-hour cleaner, but the actual house has more rooms upstairs. The cleaner got angry because there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app uses the number of rooms to calculate the required hours, then the author is essentially misleading the system. The app might be designed to estimate the time needed based on the input. By providing false info, the author might have created a situation where the cleaner isn't paid for the extra time they might have spent on the extra rooms. However, the author did mention that the cleaner should only do what they can in the time given, which was 4 hours. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and had time left to do the upstairs, but there were more rooms than listed. The cleaner was upset because the actual work exceeded the estimated based on the provided info.\n\nFrom a contractual perspective, if the service agreement states that the cleaner is responsible for all listed rooms within the time frame, then the author's underreporting could be a problem. However, if the agreement is that the cleaner is hired for a specific time and can choose what to do within that time, then the author might not be in the wrong. The author tried to explain that the cleaner wasn't obligated to finish all the rooms, just to work for the time paid. But the cleaner felt misled because the actual house was bigger than listed, leading to potential underpayment for their work.\n\nAnother angle is the app's terms of service. If the app uses the room count to determine the time, the author's manipulation could be violating those terms. The cleaner might have been hired under the assumption that the rooms listed were all that needed cleaning. The author's dishonesty about the room count could be the root of the issue here. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling they were given a task that required more time than the payment covered, even if the author intended to let them leave once the time was up.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to save money by not cleaning the upstairs areas, which they could handle themselves. The cleaner might have expected to clean all listed areas within the time, and the surprise of more areas not being listed could have caused the conflict. The key here is whether the app's system is designed to account for any discrepancies. If the app's algorithm is meant to predict time based on room count, the author's manipulation undermines that system, leading to potential unfair treatment of the cleaner.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did make it clear that the cleaner wasn't required to finish all the upstairs areas. The cleaner's job was to work for the time paid, and the author isn't forcing them to stay longer. The cleaner's anger might be more about the perceived deception rather than the actual terms of the job. If the cleaner's contract with the app is based on the time provided, then the author isn't in the wrong for not making the cleaner stay beyond that time. The problem arises from the initial misrepresentation of the house's size, which could be considered unethical or deceptive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's main issue is providing false information to get a cheaper rate, which led to a situation where the cleaner felt overworked. Whether that's ethically wrong depends on whether the app's system relies on accurate inputs. If the system is designed to calculate time based on the accurate number of rooms, then the author is at fault for manipulating the system. The cleaner's anger is justified if the job required more work than the paid time allowed due to the author's underreporting. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they misrepresented the house size, leading to potential unfair expectations and workload for the cleaner.\n"
