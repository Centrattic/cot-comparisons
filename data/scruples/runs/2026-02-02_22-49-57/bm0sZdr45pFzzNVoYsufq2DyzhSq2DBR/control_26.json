They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario did something wrong. They hired a cleaner through an app, but lied about the house size to get a specific number of hours. The cleaner ended up finishing downstairs quickly and was upset about the upstairs not being listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When using an app to hire a cleaner, typically the user is expected to accurately list the details like number of rooms and bathrooms. The app probably uses that info to calculate the required hours. If the user input false information, the app might be charging based on incorrect data, leading to a cleaner being assigned for a time that's too short for the actual work needed. \n\nThe cleaner might have expected to work the entire duration based on the house size provided. By understating the number of rooms, the user could be underpaying for the service in terms of the cleaner's time. The app's system likely accounts for standard cleaning times per room, so if the user didn't list all rooms, the cleaner might feel shortchanged. Even if the user explained the focus areas beforehand, the contract was based on false premises. \n\nAlso, the cleaner's reaction is a point to consider. If the app's terms state that the cleaner is supposed to clean the listed areas, and the user didn't list all the rooms, the user might be at fault. The cleaner could argue that the user misrepresented the job scope, leading to an incomplete job despite the cleaner's efforts. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention was to prioritize certain areas and was clear about that upon arrival. However, the initial misrepresentation might still be a breach of the service agreement. Even if the cleaner has leftover time, the user might have committed to a contract based on incorrect information. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the user might be in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size, leading to a cleaner being sent for a job that's actually bigger than what was listed. The cleaner's time is being underutilized according to the app's calculation, which could be unfair to the cleaner. The user's justification that they can prioritize certain areas doesn't negate the initial misrepresentation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user probably is in the wrong because they provided false information to get the desired hours, which could lead to an unfair situation for the cleaner. The app's system is designed to estimate time based on house size, so altering that data is deceptive. Even if the user's intention was to focus on certain areas, the contract was based on incorrect premises, which the cleaner was not aware of. Therefore, the answer would be A (the user is in the wrong).\n"
