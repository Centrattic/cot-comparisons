They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size of their house when hiring a cleaner. The situation is that the author used an app where you input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get an estimated time for the cleaner. The author underreported the number to get a cheaper rate, but the cleaner ended up with extra time after finishing the downstairs quickly and got angry when shown the upstairs rooms. The author tried to explain that the upstairs wasn't necessary but the cleaner was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author intentionally listed fewer rooms to get a 4-hour job, but the house actually has more rooms. The cleaner finished downstairs in 90 minutes and then went upstairs, expecting to be paid for the full time. The cleaner was angry because the actual house size was larger than listed.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't require the cleaner to finish all the upstairs areas, just to do as much as possible in the remaining time. But the cleaner was upset about the discrepancy in the listing. The question is whether the author misrepresented the job's scope, leading to the cleaner's dissatisfaction.\n\nLegally, if the app's terms require accurate room counts to determine the service time, then the author may have violated that. But since it's a platform-based service, the terms of service might not be clear. Ethically, the author might have misled the cleaner by providing false information, which the cleaner relied on for their service. The cleaner expected to clean a certain number of rooms within the quoted time, but the house was larger, which could be a breach of the service agreement.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they made it clear during the appointment that the priority was the downstairs and the cleaner could choose to work on the upstairs if time allowed. But the cleaner was still upset, possibly because they felt the initial listing was deceptive. \n\nFrom the cleaner's perspective, they might have priced their time based on the listed rooms, and the actual work required more time. Even if the author didn't make them finish the upstairs, the initial misrepresentation could be seen as dishonest. \n\nBut if the author was transparent during the session, maybe the cleaner's reaction was overblown. However, the key issue is whether the author misrepresented the job's scope. In most service agreements, accurate information is crucial. If the app uses the room count to calculate the service time, then providing false info could be considered misleading. Even if the cleaner was told during the session, the initial listing was incorrect, which could be the root of the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for providing incorrect information when booking, which led to an unexpected situation. Even if the author clarified later, the initial misrepresentation could be the basis for the cleaner's anger. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
