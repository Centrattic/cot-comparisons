They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they misrepresented the size of the house to get a lower price. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when he saw there were more rooms than listed, he got angry. The user claims they only needed the downstairs cleaned and told the cleaner he could do the upstairs if he had time.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user intentionally lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour cleaning service instead of a longer one. The cleaner, based on the listed rooms, probably expected a certain amount of work for those hours. When he saw there were more rooms, he felt wronged. \n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, when you use a service like this, you're usually agreeing to the terms set by the app. By not listing the actual number of rooms, the user might have violated the service's terms. The cleaner's job might be based on the listed rooms, so if there are more, he might feel he's entitled to more time or payment. \n\nHowever, the user did communicate that the priority was the downstairs and that the cleaner could work on the upstairs if time allowed. The cleaner might have assumed that all listed rooms were to be covered in the agreed time, but the user didn't list them, so the contract might not cover those rooms. \n\nThe cleaner's anger might stem from the surprise of having to clean more than expected, but if the user didn't list those rooms, it's not the cleaner's fault. Still, the user intentionally misrepresented the information, which is a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong if the app's terms allow for flexibility, but they could be at fault for not being transparent. Alternatively, the cleaner is within his rights to be upset if he believes the user tricked him into undercharging. \n\nIn the end, the user didn't force the cleaner to do more than the agreed time. They offered to let him do extra if he had time. The cleaner's attitude is unprofessional, but the user's initial misrepresentation might have set up a misunderstanding. \n\nSo, while the user's actions were questionable, the cleaner's reaction is also unhelpful. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong since they communicated the priorities and the cleaner could have asked for clarification. But the fact that they lied about the house size does play a role. However, since they only wanted the downstairs and communicated that, maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the user didn't force the cleaner to do extra beyond the paid hours and communicated their needs. The cleaner's anger is misplaced given the user's instructions.\n"
