They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the number of rooms to get a specific hour rate. The cleaner worked quickly, finished the downstairs in 90 minutes, and then was supposed to do the upstairs. However, when the user showed him the additional rooms, the cleaner got angry because the actual number of rooms was higher than listed. The user claims they only wanted the downstairs and that the cleaner was supposed to do as much as possible in the time, but the cleaner felt misled.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user intentionally provided false information about the house size to secure a lower rate. The app's pricing model is based on the number of rooms, so by underreporting, the user essentially manipulated the system. The cleaner, following the agreed-upon hours, finished the main areas quickly but then faced extra work not accounted for in the original agreement. The cleaner's anger stems from feeling that the user tricked them into working more without additional pay, even though the user's intention was to avoid paying for the full time. \n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, when you sign up for a service that uses a specific pricing model (like per room), providing false information to get a lower rate could be considered fraudulent. The cleaner's agreement was based on the premise that the house had a certain number of rooms. If the actual house is larger, the user is getting a service for less than what it should cost. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms, and by adding more rooms, the user is expecting the cleaner to work beyond the agreed scope. The cleaner has the right to be upset because the user misrepresented the facts, leading to a situation where the cleaner might have to work longer without compensation or the user is getting an unfair deal. \n\nThe user's defense is that they only wanted the downstairs and the cleaner could decide how to spend the remaining time. However, the cleaner's contract was based on the initial room count. The user's deception in listing the house size is the root of the problem. Even if the user's intention was to save money, the cleaner's labor for the additional rooms wasn't accounted for in the original agreement. Therefore, the user is at fault for providing misleading information and expecting the cleaner to handle more work without adjusting the terms. The cleaner's anger is justified because they were given incorrect premises for their work hours and payment.\n"
