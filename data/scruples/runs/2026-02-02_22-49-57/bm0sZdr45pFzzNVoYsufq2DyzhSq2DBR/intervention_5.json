They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to determine the hours. They lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour service instead of the app's calculated longer time. The cleaner finished downstairs quickly and then got upset when shown the upstairs, which wasn't listed.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to only have the cleaner focus on the downstairs areas, which they considered more important. They communicated this upon arrival, emphasizing that upstairs was optional. However, the cleaner was upset because the actual number of rooms exceeded what was listed. \n\nThe key points here are the terms of the service agreement. If the app requires listing all rooms for accurate hour calculation, then the user didn't follow the process correctly. By underreporting the rooms, they might have misled the app's algorithm, which in turn affected the cleaner's expectations. The cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms were all that needed cleaning based on the initial input. \n\nThe user did communicate their priorities to the cleaner, but the initial misrepresentation could be the root of the cleaner's frustration. Even if the user explained the focus areas upon arrival, the discrepancy in the listing might have set the cleaner up with a different expectation. The cleaner might feel they were paid for a certain scope of work, which wasn't fully met if they didn't know about the extra rooms upfront. \n\nHowever, the user also clarified during the service that the cleaner wasn't obligated to do all the upstairs areas. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling misled, but the user's explanation about only needing the downstairs clean could mitigate that. \n\nLegally and ethically, if the terms of the app require accurate room counts, the user violated that by providing false information. But if the cleaner's contract is based on the time rather than the number of rooms, then the user isn't in the wrong for not completing all listed tasks. \n\nThe user's main issue was the app's structure, which ties hours to room count. By manipulating the input, they tried to get a cheaper service but ended up causing a conflict. The cleaner's reaction is a consequence of the initial misrepresentation. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions led to a misunderstanding. While they communicated their needs, the initial false listing is the main issue. The answer hinges on whether the app's terms require accurate information. Since the user didn't follow the app's process, they might be in the wrong. But if the app's algorithm is just a suggestion and the user could adjust the hours manually, then it's less clear. Given the app's structure here, the answer is probably A, but it's a bit nuanced.\n"
