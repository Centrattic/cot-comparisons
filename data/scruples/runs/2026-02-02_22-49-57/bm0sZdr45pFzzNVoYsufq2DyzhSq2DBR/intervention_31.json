They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and the app's system determines the hours based on the number of rooms listed. The user didn't list all the bedrooms and bathrooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset when they showed him the upstairs areas, thinking there were more rooms than listed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user misrepresented the house size to get a specific number of hours. The cleaner followed the instructions given upon arrival but was upset about the discrepancy. The user's main goal was to clean the downstairs thoroughly, and the cleaner was told to do as much as possible of the upstairs if time allowed.\n\nNow, considering the app's process, it's designed to calculate hours based on the input of rooms. By not listing all rooms, the user essentially manipulated the system to get a shorter job, which might be against the app's terms. However, the user's intention was to prioritize certain areas and the cleaner was instructed not to feel pressured to clean the upstairs fully. \n\nThe cleaner's anger might stem from feeling misled about the job's scope. Even if the user provided clear instructions on the day, the initial listing was inaccurate. But if the app's terms don't strictly enforce that the cleaner must clean all listed rooms, then the user's approach might be acceptable. However, if the app's process is designed such that the cleaner expects to clean all listed rooms within the given time, then the user could be at fault for not being honest upfront.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user might not be in the wrong if the app's system isn't clear about requiring full disclosure. But if the app's instructions imply that the cleaner will cover all listed rooms, then the user did mislead the cleaner. The main issue is about the expectation set by the app's system versus the user's actual needs. The user didn't lie to the cleaner directly but manipulated the system to get a different outcome. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is about the discrepancy between the listed and actual rooms. If the app's process is strict about the listed rooms, the user is in the wrong. But if the app's process is flexible and allows for priority areas, the user isn't. Since the user explained the priority to the cleaner on arrival, maybe the main issue is the app's system not being clear enough. However, the user's manipulation of the app's system to get a shorter cleaning time could still be considered misleading, even if the cleaner wasn't explicitly told about all rooms.\n\nSo, depending on the app's terms and how the system works, the answer could be either way. But in the absence of strict rules from the app, the user's actions might not be entirely wrong. However, since the user intentionally listed fewer rooms to get a shorter time, which might not align with the app's intended use, there's a case to say the user is in the wrong. But the user's intention was to use the time effectively, not to deceive the cleaner. The cleaner's attitude is also a factor here; even if the user is right, the cleaner's poor demeanor is problematic. So, the user might not be in the wrong, but the situation is a bit nuanced.\n"
