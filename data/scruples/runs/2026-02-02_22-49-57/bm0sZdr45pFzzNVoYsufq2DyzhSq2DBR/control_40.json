They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and when signing up, they had to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author intentionally listed fewer rooms than actually existed, so the app gave them a 4-hour cleaning time. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author told him not to worry about the upstairs, but the cleaner was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's system is based on the number of rooms to calculate hours, then lying about the number of rooms might have affected the pricing or the expected work. The cleaner probably expected to clean the number of rooms listed, so when there were more, maybe he felt overworked or underpaid. The author might be at fault for providing false information, leading the cleaner to expect a certain workload that wasn't actually there. \n\nOn the other hand, the author clearly communicated that the priority was the downstairs and that the cleaner didn't need to finish everything. The cleaner might have been unhappy because he thought he was being asked to work more than agreed, even if he had the time. But if the app's terms are clear that the number of rooms affects the time, then the author's deception could be the issue. \n\nThe author didn't mention if there were any specific terms about not including other rooms. If the app's terms state that the listed rooms are the ones to be cleaned, then the author's omission could be a problem. However, if the app's system just estimates time based on rooms, but doesn't enforce a strict limit, then maybe the cleaner was overstepping. But the author's main mistake was providing incorrect data, which might have led to a misunderstanding. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is a bit strong, but his job might depend on the app's system, so he could feel that the author misled him. The author should have been honest about the house's size to set accurate expectations. Even if they only wanted the downstairs cleaned, listing the actual number of rooms would have been the correct approach. So, the author is probably in the wrong for lying about the house size, leading to a situation where the cleaner felt wronged. \n\nAdditionally, the author is considering complaining about the cleaner's attitude, but maybe the cleaner was justified in feeling that the job was misrepresented. The key issue is the dishonesty in listing the house's size, which could affect the service's pricing and the cleaner's understanding of the job scope. Therefore, the author is at fault here.\n"
