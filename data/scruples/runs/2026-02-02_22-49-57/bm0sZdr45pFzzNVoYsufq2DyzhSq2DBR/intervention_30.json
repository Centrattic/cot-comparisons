They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the house size to get a lower price. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then expected to do the upstairs, but the author didn't want them to. The cleaner got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author used an app where you input the number of rooms to determine the hours. They intentionally underreported the rooms so the app would give fewer hours. They told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and only do what's possible. But the cleaner was upset because the actual house size was bigger than listed.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that they only wanted the cleaner for a certain time and didn't want to pay for more hours. The cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms. But did the author mislead the cleaner? They didn't list the full size, which could be seen as deceptive. However, the app's model is based on the user's input, so if the user provides false info, the app's calculation is invalid. The cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms were accurate, leading to an agreement based on that. The author tried to clarify the priorities, but the cleaner was upset about the discrepancy.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author didn't intend to pay for the entire house, so they manipulated the app to get the right hours. The cleaner, on the other hand, might have thought the job scope was set by the listed rooms, hence the frustration when the actual house was bigger. The author's actions led to a situation where the cleaner did more than necessary but then was upset when not paid for the extra time. However, the author was within their rights to hire for a specific duration and set priorities. The app's model might not account for such scenarios, so the problem is between the app's design and the user's input. The author might not be in the wrong because they clearly communicated the priorities to the cleaner, even if the initial listing was inaccurate. The cleaner's anger could stem from unmet expectations based on the app's process, not the author's direct actions. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
