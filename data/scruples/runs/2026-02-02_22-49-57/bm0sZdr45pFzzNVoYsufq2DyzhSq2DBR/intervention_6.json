They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the house size when hiring a cleaner. The situation is that the author used an app where you select the number of rooms to get an hour estimate. They underreported the rooms to get a 4-hour service, but the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when shown the upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a specific need to clean the downstairs thoroughly for their parents' strict cleaning standards. They didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs but needed more time for that. However, the app's system is based on the number of rooms, which the author manipulated to get a shorter service time. \n\nThe cleaner completed the downstairs in 90 minutes and was left with 2.5 hours. The author then took him upstairs, but he was upset about the discrepancy. The author's defense is that they only needed him for 4 hours and that the upstairs cleaning wasn't required. \n\nNow, considering the app's terms. If the app's service is based on the number of rooms listed, then the author's misrepresentation could be a problem. The cleaner might have expected the listed rooms to be the total workload, and the author getting more hours than justified by the initial listing could be seen as a breach of the service agreement. However, the author also explicitly told the cleaner upon arrival that the focus was downstairs and that the upstairs was optional if time allowed. \n\nBut here's the catch: the app's pricing model is tied to the room count. By underreporting, the author might have paid less than the actual cost, which could be considered unethical. The cleaner's job might be based on the assumption that the listed rooms are the total to clean within the allocated time. If the app calculates the time based on rooms, the author's deception could lead to the cleaner being underpaid for the actual work required. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to clarify the priority areas upfront, and the cleaner was informed that upstairs cleaning was optional. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling misled about the total workload he was contracted for. The author might not have intended to hide the upstairs areas but wanted to manage the cleaner's time. However, the app's system is designed to estimate time based on room count, so the author's manipulation could invalidate the contract terms.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's action could be seen as dishonest because they provided false information to get a lower price. The cleaner's reaction is about the expectation set by the app's system. Even if the author clarified priorities, the initial misrepresentation might be the root of the problem. The author could be in the wrong for not listing the full size, as the service's cost and time are determined by that information. The cleaner's job might have been based on the assumption that the listed rooms are all that need cleaning, so getting an extra 2.5 hours to do more work wasn't part of the agreed terms.\n\nSo, considering the app's structure and the potential for the author to have manipulated the system for a lower cost, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But if the app's terms don't strictly enforce that the listed rooms must be the only ones cleaned, and the author explicitly communicated the priorities, maybe B is the case. However, the app's system relies on accurate info to calculate the hours, so the author's deception is the issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
