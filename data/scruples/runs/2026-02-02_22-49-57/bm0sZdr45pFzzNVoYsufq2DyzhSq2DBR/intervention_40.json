They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a lower cost. The cleaner ended up having extra time and was upset when they discovered the actual number of rooms, even though the user told them to focus on downstairs first and only do the upstairs if there was time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app probably uses the number of rooms and bathrooms to estimate the time required. By misrepresenting that info, the user might have violated the app's terms. But the user's main goal was to have the cleaner focus on the downstairs. They didn't want to pay for more time than necessary. The cleaner, however, felt misled because the actual house size was larger than listed, leading to a conflict when the cleaner discovered the discrepancy.\n\nThe user argues that they only needed the cleaner to work for the time booked, and the cleaner was free to leave once that time was up. But the cleaner felt wronged because the user provided incorrect information. Legally, if the contract (even an implicit one) requires the cleaner to clean all listed rooms, then the user might be in the wrong by not listing everything. However, the user made it clear during the cleaning that the focus should be on the downstairs. The cleaner might have had an expectation based on the listing that the house was smaller, but the user adjusted the scope on the spot.\n\nAnother angle: the user's intention was to save money by not listing all rooms, which the cleaner found out. The cleaner's job is to clean as per the agreement. If the user misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper rate, that's deceptive. However, the user did communicate the actual priority during the service. The cleaner might not have realized the house was bigger until after starting, leading to the conflict. \n\nI think the key points are deception about the house size to get a lower price versus the actual communication during the service. The user might have been in the wrong for the initial misrepresentation, but the cleaner might have overreacted once the user clarified the priorities. However, the user's actions did lead to a misunderstanding and possible breach of the service agreement. So, maybe the user is partially in the wrong, but the cleaner's reaction was also unprofessional. The answer could lean towards the user not being entirely in the wrong, but there is some fault on both sides. But according to the user's question, they want a yes or no. Since the user provided false info to the app, that's a problem. However, in practice, many services might not check the accuracy, but the user's actions might be considered misleading. But the cleaner's reaction was also harsh. Hmm. Maybe the user is in the wrong for the initial misrepresentation, but the cleaner's behavior was also inappropriate. The question is if the user is in the wrong. The answer is B (No) if the user can argue that the priority was communicated and the cleaner was only paid for that time, so the misrepresentation was to get the lower rate but the actual work was adjusted. However, the act of falsifying data to get a lower rate is ethically questionable. So the user is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size, leading to the cleaner's confusion and potential underpayment. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
