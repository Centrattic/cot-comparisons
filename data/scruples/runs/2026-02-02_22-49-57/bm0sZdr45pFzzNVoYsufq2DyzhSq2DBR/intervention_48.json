They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner. So the situation is, they used an app where you input the number of rooms to get an estimated cleaning time, but they underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a cheaper rate. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author told the cleaner that the downstairs was the priority and he could do whatever he had time for upstairs, but the cleaner was still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's system works by calculating the time based on the number of rooms, then providing incorrect info would be misleading. The cleaner might have expected that the time quoted was sufficient for the listed rooms. If the actual house is bigger, the cleaner might feel that they were promised a certain number of hours for a certain number of rooms, but now they have to do more work without extra time. But wait, the author didn't list the actual number of rooms, so the cleaner was given a time estimate based on the smaller number. If the cleaner worked the full 4 hours and only did the downstairs, that's fine. But since he finished early and went upstairs, maybe he felt entitled to more time for the additional rooms.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the parents are strict about cleanliness, so maybe the cleaner expected that the entire house would be cleaned within the given time, especially since the author didn't explicitly state that only the downstairs was needed. The cleaner might have thought that the quoted time was for the whole house based on the listed rooms, so when there were more rooms, he felt it was unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did explain when the cleaner arrived that the downstairs was the priority and the upstairs was optional. The cleaner might have misunderstood the initial listing. However, the initial information provided (number of rooms) affects the time quote. If the app's algorithm is designed to calculate time based on rooms, then the author's manipulation of that data could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner might have based his work on the given time expecting to cover the listed rooms. If the house is bigger than listed, the cleaner might feel he's being shortchanged in time for the actual work.\n\nBut the author did clarify the priorities upon arrival. So maybe the cleaner's anger is about the initial misrepresentation rather than the instructions given when he arrived. The key point is whether the contract or service terms require accurate information about the house size. If the app's terms state that you must provide accurate details, then the author is in the wrong. If not, maybe the cleaner was just unhappy because he thought the time was insufficient for the actual house, even if the author told him otherwise.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong if they communicated their priorities clearly once the cleaner arrived, even if the initial listing was a bit off. However, if the app's system relies on accurate input for the time calculation, then the author's deception is an issue. The cleaner's reaction might stem from the discrepancy between the listed rooms and the actual house size, leading him to feel that the time wasn't enough for the actual work. The author's responsibility is to provide accurate information to get the correct time quote. By not doing so, they might have set up an unfair expectation. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they misled the system, leading to an incorrect time allocation, even if they clarified the priorities later.\n"
