They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a specific number of hours. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when they showed him the upstairs, even though they told him he didn't have to clean everything.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the terms of the service. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. If the user didn't input the actual numbers, the app would calculate based on a smaller house, giving them a 4-hour service. But the house actually has more rooms. The cleaner might have expected to clean a certain number of rooms in that time, and when he finished early, the user thought he could use the remaining time for the upstairs. However, the cleaner was upset because the house was bigger than listed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user misrepresented the house size to control the hours, the cleaner did the downstairs faster than expected, and when shown the upstairs, he got angry. The user argues that they only paid for the hours, not the specific rooms, but the cleaner felt it was a setup because the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms. \n\nI think the user made a mistake by not being honest about the house size. The app's system is designed to allocate hours based on the number of rooms, so if they lied, the cleaner might have expected a smaller workload. When the cleaner finished quickly, they assumed they were supposed to do more, but the user had already planned for that. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling misled about the scope of work. Even though the user told them to focus on downstairs, the initial misinformation about the house size might be the issue. The user is responsible for providing accurate information when using the app. So, the user is in the wrong for not being truthful, leading to a misunderstanding. The cleaner might have a right to be upset because the service agreement was based on false premises. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
