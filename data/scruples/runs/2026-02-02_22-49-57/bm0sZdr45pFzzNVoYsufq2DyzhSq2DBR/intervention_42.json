They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, but lied about the size of the house so the cleaner would only be scheduled for 4 hours instead of longer. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and was upset about having to clean the upstairs when they said he didn't have to.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author inputted fewer bedrooms and bathrooms than actual to get a 4-hour rate. The app's system is based on the number of rooms to determine hours. The cleaner was angry because the actual number of rooms was higher, even though the author told him to focus on the downstairs and do the upstairs only if time permits.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the discrepancy between what was listed on the app and the actual house size. The app's pricing or scheduling is based on room count, so the author tried to manipulate that. But then, they also communicated their intent to the cleaner in person, clarifying that the upstairs wasn't necessary to finish. The cleaner, however, felt misled and was upset.\n\nNow, the author is wondering if they were wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. Let's consider the app's terms. If the app requires accurate information to determine the service, then the author's lie might be a breach of terms. However, the app's main concern is probably the hours, not the exact room count. The author was upfront with the cleaner once he arrived, so maybe the cleaner's attitude is the problem.\n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, if the app's service agreement states that the cleaner is responsible for all rooms listed, then the author's misrepresentation could be an issue. But if the agreement is based on hours and the cleaner was informed of the actual scope after arrival, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The cleaner was paid for 4 hours and the author didn't pressure him to do more than that. The cleaner might have felt the need to do more because of the initial listing, but the author made it clear the priority was downstairs. \n\nThere's also the aspect of fairness. The cleaner might have expected to work only the listed rooms, but the author managed to get a lower rate by reducing the room count. Even if they communicated in person, the app's system was designed to calculate time based on rooms, so the author's initial input was deceptive. However, the cleaner was still able to work within the 4 hours, even finishing early. The author isn't making the cleaner stay longer, just using the remaining time to clean more if possible.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to save money by not listing all rooms, but they were honest with the cleaner once he arrived. The app might have a policy against misrepresentation, but the immediate situation involved clear communication. The cleaner's reaction could be due to the unspoken expectation that the listed rooms are the ones to be cleaned, not that the actual time is the limiting factor. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a valid point about the app's system. The answer would hinge on whether the app's terms require accurate room counts and if the author's actions violated that, but from the user's perspective, they communicated their needs properly after the fact.\n"
