They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hiring a cleaner and not listing the full size of the house. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author used an app to hire a cleaner. The app requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour booking instead of a longer one. They only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, which is more important. When the cleaner arrived, the author reiterated that the priority was the downstairs and the cleaner could do as much upstairs as time allowed. However, the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset when shown the upstairs, which had more rooms than listed. The cleaner was angry, and the author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author intentionally provided false information about the house size to control the cleaner's expected work hours. The app's system is based on the number of rooms to determine time, so the cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms. The author didn't mention the extra rooms, leading to a misunderstanding. \n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, if the app's terms specify that the cleaner must clean all listed rooms (since that's how the hours are calculated), then the author might have violated the terms by not being honest. The cleaner might have been under the impression that all rooms listed would be covered within the quoted time. The author's deception could lead to the cleaner not being paid for additional time or expecting to work longer, but since the author paid for 4 hours, the cleaner was within those hours.\n\nHowever, the author did clarify upon arrival that the priority was downstairs and the cleaner could do as much upstairs as possible. The cleaner might have thought the list was accurate, so the discrepancy between the listed rooms and actual rooms could be a point of contention. The author's lie led to an incomplete job and the cleaner's frustration. \n\nBut the author might argue that they communicated the priority and that the cleaner's anger is unwarranted. However, the initial deception in listing the house size is problematic because the app's pricing model relies on accurate information. The cleaner might not have agreed to the terms if the actual number of rooms was known. Therefore, the author is at fault for providing misleading information, leading to a mismatch in expectations. The cleaner isn't obligated to do more than what's agreed, but the app's system assumes accurate input from the user. So, the author's dishonesty here is likely the root of the problem.\n"
