They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner. The situation is that they used an app to hire the cleaner, and instead of choosing the hours, they input the number of rooms, which the app used to determine the hours. The author lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour window, intending only to have the cleaner do the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the additional rooms, he got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app's process is based on the number of rooms, which presumably correlates with the expected time. By underreporting, the author might have misled the system. But the cleaner's contract might be based on the app's calculation. So if the app allocated 4 hours based on the input, the cleaner is paid for that time. The author wanted the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs, but the cleaner finished early and had time left. The author didn't explicitly tell the cleaner not to clean upstairs, just that it's not necessary. However, the cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms within the allocated time.\n\nThe cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that the author didn't provide accurate information, leading to an underestimation of the work required. If the app's pricing is based on room count, not time, then the author's manipulation of that info could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner might have agreed to a job based on the premise of cleaning a certain number of rooms for the given time. If the actual number of rooms is higher, the cleaner might feel underpaid for the time spent on the extra rooms.\n\nBut the author did clarify upon the cleaner's arrival that the focus was on the downstairs and that upstairs cleaning wasn't required. The cleaner still had the time to work on the upstairs, but maybe expected to use all the hours. The problem arises when the cleaner finishes early and then is shown more rooms than listed. The cleaner might feel that the author's initial misrepresentation affected the job's scope.\n\nLegally, if the contract is between the user and the app, not the cleaner directly, then the cleaner's obligations are based on the app's terms. If the app's terms require cleaning the listed rooms, then the author might be in the wrong for not listing all rooms. However, if the cleaner was hired under the assumption that the listed rooms are what needed to be cleaned, then the author's underreporting could lead to a breach of the service agreement.\n\nAdditionally, the cleaner's attitude is a point of contention. The author might feel wronged by the cleaner's response, but the root cause is the initial deception. It's possible that the cleaner expects transparency in job listings to ensure they're adequately compensated for the work they do. The author's intent was to not pay for extra time, but the cleaner might expect to be paid for the time they spend on the job, regardless of the initial room count.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions\u2014misrepresenting the number of rooms to get a lower cost\u2014could be seen as deceptive, especially if the app's pricing and the cleaner's expectations are based on accurate room counts. The cleaner's reaction, while unprofessional, might be a response to being misled about the job's scope. The author's responsibility is to provide accurate information to ensure fair service and payment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being upfront about the actual size of the house.\n"
