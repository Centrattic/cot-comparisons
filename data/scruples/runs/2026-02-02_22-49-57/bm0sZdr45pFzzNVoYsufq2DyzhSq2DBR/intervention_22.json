They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of rooms listed. The author intentionally underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour service, knowing the cleaner wouldn't have time to finish the actual full house. The cleaner got angry when he realized the house was bigger than listed, even though the author told him not to worry about finishing the upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there are usually guidelines or terms of service. The app calculates hours based on the input, so if the user lied about the number of rooms, they might have violated those terms. But the author's intention was to only have the cleaner work on the downstairs. The cleaner did finish the downstairs quickly and then was shown the upstairs, leading to his anger. \n\nThe author argues that the cleaner was hired for a specific time and that he should work within that time, doing as much as possible. The cleaner, however, felt misled because the app's pricing model is based on the number of rooms, not just the time. If the app requires accurate information to determine the service duration, then the author's lie could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner's job might be to clean the listed rooms within the allocated time, and if there are more rooms than listed, the cleaner might feel they were shortchanged in time. \n\nBut the author also said from the start that the cleaner doesn't need to finish everything upstairs. However, the cleaner's reaction suggests that the problem was the discrepancy between the listed rooms and the actual ones. The app's system probably expects the user to list all rooms to be cleaned, so providing false info might mean the user agreed to pay for a certain scope of work. The cleaner's time is accounted for based on the number of rooms, so finishing downstairs quickly and then being presented with extra rooms could be an issue of not enough time for the actual workload. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have thought they were saving money by not listing all rooms. But the cleaner's rate is based on the app's calculation. If the app's algorithm assumes that the listed rooms are the only ones to be cleaned, then the author didn't inform the cleaner properly. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed rooms and that's all. However, the author did mention the cleaner doesn't have to finish everything upstairs. \n\nIs the author wrong for lying about the house size? If the app requires accurate information to provide the service, then the author is responsible for that. The cleaner's job is to clean what's listed, and the author might have misled the cleaner by not providing the correct number. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that the user manipulated the system, leading to an unfair situation where he's expected to work more for the same pay. \n\nBut maybe the app's terms are more about the house size for scheduling and pricing, not a strict requirement to clean all listed rooms. The author could be within their rights to direct the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs. However, the initial lie about the number of rooms might be the problem because it affects the app's ability to accurately allocate time and resources. If the cleaner's time was calculated based on the number of rooms, and there are more rooms than accounted for, that's a breach of the service agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the user explicitly told the cleaner not to pressure himself to finish the upstairs. The cleaner's job is to work for the agreed time, not to finish all rooms. But the app's system might be designed so users list the rooms they want cleaned, and the cleaner is paid for the time to do that. If the user lied about the number of rooms, the app might have charged accordingly for a smaller house, but the user is now asking the cleaner to do more than what was paid for. However, the user only paid for the 4-hour service, which was based on the false input. The cleaner's time is fixed, so maybe the user is not in the wrong because they didn't ask him to clean the extra rooms beyond the time. \n\nBut the cleaner's argument is that the user didn't list the correct number of rooms, which made the app's time allocation incorrect. The user might be in the wrong for providing false information to the app, leading to an underpayment for the cleaner's potential work. Even if the cleaner chose to clean the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, the user's initial lie could be the problem because the app's pricing and time were based on incomplete data. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. The key points are the app's terms and the user's intent. If the app requires accurate room counts to schedule the right amount of time, then the user is wrong for lying. But the user tried to communicate that only the downstairs was important and that the cleaner didn't need to finish the upstairs. The cleaner's anger seems to stem from the discrepancy in room numbers, not the prioritization of tasks. The user might have violated the app's terms, but the immediate interaction with the cleaner was honest. However, the initial act of lying to the app to get a lower price is ethically questionable. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for misleading the app, which affects the cleaner's compensation and the service agreement.\n"
