They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for hiring a cleaner and not telling them the full size of the house. Let me break this down.\n\nSo the situation is that the author used an app to hire a cleaner. The app requires entering the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the rooms they had because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. They ended up with a cleaner who finished quickly and then got upset when going upstairs revealed more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the agreement. The app probably uses the input to estimate the job's scope and set the hours. If the author intentionally reduced the number of rooms to get a lower hour estimate, that might be an issue. The cleaner was hired based on a specific scope, and the author changed the actual work without updating the cleaner. But wait, the author did explain at the start that the priority was downstairs and the cleaner could do upstairs if time permits. So the cleaner knew the focus was on the lower floor but still got upset when seeing more rooms than listed.\n\nIs the app's system strict about the listed rooms? If the app's terms say that the cleaner is responsible for all listed rooms, then the author's omission might be a problem. But if the app's model is just to estimate time based on input, and the client can adjust tasks on the spot, maybe it's not. However, the cleaner might have been paid based on the estimated hours for a smaller space, and the author is essentially getting more work done for less. That could be seen as unfair.\n\nBut the author did communicate before the job started that the priority was the downstairs. The cleaner might have expected to clean only the listed rooms. The author's intention was to minimize the cleaner's work, not to deceive about the actual house size. However, if the app's system relies on accurate input for fair payment, then the author's manipulation of the app to get a lower hour count might be the issue. The cleaner was underpaid for the actual work done, or the author is getting more value than paid for. That could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't inform the cleaner about the upstairs until after the downstairs was done quickly. Maybe the cleaner expected to work the full 4 hours, but since the task was finished early, they were upset that there wasn't enough work as listed. The author's plan was to have the cleaner work on the upstairs if time allowed, but the cleaner might have thought they were being overcharged or underutilized.\n\nAnother angle: the app's terms might require the client to list accurate information. If the author lied about the number of rooms, that's a breach of terms, making the author at fault. However, the author's intention was to use the cleaner for a specific part of the house, not the entire space. The app might not allow for such customization, leading the author to work around the system.\n\nAlso, the cleaner's reaction of being angry and saying it's not what was listed suggests that the app's system is strict. If the cleaner was hired based on the listed rooms, the author's omission of the actual number could be the problem. The author might have misled the cleaner about the job's scope, even if they tried to clarify on-site.\n\nBut the author didn't lie initially; they just didn't list all rooms. Maybe the app's system is designed to require accurate information so the cleaner can prepare. If the cleaner expected to clean a certain number of rooms and found more, they might feel the job was misrepresented. The author's manipulation of the app to get a lower estimate might be the root issue here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of not listing all rooms to get a lower hour estimate could be considered misleading, even if they tried to adjust the scope on-site. The cleaner was hired based on a specific job description that didn't match the reality, leading to the conflict. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
