They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour booking. The cleaner was supposed to focus on the downstairs, which he finished quickly, then went upstairs and found more rooms than listed. The cleaner got angry and felt it was a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. The user intentionally provided incorrect info to get a shorter booking time. The cleaner worked the 4 hours but didn't finish all the listed rooms, but then the user didn't want him to clean the unlisted upstairs areas. The cleaner was upset because there were more rooms upstairs than listed, even though the user said he could do as much as he wanted with the remaining time.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size. The user's reasoning is that they only needed the cleaner for the downstairs and wanted to save money. But by misrepresenting the house size, they might have led the cleaner to expect a certain amount of work. The cleaner might have planned based on the listed rooms and found that he was working on more than he was paid for. \n\nThe user also says the cleaner was angry about the unlisted rooms. The problem here is that the app's pricing model is based on the number of rooms. If the user didn't disclose all the rooms, the cleaner might have been underpaid for the actual work he did. The user might have given the cleaner a job that required more than 4 hours if he had known the full size, so the cleaner's time wasn't fully accounted for in the payment. \n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned they didn't use the upstairs as much, so maybe the cleaner could have cleaned it in the remaining time. But the issue is that the user didn't list those rooms, so the cleaner might feel entitled to more hours or payment for the extra work. The user's actions could be seen as deceptive, which might be a problem even if they were trying to save money. \n\nOn the other hand, the user did specify that the cleaner could focus on the downstairs and was okay with him not finishing the upstairs. But the cleaner's contract might have been based on the listed rooms. If the app's terms require the cleaner to do the listed rooms and the user didn't provide accurate info, that's a gray area. \n\nIn terms of ethics, being dishonest about the house size to get a lower price is questionable. Even if the user wasn't using the entire house, the cleaner's compensation is tied to the number of rooms. The user might owe the cleaner for the additional rooms he ended up cleaning, even if he had time. But the user didn't want to pay for more time because they didn't list the rooms. \n\nSo, the user is in a tough spot. They lied to get a lower cost, but the cleaner ended up doing more work than expected. The cleaner's anger is understandable because he might have been working under the assumption that the listed rooms were the only ones to be cleaned. The user's actions could be considered wrong because they misrepresented the house's size, leading to a possible underpayment for the cleaner's actual labor. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
