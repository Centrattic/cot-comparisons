They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to determine the hours. They lied about the house size to get a 4-hour service, only wanting the downstairs cleaned. The cleaner finished quickly and was told to do the upstairs if time permits, but he got angry when shown the extra rooms.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the user is in the wrong for not listing the full size. The app's system is based on the number of rooms to calculate time. If the user provided false info, the cleaner was under the impression that the house was smaller. The contract here is based on the app's algorithm, so by lying about the number of rooms, they might have created a misleading expectation. The cleaner probably expected to clean a certain number of rooms within the 4 hours, but the actual number was higher, leading to more work than anticipated. \n\nHowever, the user did clarify upon the cleaner's arrival that only the downstairs was necessary and the upstairs wasn't mandatory. But once the cleaner saw the extra rooms, he got upset. The key point is whether the initial misrepresentation affects the agreement. If the app's pricing is tied to the number of rooms, then the user didn't pay for the extra rooms. The cleaner might feel they were tricked into thinking the job was shorter, hence the remaining time was supposed to be for the additional rooms they didn't charge for. \n\nOn the other hand, the user could argue that the cleaner was aware they could leave after 4 hours, and the extra time was just for additional work. The problem arises from the cleaner's expectation based on the listed rooms. The user's responsibility was to provide accurate information to the app to determine the correct hours. By not doing so, they might be breaching the terms of the service. The cleaner isn't obligated to stay for the full time if they feel the job isn't as described. But the user also didn't explicitly state that the upstairs wasn't part of the job, just that it wasn't necessary to finish everything. \n\nIn most service agreements, if you misrepresent the scope of work, even if you don't force the worker to do all the extra, you might be liable. The cleaner could argue that the initial information was false, leading to a situation where he's working more than he anticipated. However, the user is within their rights to not pay for the extra rooms if they didn't list them. The conflict is about expectations and transparency. The user's intention was to save money by underreporting, which might be ethically questionable. Legally, maybe the cleaner isn't entitled to do the extra work, but the user's dishonesty in the initial setup is problematic. The answer likely hinges on whether the app's terms require accurate room counts, which they probably do. So the user is in the wrong for misrepresenting the house size, even if they didn't make the cleaner do all the extra work.\n"
