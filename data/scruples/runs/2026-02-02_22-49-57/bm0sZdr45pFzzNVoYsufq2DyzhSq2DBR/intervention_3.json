They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the cleaner the house was smaller than it actually was. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms, and the app calculates the hours. The author wanted to save money by not listing all the rooms, but the cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got angry when he saw the upstairs wasn't listed. The author explained they only needed the downstairs, but the cleaner was upset.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider whether the app's terms require accurate listing. If the app asks for room count to determine hours, then providing incorrect info would be against the terms. But maybe the app's terms aren't clear. The author's intention was to save money by underreporting, but the cleaner's job time was based on that info. The cleaner might expect that the time given is sufficient for the listed rooms. However, the author also told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and that the upstairs was optional if time permitted.\n\nThe cleaner's anger might stem from feeling the job description wasn't accurate, leading to underpayment for the time given. If the app charges a certain rate based on the listed rooms, the author might be underpaying the cleaner for the actual work done. But the author isn't directly paying the cleaner; they paid through the app. Wait, the app might have set a price based on the listed rooms, so the author might have paid less than the actual value. That could be an issue. However, the cleaner's contract is with the app, not the user, so maybe the user isn't in the wrong here. Alternatively, if the app's system relies on accurate room counts to allocate time and payment, the user's deception could be problematic. But the user's main obligation is to follow the app's terms, not directly to the cleaner. The cleaner's attitude might be unprofessional if he was aware he could work on the upstairs as time allowed. The author did communicate the priority, so maybe the cleaner should have adjusted his approach. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key point is whether the author violated the app's terms by providing false information. If they did, that's their fault. However, the user's intent was to save money, which might be seen as deceitful. On the other hand, the cleaner might have been overworked if he ended up cleaning more than expected. But the author did mention that the cleaner could choose to do the upstairs if time allowed, so maybe the cleaner's anger is misplaced. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they communicated their needs and the cleaner had the choice to work beyond if he wanted. The app's system might be the real issue here if it allows such discrepancies. So answer B.\n"
