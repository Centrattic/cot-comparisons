They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a lower hourly rate. The app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms listed. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when shown the upstairs, even though the user had told him upfront that he only needed to do the downstairs and use any remaining time for the upstairs if he had it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the input provided. If the user intentionally provided false information to get a cheaper rate, that might be an issue. But the user's main goal was to have the downstairs cleaned thoroughly, and they were okay with the cleaner not finishing the upstairs if time ran out. The cleaner, however, felt that because he had time left, he was obligated to clean all the rooms listed, which the user didn't do, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe user's responsibility here is to be honest when using the app. By lying about the number of rooms, they manipulated the system to get a lower price. But the key is whether the cleaner was under the impression that he would only be cleaning a certain number of rooms, and the user's deception made him work more than expected. The user did communicate their intent upon arrival, but the cleaner might have based his pricing or expectations on the initial listing. However, since the user paid for the time based on the smaller listing, and the cleaner had the option to clean more if time allowed, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong.\n\nBut then, if the app's calculation is based on the number of rooms, and the user provided false info, they might be in breach of the app's terms. However, the user's intention was to not pay for the upstairs since it wasn't used much. The cleaner's reaction is about being misled, which is valid. But the user did clarify at the start. The cleaner could have refused if he didn't want to do extra, but maybe expected to be paid for more rooms. The user might not be in the wrong because they specified the priority areas and the time was already paid for. The cleaner's anger could be about the extra work, but the user isn't obligated to pay for it beyond the time given. So the answer might be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
