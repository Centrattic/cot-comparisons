They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who hired the cleaner is in the wrong for not listing the full size of their house when booking the service.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the app calculates the hours. They lied about the number to get a 4-hour service, but the house actually has more rooms. The cleaner finished downstairs quickly and then was upset when shown the upstairs, even though the user told him he only needed to do what he could in the time.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the user misrepresent the house size to get a cheaper rate, and is it right that the cleaner is upset because the actual work done took less time than expected because of the underreported size?\n\nI think the key issue is whether the user's misrepresentation affected the terms of the service. The app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, so by lying, the user paid less. The cleaner's time was based on that calculation. If the cleaner finished the listed rooms quickly, maybe the user got a good deal, but the cleaner's time wasn't used as intended because the user had more rooms. The cleaner might feel that the user manipulated the system to get an unfair advantage, which is why he's angry.\n\nHowever, the user did clarify upon the cleaner's arrival that only the downstairs was necessary, and the cleaner chose to do more. But the cleaner's expectation was based on the initial listing. If the app's terms require accurate input, then the user was in the wrong by providing false information, leading to a misunderstanding about the scope of work.\n\nBut maybe the cleaner's contract only covers the listed rooms. If the user didn't list all the rooms, the cleaner might not be obligated to clean them, but since the user paid for 4 hours based on fewer rooms, the cleaner might have expected that time to be sufficient for those rooms. However, the user underpaid by not listing all rooms, leading to the cleaner having extra time which wasn't used as planned.\n\nIn most service agreements, accurate information is required to ensure the correct pricing. By lying, the user might have breached that agreement. The cleaner could argue that the user's misrepresentation affected the terms of the service. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they provided false information to get a lower rate, and the cleaner's time was based on that incorrect information.\n"
