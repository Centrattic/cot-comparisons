They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour booking instead of longer. The cleaner finished downstairs quickly, went upstairs, and got angry when there were more rooms than listed. The user said the cleaner didn't have to finish everything, just do as much as possible in the time.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to only have the cleaner work on the downstairs, which they prioritized. They manipulated the app's system to get a shorter booking. The cleaner ended up with extra time and went upstairs, leading to conflict when the actual number of rooms was higher than listed. The user explained that upstairs wasn't necessary, but the cleaner was upset.\n\nNow, considering the terms of service of the app. If the app requires accurate input to determine the hours, then the user violated that. However, if the app's pricing is based on room count and the user underreported to save money, that's a different angle. The user might have misled the cleaner by not providing accurate information, which could affect the service agreement.\n\nBut the cleaner was hired based on the listed details. If the cleaner expected to clean only the listed rooms and found more, it's a breach of their expectations. However, the user clarified at the start that the priority was downstairs and upstairs wasn't mandatory. The cleaner's anger might stem from not being informed properly or expecting to clean all listed rooms.\n\nThe key points are: Did the user follow the app's terms? If the app requires accurate info, then the user is in the wrong. Also, did the user clearly communicate the task? They did mention focusing on downstairs, but the initial listing was misleading. The cleaner's contract might depend on accurate listing. So, the user might be in the wrong for misrepresenting the house size, which affected the cleaner's expectations. But the cleaner's attitude is also an issue. However, the main question is about the user's wrongdoing. Since they intentionally provided false info to get a cheaper rate, that's the crux. So, answer A (Yes).\n"
