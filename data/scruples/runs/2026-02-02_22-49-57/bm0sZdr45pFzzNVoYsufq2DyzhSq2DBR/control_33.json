They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author used an app to hire a cleaner. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the number to get a 4-hour booking instead of more. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset when they showed him the upstairs, which wasn't listed. The author told the cleaner he only needed to do the downstairs and could do the upstairs if time allowed. But the cleaner was angry, saying it wasn't what was listed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author misrepresent the house size to get a cheaper rate, and now the cleaner is upset because there's more work than expected. The app's system is based on the user inputting accurate info. If the app's terms state that the cleaner must clean all listed rooms, then the author is in the wrong for providing false info. However, if the app allows flexibility when there are unlisted areas, maybe the cleaner isn't obligated to clean those.\n\nBut the author explicitly told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and do upstairs if time permits. The cleaner's contract might have been based on the listed rooms. If the cleaner was hired to clean the listed rooms and the author added more rooms without informing them, that's an issue. The cleaner might have expected to be paid for the extra work. The author didn't mention this in the listing, which could be a breach of trust or terms of service.\n\nOn the other hand, the app's pricing model might be tied to the number of rooms. By lying, the author paid less than the cleaner deserved for their time. The cleaner might have felt exploited because they had to spend extra time on unlisted areas without extra pay, even though the author mentioned they could choose. But the cleaner might have expected to be paid for the full job as per the listed rooms, and the unlisted ones were an unexpected burden.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is in accurately representing the job scope. If the app requires truthful input for the service, then the author is at fault. The cleaner has a right to be compensated for work done beyond the original scope if that's part of their contract. The author's deception in the listing could mean they are in the wrong. However, the cleaner's attitude might be unprofessional if they didn't follow the instructions given at the start. But the root issue is the initial misrepresentation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong for providing false information about the house size, leading to a misunderstanding and underpayment for the cleaner's extra work.\n"
