They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms listed. The user intentionally underreported the number to get a 4-hour service, knowing the cleaner wouldn't have enough time for the upstairs. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset when shown the additional rooms.\n\nFirst, the app's system is based on the size of the house. By lying about the number of rooms, the user effectively manipulated the system to get a lower cost (fewer hours) than warranted. The cleaner might have been hired based on the assumption that the listed size is accurate. If the app's terms state that the listed rooms determine the service scope, then the user is in the wrong for providing false information, leading to an unfair expectation of the cleaner's workload. \n\nHowever, the user did clarify upon the cleaner's arrival that only the downstairs was crucial, and the upstairs was optional. The cleaner might have expected that the listed rooms were all that needed cleaning. If the app's service agreement doesn't specify that the listed rooms are the only ones to be cleaned, the user might be in the right for directing the cleaner's time. But if the cleaner's contract or the app's policy is that the listed rooms are the agreed-upon scope, then the user's deception could be problematic.\n\nThe cleaner's reaction is understandable if they believed they were hired to clean all listed rooms, but the user misrepresented the house size. Even if the user instructed otherwise, the initial misrepresentation might be the root of the issue. So, the user is at fault for not being honest about the house's size, leading to a mismatched service agreement.\n"
