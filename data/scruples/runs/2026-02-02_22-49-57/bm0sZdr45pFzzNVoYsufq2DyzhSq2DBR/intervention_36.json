They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms listed. They intentionally underreported the actual number to get a 4-hour job instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and was upset about the upstairs not being clean enough, even though the user explained they only needed the downstairs done.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper or shorter service time. The cleaner expected to clean all the listed rooms, but the user wanted them to prioritize the downstairs. The cleaner was angry after finishing early and realizing there were more rooms than listed.\n\nLegally and ethically, when you hire someone, you should be upfront about the scope of work. By underreporting, the user may have misled the cleaner about the actual workload. The app probably bases the estimated time on the number of rooms, so if the cleaner worked less time than expected, maybe they feel they were shortchanged. However, the user did pay for the agreed-upon hours, and the cleaner had the choice to take the job knowing the listed rooms. The user also tried to clarify the priority areas. \n\nBut the cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms within the given time, and if they finished early, they might have thought they could do more. The user's main issue was not wanting the cleaner to do the upstairs, which wasn't listed. So the user might be in the wrong for not being honest about the house size, leading to misunderstandings. However, the user also followed up in person to clarify the priority. It's a bit of a gray area, but the initial misrepresentation could be seen as the user's fault.\n"
