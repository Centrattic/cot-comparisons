They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour service, intending to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the extra rooms, the cleaner got angry because the actual house is bigger than listed. The author explained that only the downstairs was important and the cleaner could do upstairs if time allowed. But the cleaner was upset and angry.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the terms of the service. When using such apps, typically the pricing and time estimates are based on the information provided. By underreporting the rooms, the author might have misled the company and the cleaner. The cleaner probably expected to clean a certain number of rooms based on the listed info. If the app's system is designed to allocate hours based on room count, then the author didn't provide accurate data, leading to a mismatch between the service expected and the actual service received by the cleaner.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were only responsible for the downstairs, but the cleaner might feel that the contract was based on a misrepresentation. Even if the author told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the cleaner might have expected to clean all the listed rooms within the given time. The fact that the cleaner finished early and then had to deal with unexpected additional work could be causing frustration. Also, the cleaner might have been paid for a certain number of hours based on the original listing, and now feels they're being asked to work more without extra pay.\n\nBut wait, the author paid for 4 hours based on the underreported rooms. The cleaner worked 4 hours, but the author is asking them to do more than what was originally agreed. However, the author allowed the cleaner to proceed to the upstairs. But the cleaner's anger might stem from feeling deceived. If the app's terms require accurate information, then the author is at fault for misleading them. The cleaner's reaction is about the discrepancy between the listed rooms and the actual ones. The author might be wrong because they misrepresented the house size, affecting the service agreement. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance here. Maybe the app's terms aren't clear, but generally, if you mislead the service provider about the scope, you're in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
