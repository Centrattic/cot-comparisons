My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about dividing a pizza between him and his wife. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks he should get 60% because he's bigger and eats more. He's planning to let her eat her fill first, which he expects will be less than half, then take the rest. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the wife gave him permission to buy the pizza with a coupon, so he's following through. He mentions that he also takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, and she gets the expensive plates while he gets cheap ones. So he's making sacrifices for her preferences. That might balance things out.\n\nThe wife wants equality in the pizza split, emphasizing \"we are supposed to be equals.\" The author argues based on their physical needs. Is equality the same as fairness here? Maybe the wife feels that 50-50 is fair, but the author thinks his larger size means he needs more. But does that logic hold? If they split food based on size, that could be a valid point, but maybe the wife feels it's about equal sharing regardless of size. \n\nHe's planning to take advantage of the situation by letting her eat her half, which he expects she won't finish, then taking the leftovers. This might be seen as him trying to get around her wishes, which could be a point against him. However, if she's okay with him eating leftovers, maybe not. But he's not asking her again and is just taking what he wants. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to let her eat her fill first and then take the rest might be manipulative. Maybe she expects a clear split, and he's trying to get more without her consent. That could be the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his preferences and trying to manage their shared resources in a way that he feels is fair. The wife's insistence on 50-50 might not consider his needs. But since they have different approaches to other meals (like sushi), maybe there's a pattern where he's already giving her more. \n\nSo, the key points: Is splitting based on size fair? Is the author respecting her agreement to split 50-50? If he agreed to her terms for permission, then going against it could be the issue. Also, his plan to take leftovers might be seen as not respecting her share. \n\nBut maybe the wife shouldn't have insisted on 50-50 if she knows he eats more. However, the author's approach to sushi shows he's willing to give her more expensive options, so he's making an effort there. The pizza situation is about his preference for quantity, not quality. \n\nI think the author is in the right because he's balancing things by considering his own needs and the prior agreement. But if he agreed to 50-50 when she gave permission, then he's breaking that agreement. However, the story says she gave permission for him to buy it, not specify the split. The split was her request, and he's not agreeing. So he's not violating any agreement. His plan is to let her eat what she wants, then take the rest. That seems reasonable because he's not forcing her to eat anything, just taking what's left. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. If the wife feels 50-50 is fair, but the husband feels his body needs more, then the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key is mutual respect and communication, but the author is trying to assert his needs. Since he's not being unreasonable (he's considering her preferences in sushi), his approach might be justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
