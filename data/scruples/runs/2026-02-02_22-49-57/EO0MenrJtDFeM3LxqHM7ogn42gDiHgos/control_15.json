My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife wants a 50-50 split. The author argues that since they're equal, but he eats more, he should get more. The wife, on the other hand, insists on equal halves. The author plans to let her eat her fill, but take the rest of her half as well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're in Japan, where pizza might be expensive. The wife is against pizza because it's unhealthy and costly. The author gets a coupon and is allowed to buy it. So the wife agreed to the purchase, maybe with the condition that they split it equally. The author ordered a large pizza not for value but because he likes eating a lot. \n\nThe key point here is the agreement. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, but she expected a 50-50 split. The author thought he should get 60% because he eats more. The wife's perspective is about equality in the relationship. She might see it as a compromise: he gets pizza, she gets sushi, so they're both getting what they like equally. But the author sees his own needs as different due to his larger size and appetite. \n\nNow, the author's plan is to let her eat her half, but then take the remaining of her portion if she's done. This could be seen as undermining the initial agreement. The wife might feel that he's not respecting her terms, even if he's doing it in a way that ends up with him getting more. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the wife agreed to allow the pizza purchase, but maybe under the condition of equal sharing. If the author didn't agree to that, then maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author could have negotiated a different split beforehand. However, he didn't, so now when she enforces her part, he's trying to circumvent it. That might be where the issue is. The author is being dishonest by letting her eat her half and then taking the rest. \n\nAlso, the author mentions taking her to sushi four times a year. She likes sushi, he doesn't. He's buying the expensive dishes for her. So maybe the pizza is part of a mutual agreement where he gets pizza, she gets sushi, and they balance it out. If the pizza is supposed to be his treat and sushi hers, then splitting it 50-50 might be her way of ensuring that he's not getting an unfair advantage. \n\nIn that case, the author's desire for 60% could be seen as not respecting the balance they've established. The wife's 50-50 might be a way to maintain equality in their exchanges, even if their preferences differ. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon terms of the pizza purchase. Even if he thinks it's fair based on his size, the wife's agreement was based on a 50-50 split. By planning to take more after she's done, he's not honoring her initial condition, which could be seen as deceitful. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
