My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple splitting a pizza. The husband wants to take 60% because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50 because they're supposed to be equal. The husband plans to let her eat her share first, then take the rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband ordered the pizza using a coupon with his wife's permission. She's against pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. He orders it as a treat from his home country. The wife's insistence on half might be about equality, but maybe she's also trying to control his diet. The husband argues based on physical needs and past compromises, like taking her to sushi. \n\nNow, the question is about fairness and respect. The husband's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done could be seen as sneaky. Even if he's bigger, forcing a split where he takes more without her consent might not be respectful. The wife might feel her wishes are being disregarded, even if he's letting her eat first. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning that he eats more might not justify taking 60% if they agreed to split it. The wife agreed to half, so maybe the husband is not respecting that agreement. The fact that he's planning to take advantage after she eats her half could be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is making a case for personal needs and past efforts. But in a relationship, compromise is key. If the wife is okay with the coupon purchase but wants equality in splitting, the husband's actions might undermine that. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her wishes and is using a loophole. But if the wife is being unreasonable, then B. But the scenario seems to show the husband is being disrespectful of her stated preference. So probably A.\n"
