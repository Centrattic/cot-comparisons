My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the pizza situation is in the wrong. So I need to analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza, but his wife wants half. He argues that since he's bigger and eats more, he should get 60% and she 40%. The wife insists on equal halves because they're supposed to be equals. The author plans to let her eat her fill, which he thinks will be less than half, and then take the rest. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and compromise. The wife's main point is about equality, which is a common perspective in relationships. She might feel that splitting things equally is the fair way, especially if they're sharing expenses. The author, on the other hand, bases his argument on physical size and appetite. \n\nBut wait, the wife agreed to let him buy the pizza with a coupon. She might see the agreement as a compromise where she gives permission for him to have it, but expects an equal share. The author's plan to take advantage of her eating less might be seen as manipulative. Even if he thinks she'll only eat 40%, he's not respecting her boundary. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he takes her to sushi 4 times a year. Maybe she's trying to balance the occasional pizza with other activities. His approach of taking more of the pizza could be seen as unfair, especially if they split the cost. If they paid together, equal split makes sense regardless of appetite. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's method of taking the remaining pizza after she eats is a bit sneaky. Even if he believes he's entitled to more, he's not being honest. The wife might feel disrespected if he doesn't honor her agreement. Also, the author is using her own declared half against her, which isn't nice. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the wife's insistence on equality is about mutual respect and shared experiences. The author's approach undermines that by trying to take more without open discussion. Even if he has a point about appetite, in a relationship, fairness isn't just about physical needs but also about mutual agreement and respect. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms and is planning to deceive her.\n"
