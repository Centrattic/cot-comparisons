My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author wants to order a pizza, and his wife doesn't like him getting it because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan. He found a coupon and she gave permission to buy it. He ordered a large pizza because he likes eating a lot, not just for value. The wife says he should split it 50-50, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's taller, bigger, and eats more. He mentions they have similar dining out habits (4 times a year each for different foods), and he's planning to let her eat her fill then take the rest. The wife ends up eating natto instead of leftovers next morning, and he's not feeling bad about it.\n\nSo the question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author got permission to buy the pizza. The wife agreed to let him get it. So he's not doing something she didn't allow. But the issue is the division. He wants 60-40, she wants 50-50. He's bigger and eats more. She says they should be equal. But he's also making a point about how he's accommodating her by taking her to a nice sushi place where he eats cheaper options, and she gets the expensive ones. \n\nIs it fair to split based on appetite? The author's reasoning is based on his physical size and consumption habits. However, the wife's argument is about equality. In many relationships, sharing equally is often seen as fair, but that's not always the case when there are differences in needs or preferences. \n\nThe wife might feel that since she agreed to the pizza, the split should be 50-50 as a shared meal. The author, on the other hand, believes his larger appetite justifies getting more. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. If the wife gave consent to buy the pizza, maybe they should have discussed the split beforehand. \n\nHe's planning to let her eat her fill first, which is a way to satisfy her share, but then take the rest. However, he's doing this knowing that she might have leftovers or not. That could be seen as manipulative. Also, the fact that he's not feeling bad about making her eat natto instead of the leftover pizza the next day might be seen as selfish. \n\nIt's possible that the author is being reasonable given his circumstances, but his approach might be seen as not respecting his wife's wishes. The wife might feel that her agreement to buy the pizza was under the condition of equal sharing, and the author is violating that. \n\nAnother angle: if he ordered the pizza as a treat for both, expecting 60-40 might not consider her feelings. The repeated insistence on 50-50 suggests she values fairness in sharing. The author's plan to let her eat until she's full but then take the rest could leave her without leftovers, which might be unfair. \n\nBut then again, if he's the one who ordered it and paid for it, he might feel entitled to more. However, since it's a shared meal, maybe equal sharing is expected. The author is trying to justify based on appetite, but the wife might see it as a matter of equality in the relationship. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area, but the author's actions, especially the plan to take the rest after she eats her fill, might be seen as not respecting her agreement. The wife's stance on equality versus the author's on physical needs. The answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some cultures, splitting food equally is a norm, while others might prioritize individual needs.\n"
