My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskReddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The husband wants to order a large pizza because he likes eating a lot, and he has a coupon. His wife agreed to let him get it but insists on splitting it 50-50. The husband argues that since he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fairer. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, where he eats cheap while she has expensive options. He plans to let her eat her half first, then take the rest if she's done, even if she ends up not eating all of her share.\n\nNow, the key points here are fairness, compromise, and mutual expectations. The wife wants equality, maybe seeing it as a shared expense or an equal partnership. The husband sees it in terms of physical needs or consumption rates. He's trying to balance his preference for pizza with her preferences in other areas (sushi). \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, splitting things equally can be about fairness in some contexts, but if the consumption differs due to size or appetite, maybe not. However, the husband's approach might come off as dismissive of her wishes. He's planning to take more than half regardless of her agreement, which could be seen as not respecting her stated preference. Even if she ends up not eating her half, the act of not honoring her agreement might be the issue. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he's ordering pizza four times a year and she's going to sushi four times a year. Maybe this is a way he's trying to balance their preferences. But if she's agreed to the pizza because it's a special treat, expecting a 50-50 split might be her condition for allowing it. The husband's plan to take more than half after she's done could be undermining that trust or agreement. \n\nSo, while the husband's reasoning is based on his needs, the act of not honoring the agreed split might be the problem. The wife might feel that he's not respecting her wishes, even if in practice she doesn't eat all her half. The husband's approach could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate, even if his intention is to get more pizza. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is planning to take more than he's allowed, which could be seen as dishonest or unfair to his wife's expectations.\n"
