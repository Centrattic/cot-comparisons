My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this scenario where they ordered a pizza and want to split it 60/40 instead of 50/50. The wife says they should be equal, but the author thinks his larger size and eating habits justify a bigger share.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author ordered pizza once a year, and the wife agreed after a coupon was found. The disagreement is about how to split it. The author mentions he eats more and is bigger, so he thinks 60/40 is fair. The wife keeps insisting on half each, citing equality. The author plans to let her eat her fill first, which he expects will be less than half, then take the rest.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness. Equality vs. equity. The wife is pushing for equal shares (equality), but the author is arguing for a share based on their different needs (equity). In a relationship, shared expenses can be a point of conflict. The pizza was ordered with mutual consent, but the division is the issue.\n\nThe author's plan to take more after she eats her half might come across as manipulative. Even if he's bigger, taking advantage of her eating habits to get more pizza could be seen as unfair. Also, the mention of her having to eat natto the next day adds a punitive element, which isn't nice.\n\nThe author also mentions that he takes her to sushi places, but he orders cheap while she gets expensive. Maybe that's a point where he's already adjusting for her preferences, so in the pizza case, not splitting equally might be inconsistent. However, the pizza is a shared expense, so splitting it equally is about equal cost-sharing, not consumption.\n\nBut the pizza was agreed to be ordered, and the wife gave permission. The author might feel entitled to the whole pizza since he paid for it, but the wife's expectation was half. The plan to take more after she eats is a bit sneaky. Even if she eats less, it's about respecting her agreement. If she agreed to the order, maybe she expects the split to be as agreed.\n\nAlso, the author's justification of body size and eating more might not be a strong enough reason to override her expectation of equality. Relationships often require compromise, and this could be a small issue where the author is not compromising. The wife's point about equality as partners might be more about fairness in the relationship rather than just physical needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the agreed-upon split and are using a manipulative plan to get more, which could hurt the wife's feelings. The answer is A.\n"
