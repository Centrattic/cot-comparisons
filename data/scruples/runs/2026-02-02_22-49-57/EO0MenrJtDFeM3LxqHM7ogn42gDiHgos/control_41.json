My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the pizza situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo the author wants to order a large pizza using a coupon. His wife doesn't like him getting pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. He ordered it anyway with her permission. Now, the wife wants half the pizza each, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, where he eats cheaper kid's plates while she gets expensive ones. He plans to take more than half after letting her eat her fill.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness in sharing. The wife wants equal halves, which is a traditional way to split things, but the husband argues for a different ratio based on their body sizes and eating habits. He also points out that in other instances, like sushi, he's giving her more expensive options, so maybe he's trying to balance things out.\n\nBut wait, the author's plan is to let her eat until she's full, which he believes will be less than half, then he'll take the rest. That might leave her with nothing left, and she has to eat natto instead. That could be seen as being unfair or taking advantage of her. Even if he's bigger, sharing equally might be more about mutual respect rather than strictly body size. Also, the wife gave permission to buy pizza, but maybe she expected a fair split. If he's taking more without her consent, even if he's planning to let her eat first, it's a bit manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to justify his actions by pointing out his own sacrifices, like the sushi thing. But maybe the issue is that both sides need to compromise. The husband's approach seems a bit underhanded. Instead of being honest about wanting a different split, he's planning to take advantage after she eats. That's not really a fair negotiation. The wife wants equality, and while the husband's needs are different, he should discuss it openly rather than using a tactic that might make her feel cheated.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because his plan is deceptive and doesn't respect his wife's agreed-upon share. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
