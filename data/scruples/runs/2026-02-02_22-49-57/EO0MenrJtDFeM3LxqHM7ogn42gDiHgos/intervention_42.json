My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about pizza sharing between the author and his wife. The author wants a 60-40 split in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her \"half,\" which he thinks she'll finish less of, and then take the rest. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife agreed to the author getting pizza with a coupon, so he's not being unreasonable there. He also takes her to sushi, which she likes, and encourages her to order more expensive items. That seems like he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences.\n\nThe main issue is the pizza split. The author argues that his larger size and appetite justify a bigger share. However, fairness in relationships isn't just about physical attributes. The wife might feel that equality in sharing is important, even if their appetites differ. The author's plan to take advantage of her eating less by taking her leftover half could be seen as manipulative or disregarding her feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his needs and has a history of compromising (like sushi). On the other hand, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness rather than the literal amount. The author's approach could come off as dismissive of her wishes, even if he's technically not taking more than she allows. The key point is whether respecting her stated preference is more important than the actual amount consumed.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundary. Even if he believes she won't eat her half, he's going against her stated expectation, which is about mutual respect. Relationships often require compromise beyond physical needs, and the wife's request for equality might be a way to feel valued in the relationship. His plan could undermine that, leading to resentment. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
