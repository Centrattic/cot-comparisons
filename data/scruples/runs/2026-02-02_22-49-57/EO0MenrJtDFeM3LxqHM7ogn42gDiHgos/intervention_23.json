My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe person is going to order a pizza and got permission from their wife to do so using a coupon. The wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks that's unfair because he's bigger and eats more. He argues that a 60-40 split is more appropriate. He mentions that he does things for her, like taking her to a nice sushi place, even though he prefers cheaper options. He's planning to take more than half after she eats her fill, knowing she'll likely eat less than half, and he's not going to feel bad about it. The question is whether he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is against pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive, but she allowed him to get it this time. She's asking for half, maybe as a way to manage their health or budget. The author's reasoning is about body size and appetite, but is that a valid reason to not split it equally? Also, he's balancing it out by taking her to sushi places, which shows he's trying to accommodate her preferences.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of equality in relationships. She mentions they're supposed to be equals, which is a common societal expectation. However, equality doesn't always mean splitting things exactly in half if there are different needs or circumstances. The author is trying to adjust for their different appetites.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see the pizza as a shared meal, and her request for half is about fairness in sharing, not just about her appetite. The author's plan to take more after she eats might be seen as taking advantage, even if she eats less. It could lead to resentment if she feels like her share isn't respected.\n\nBut the author is also doing things for her, like the sushi, which he doesn't enjoy as much. So there's a balance there. Maybe the key is communication. Did they discuss this before? The author mentions he's brought it up before, and she still insists. That suggests she's not open to compromise, but he's willing to let her have her way initially and then take more later. It's a bit of a passive-aggressive approach, though.\n\nIs it fair to let her think she gets half, but then take more? That might not be honest. Maybe they should have a clear agreement before splitting. If he's taking more, he should be upfront about it. But she might feel her request is reasonable. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for expecting more than half despite her request.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In some cultures, splitting equally is expected regardless of appetite. In others, adjusting based on needs is acceptable. The author's approach is a bit sneaky, but he's not forcing her; she can eat her share. However, if he's planning to take more than she's willing to give, even if she eats less, it might be seen as unfair. The wife's insistence on equality could be about feeling respected, not just about the pizza.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's taking more without her knowing, that's a problem. But if he's just taking what he believes is his fair share based on appetite, maybe not. The key is whether he's respecting her wishes. Since she's given permission to get the pizza, but wants half for fairness, and he's not listening, it might be AITA. Alternatively, if his argument is valid, then not. I think it's a bit of a gray area, but since the wife is setting boundaries and he's not honoring them, maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is that the author is trying to be fair based on their different appetites, but the wife is not. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
