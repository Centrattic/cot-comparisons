My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a pizza order and how they split it with their wife.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered pizza using a coupon his wife allowed. He wants to take 60% because he's bigger and eats more, but his wife insists on 50-50. He mentions that he also takes her to sushi 4 times a year, where he eats cheap while she can have expensive. So he's trying to balance things out, giving her more expensive sushi, but expects more pizza.\n\nThe key points here: The wife agreed to the pizza because of the coupon. The husband is justifying the unequal split based on size and appetite. He's also pointing out that he's making sacrifices in sushi to accommodate her preferences. His plan is to let her eat her half first, then take what's left, which he expects would be less than half, so he ends up with more without directly taking more. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's stance is equality, half each, while he's arguing for 60-40 based on needs. Is it fair? Well, in relationships, fairness can be subjective. If both parties have agreed to the arrangement, maybe it's okay. But here, the wife is insisting on equal split despite his reasoning. The husband's plan to take more after she's done might be seen as underhanded, but he's not taking the pizza from her; he's letting her eat her share first. \n\nHowever, the problem is that he's not being honest. He's planning to take more without actually stating that. The wife might feel he's not respecting her agreement if he's taking advantage of the \"half\" she declared. Even if he's bigger, if the agreement was half each, he's going back on that. But maybe the initial agreement wasn't clear. The wife said half each, but he doesn't agree. So he's not following her terms but is using a loophole. \n\nIs that wrong? If the wife is expecting half, and he's not going to honor that, then maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her terms. But then again, he's also making sacrifices in other areas. The answer could hinge on whether the wife is being unreasonable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he agreed to the terms of half each, then he's breaking that. But he didn't agree. So maybe it's a matter of negotiation. \n\nBut the husband's approach is a bit sneaky. He's not directly dividing the pizza as agreed but is using a different method. That could be seen as manipulative. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong for not being upfront and for taking more under the guise of letting her eat first. Alternatively, the wife might be the one being unreasonable if the husband's needs are legitimate. \n\nBut the way the situation is presented, the wife agreed to the coupon purchase, not necessarily the split. The husband is trying to argue that his needs are different. However, if the wife is firm on the split, he's not respecting that. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her terms and is planning to take more than agreed. Alternatively, B (No) if splitting based on body size is fair. \n\nBut in social norms, sharing food as equals is common, so expecting more might be seen as selfish. The husband's reasoning is pragmatic, but the wife's request for equality might be about fairness in the relationship. So he's in the wrong for not honoring her wish for equality despite his own needs. Therefore, answer A.\n"
