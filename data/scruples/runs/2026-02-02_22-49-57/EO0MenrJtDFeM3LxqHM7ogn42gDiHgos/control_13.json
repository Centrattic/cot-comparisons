My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a pizza-sharing disagreement between a husband and wife. The key points here are the expectations of fairness, the ratio of pizza division, and the context of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered a pizza using a coupon, with the wife's permission. He argues that because he's taller, bigger, and eats more, a 60/40 split is fair. The wife insists on a 50/50 split, emphasizing equality. The husband plans to take the remaining pizza after she eats her half if she's not full, even if she has to eat natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the concept of equality vs. equity comes into play. The wife's stance is on equal division, treating both partners the same regardless of their needs. The husband's argument is about equity, where the distribution is adjusted based on individual needs (i.e., he eats more). Both have valid points, but societal norms often lean towards equal sharing in shared expenses unless there's a prior agreement otherwise.\n\nThe husband is using the wife's permission to justify his actions, but the wife agreed to the purchase without stipulating the portion sizes. However, she might have expected a mutual agreement on how to split it. The husband's plan to take more than half after she eats her share could be seen as taking advantage, even if she eats less than her half. The mention of her having to eat natto adds a layer of potential manipulation or lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's actions during sushi nights are presented as a contrast\u2014offering his wife expensive dishes while he eats cheaper ones. This seems like a good gesture, but it doesn't directly relate to the pizza split. The key issue is whether it's fair to override someone's expectation of equal sharing without mutual consent. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective, but respecting each other's boundaries and agreements is crucial. Since the wife clearly stated her expectation of half, the husband disregarding that could be seen as disrespectful, even if his reasoning is based on his needs. The husband's plan to take the leftovers after she eats may come across as selfish or not honoring her initial agreement. \n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's stated preference, even though he has a different view on fairness. The answer would be A, as he's not considering her perspective and the agreed-upon terms of their shared meal.\n"
