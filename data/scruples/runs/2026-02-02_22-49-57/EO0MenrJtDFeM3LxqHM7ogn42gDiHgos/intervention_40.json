My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation involves the author and his wife having a disagreement over how to split a pizza they're going to order. The author feels that because he's taller, bigger, and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. The wife insists on a 50-50 split, citing equality. The author plans to let her eat her half first and then take the remaining from her portion if she stops before finishing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The key issue is the fairness of the pizza split based on physical size versus equality. The author argues that his larger size justifies a bigger share, while the wife emphasizes equal treatment. The author also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, despite not preferring it, which might be a point in his favor about making compromises. However, the wife is doing the same with pizza, but she's not into it, so she wants a 50-50 split.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness. In relationships, equality isn't always about equal shares in every situation. Sometimes it's about mutual respect for each other's desires and needs. The wife might feel that despite differing appetites, they should share equally because it's a joint meal. The author, on the other hand, might see it as fair to adjust portions based on who eats more. But there's also the aspect of communication. The author says he's brought this up before, and she's still not budging. Maybe there's a lack of compromise here.\n\nThe author's plan to let her eat her half and then take from the remaining is a bit underhanded. He's not directly confronting the issue but using a tactic that might leave her without pizza the next day. While it's a way to get what he wants, it could be seen as manipulative. The wife's stance is about equality, but the author's approach might undermine that mutual respect. \n\nAlso, the wife's compromise with sushi is interesting. She's willing to let him choose cheaper options, while he lets her have better sushi, which is a form of mutual concessions. However, the pizza situation is different because he's the one initiating the meal. If he's the one who wants the pizza, maybe it's fair to consider how much each actually wants it. The fact that she doesn't like it as much might mean she would be content with less, but she's still insisting on half. \n\nIn terms of fairness, sometimes in relationships, compromise is key. If the author is bigger and eats more, maybe a 60-40 split is fair, but he needs to communicate this better. However, his plan to take her leftover half is a bit sneaky and might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of trying to outsmart her, maybe he should find a middle ground, like having a 50-50 split but allowing him to have extra on another day or adjust based on how hungry they are that day.\n\nAnother angle is that the wife is trying to maintain equality in the relationship, which is important. The author might be overemphasizing physical differences over emotional or social equality. The key point is whether they're respecting each other's preferences. If the wife is okay with eating less, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if she's genuinely unhappy with the split, that's a different matter.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a valid point about his appetite and size, his approach to enforcing the split by letting her eat first and then taking from her leftover might be seen as not fully respecting her wishes. The wife's insistence on equality might be a way to feel valued in the relationship. The author's plan could be perceived as undermining her needs, even if he believes it's fair. So, he might be in the wrong here because he's not finding a balanced solution that respects both parties' perspectives.\n"
