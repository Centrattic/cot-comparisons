My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The key points here are the expectations of fairness based on body size and eating habits versus the wife's insistence on equal halves.\n\nFirst, the author argues that they should get 60% because they're bigger and eat more. The wife wants equal halves. The user ordered a pizza because they found a coupon and were allowed by their wife. The problem is the division. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. Sharing food equally might be a common practice in some cultures, but in others, people might split based on appetite. The author mentions that they take the wife to sushi four times a year and she gets the expensive plates. So there's a balance in other areas. \n\nThe wife's point about equality might be about fairness in sharing, not just about the physical size. Maybe she feels that equal division is a way to show partnership. The author's plan to take the remaining after she's done is a bit sneaky. They might be trying to maximize their own intake while allowing the wife to think she's getting her half. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, if they were given permission to buy pizza, the division could be a mutual agreement. The author's reasoning is based on physical needs, but maybe the wife's perspective is about emotional or symbolic equality. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author is not willing to meet in the middle, which might be the issue. They also plan to let her eat her half first and then take leftovers, which could come off as manipulative. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they dismiss the wife's request for equality and use a method that's not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, if the couple has discussed this before and the wife is still firm, maybe the author isn't wrong. But the key is how they handle it now. Taking the remaining after she eats might not be fair. Also, the wife might feel disrespected. \n\nSo I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach to dividing the pizza is disrespectful and doesn't address the wife's need for equality. The author should have found a middle ground instead of using a tactic that could be seen as underhanded.\n"
