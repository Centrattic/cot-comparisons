My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband and wife disputing pizza division.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered pizza despite his wife's concerns about health and cost. He got a coupon and she allowed it. Now, he wants 60% because he's bigger and eats more, but she insists on 50-50 equality. He mentions he also takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he orders cheap, while she gets expensive. \n\nHe plans to let her eat her half, then take the remaining from her portion. She might end up with natto for breakfast instead of pizza leftovers. The question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nKey points: The husband acknowledges his wife's preferences and spends on her sushi. The pizza is a personal preference he's getting despite her disapproval. The argument is about fairness based on body size and eating habits. She wants equality, he wants proportionality. \n\nIs it fair to split based on body size? Maybe, but equality in relationships often emphasizes equal consideration. However, the husband's approach of taking more after she's done might be seen as sneaky. Alternatively, he's respecting her initial share but adjusting based on his needs. \n\nHis plan to take leftovers from her portion could be seen as unfair because she thought she was getting half. Even if she eats less, he's not respecting her expectation. The husband's justification about being bigger and eating more is valid, but the method of taking her leftovers without discussion might be the issue. \n\nAlso, the comparison to sushi: he spends more on her expensive sushi, but she's not reciprocating with pizza. Maybe there's an imbalance. However, the pizza is his preference. \n\nThe main conflict is about fairness. If they agreed to split equally, he's not honoring that agreement. His plan undermines her agreement. Even if he believes 60-40 is fair, the way he's enforcing it without mutual agreement could be the problem. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Possibly yes because he's not respecting her terms. She wanted half, he's taking more after she's done. That's not fair. Therefore, maybe answer A. But the user thinks he's not wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, if they didn't agree on a split beforehand, maybe he's not in the wrong for adjusting based on his needs. But the wife had agreed to the pizza purchase, perhaps expecting equal sharing. He's being selfish by taking her leftovers. \n\nI think the answer is A because he's not honoring their initial agreement (she agreed to let him buy pizza but expected equal sharing), and his plan to take more after she eats is undermining that. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
