My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife arguing over how to split a pizza. The wife wants half each, but the husband thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness in relationships. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so there's consent. The husband ordered a large pizza because he likes a lot of it, not just for value. The key point is their differing views on splitting it. The wife wants equal halves, the husband thinks his size justifies more. \n\nThe husband mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheap plates while she can have the expensive ones. Maybe this is balancing things out? The husband plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest, leaving her with natto for breakfast. Is that fair? It might be seen as sneaky or not respecting her wishes. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The wife wants equality in the pizza split, perhaps valuing fairness equally regardless of size. The husband is prioritizing his own needs based on physicality. The question is whether his approach is reasonable. If they've had this discussion before and she still insists on half, the husband's plan might be seen as undermining her by not following through on the agreement. \n\nLegally or morally, there's no law about pizza splitting, but in terms of relationship dynamics, being considerate is key. By not respecting her agreed-upon split and then taking leftovers, he might be in the wrong. Even if he thinks it's fair, enforcing his own ratio without mutual agreement could be seen as unfair. The wife's insistence on equality might be a non-negotiable for her, and the husband's plan could be disrespectful of that. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the husband's actions might be viewed as not respecting the agreed terms, even if they're different from his personal belief. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
