My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the pizza situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband wants to order a pizza, but his wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The husband argues that he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. He also mentions that he brings her to sushi places where he eats cheaper options while she has the expensive ones. He plans to let her eat her half first and then take the remaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is against pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. She allowed it this time with a coupon. The husband wants a larger share because of his size and appetite. The key here is about fairness and mutual respect in their relationship. \n\nThe husband's argument is based on physical needs, but does that justify taking a larger share? The wife might feel that splitting equally is fair, regardless of body size. Relationships often require compromise, and expecting equality in portions might be a way to maintain balance in other areas. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to take more after she's done eating could be seen as manipulative or not respecting her claim. Even if she eats less than half, taking the remainder might make her feel like her agreed-upon share isn't respected. The sushi example shows he's willing to let her have more expensive options, but in this case, he's not reciprocating the same. \n\nThe question is whether fairness is about equal portions or proportional to needs. In many relationships, equal sharing is a way to maintain equality, even if one person eats more. The husband's approach might be seen as selfish, not considering her feelings about fairness. The fact that she's insisting on half might be her way of balancing things out, especially since he's indulging her in sushi. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. He's not respecting her boundary and is planning to take more, which might come across as not valuing her agreement. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
