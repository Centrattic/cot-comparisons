My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author wants 60% to themselves because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife insists on half each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is okay with the pizza being ordered but wants an equal split. The author feels that their body size and appetite justify a larger share. The author also mentions that they compromise by taking her to sushi, but she's still sticking to the half rule.\n\nHmm, fairness can be subjective. The wife might see equality in sharing equally, regardless of appetite. The author is using a practical argument based on physical needs. But does that make it right? Maybe the wife feels that splitting unequally undermines the idea of equality in their relationship. The author's plan to take the leftover from her half after she's done might be seen as sneaky or unfair, even if she only eats part of her share.\n\nAlso, the author's justification about their sushi dinners: they order cheaper for themselves but let her have expensive ones. That shows they do consider her preferences, but the pizza issue is still a point of contention. The wife's insistence on half could be about feeling valued or respected, not just about the food quantity.\n\nIs the author wrong? It's tricky. They have a valid point about appetite, but the wife's perspective on equality is also important. Maybe the problem is that the author isn't considering her feelings about fairness in the relationship. The answer might depend on cultural norms or relationship dynamics. In some contexts, equal sharing is seen as fair, while others adjust based on needs. Since the wife is clear about her expectation, the author's plan to go against it might be seen as disregarding her wishes, making them the asshole. So, likely answer A.\n"
