My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband wants to take 60% because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split. They both have different preferences: he likes pizza as a taste from his home country, and she likes sushi. He orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places the same amount. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is against pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive, but she allowed him to buy it with a coupon. He argues that his body requires more food, so 60-40 makes sense. The wife wants equality, hence 50-50. The husband plans to take more after she eats her half, which might not be fair to her.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting equally is a common practice, especially in relationships where equality is valued. The husband's reasoning is based on physical needs, but the wife's perspective is about fairness and equality. The husband's plan to take more after she eats her half could be seen as manipulative or unfair, even if he's justifying it by his size. \n\nAlso, the fact that he orders sushi for her and cheap plates for himself might balance out the pizza situation. But the key point is whether the 50-50 split is unreasonable. The wife's insistence might be about equality, but the husband's need for more food is a practical consideration. However, communication is key here. If he's been bringing up the 60-40 ratio before and she's still holding firm, maybe he should respect her preference despite his own. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's planning to take more than half without her consent, which could be seen as sneaky. Even if he's trying to be fair based on his needs, the way he's handling it might not respect her wishes. The wife might feel disrespected if he ignores her agreed-upon share. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but there's a better way to handle it. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to be fair based on his needs and circumstances. But some might argue that respecting the agreed-upon 50-50 is important for harmony. Hmm, tricky.\n"
