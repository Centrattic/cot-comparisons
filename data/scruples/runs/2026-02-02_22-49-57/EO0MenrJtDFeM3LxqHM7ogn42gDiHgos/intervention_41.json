My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple splitting a pizza they ordered, with the husband wanting a 60-40 split based on his size and eating habits, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife gave him, which she allowed. He argues that since he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. The wife, on the other hand, expects equality because they're supposed to be equal. The husband plans to let her eat her half but might end up eating more of her half if she doesn't finish it, even though he knows she'll have to eat natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to confirm. The answer should be A or B. \n\nI need to consider fairness in relationships. Equality vs. fairness based on individual needs. The husband acknowledges his wife's dislike for pizza but still wants a larger share. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, where he's more accommodating to her preferences. This mutual exchange might be a point in his favor. However, the wife's insistence on equal portions despite different appetites could be seen as a matter of principle. \n\nIs it fair to split based on size? Some might argue that sharing equally is about fairness, regardless of physical differences. Others might say that considering individual needs is more just. The husband's plan to take more if she doesn't finish her half could be seen as underhanded, even if he's not taking it upfront. \n\nThe fact that the husband is taking her to sushi suggests he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences. However, the pizza situation is about his preference, which isn't being shared equally. The wife might feel that sharing equally is a way to compromise. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the wife agreed to the coupon and the order, then the split is a matter of personal choice. The husband's plan to take advantage if she doesn't finish her half could be seen as manipulative. However, if she's insisting on equal portions, and he's willing to let her eat first, maybe it's not the end of the world. \n\nBut the core issue is whether expecting a 60-40 split is reasonable. The husband's reasoning is based on his physicality, but the wife's argument is about equality. In relationships, compromise is key. If he's been bringing this up before and she's still firm, maybe he should respect her stance rather than trying to outsmart the situation. His plan to take more if she doesn't eat her half could be seen as the real issue here, as it's not upfront and might lead to resentment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's boundary, even if he has a reason. The wife's stance on equality is valid in a relationship context, and his plan to take extra could be seen as undermining that. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
