My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The author ordered a pizza with a coupon, got permission from his wife to buy it. He wants to split it 60-40 based on their sizes, but she insists on 50-50. He argues he eats more because he's bigger. He also mentions he takes her to sushi places where he eats cheaper options, so he's trying to balance things out.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and fairness. He had permission to buy the pizza, so that's covered. The disagreement is about how to split it. The wife wants equal halves, he thinks he should get more. He's considering a strategy where he lets her eat until she's full, then takes the rest, even if it's more than half. That might not be fair because it's using a loophole. But is he in the wrong?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if they both agreed to the purchase, splitting it equally might be expected, especially since they're equals in the partnership. However, his reasoning is based on physical size. But maybe that's not the right approach. Also, he's planning to take advantage of her eating less, which could be seen as manipulative. The wife's insistence on 50-50 could be about equality in the relationship, not just physical needs. The author's plan might come off as sneaky and not respecting her wishes. So, even if he thinks he's justified, the method he's using could be inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her wishes and planning to take more by default. Or B, he's not in the wrong because he's justified in needing more. I need to decide which angle is more important here. The main issue is mutual agreement. Since he got permission, the expectation was mutual sharing. His plan undermines that. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
