My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The key points here are the expectations of fairness in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered a pizza with a coupon and got his wife's permission. He argues that because he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. The wife insists on a 50-50 split. The husband mentions that they both indulge in each other's preferences (he orders pizza, she orders sushi), but he feels the pizza division should reflect his higher consumption. However, he plans to take more than half regardless, which might be where the conflict lies.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's the asshole. The main issue here is fairness in a relationship. Both sides have their perspectives. The husband thinks his physical size justifies more food, while the wife sees equality in terms of mutual respect. But the husband's plan to take more than half, even after she's eaten her fill, could be seen as undermining her wishes. Even if she eats less than half, he's taking more, which might not be fair. Relationships often require compromise. If the wife agreed to the pizza because he got a coupon, maybe she expected a shared enjoyment rather than a strict division. The husband's approach might come off as dismissive of her feelings, even if he's logically justifying it. So, while he might feel entitled, in a relationship, respecting each other's boundaries and agreements is crucial. Hence, he might be in the wrong for not compromising and possibly overstepping.\n"
