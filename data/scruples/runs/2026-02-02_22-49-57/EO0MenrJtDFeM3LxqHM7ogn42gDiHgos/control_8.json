My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered a pizza with a coupon, and the wife wants half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. They have a history of this, with the author sometimes taking more.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so that's a mutual agreement. The author mentions that they both indulge in each other's preferences\u2014like sushi. So there's an exchange here. The wife gets sushi four times a year, and the author gets pizza. The author is trying to be considerate by ordering the kid's menu so she can have the expensive sushi, which shows he's thinking about her preferences.\n\nNow, the main issue is the division of the pizza. The wife wants half, but the author thinks he should get more. The author plans to let her eat until she's full, which might be less than half, then take the rest. He's not outright taking more but intends to use her declared half after she's done. That's a bit sneaky, maybe. But is it wrong?\n\nThe wife's argument is about equality. She might see it as fair to split 50-50 because they're equal as a couple. The author's argument is based on physical needs. However, in a relationship, fairness isn't always strictly about physical needs but mutual respect and compromise. The author is trying to justify his stance by mentioning their exchanges, which seems fair on the surface. But the way he's going to take the remaining pizza after she's done might come off as manipulative. She wanted half to have her fill, but he's planning to take more once she's done. That could be seen as not respecting her initial agreement. \n\nAlso, the author is making a point about their height and size, but that's a physical factor, not necessarily a moral one. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. If the author keeps doing this, it might cause resentment. The key is whether the author's actions are respecting the mutual agreement they had. By letting her eat first and then taking the rest, he's technically allowing her to have her share, but not honoring the 50-50 split she wanted. \n\nBut he did mention that he encourages her to order expensive sushi, showing he's making sacrifices for her. The balance here is tricky. The question is if 50-50 is fair regardless of size or if adjusting based on needs is acceptable. In some contexts, splitting equally is about fairness, but in others, it's about individual needs. However, since the wife specifically asked for half, and the author is ignoring that, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nBut the author's plan is to not outright take 60% but to let her have her fill first. If she ends up eating less than half, then he takes the rest. That's an approach that's more flexible. However, the wife might feel that her initial agreement to split the pizza 50-50 was not respected because the author is not honoring that. \n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the community often looks at intent and respect. The author's intent is to have more pizza, justified by his size. But if the wife's request is a boundary he's crossing by not respecting the agreed split, then he might be in the wrong. However, if there was no explicit agreement, just her expectation, the situation is different. The author says she \"demands\" half, implying she might not have communicated it clearly. But since he's aware of her preference, ignoring it could be seen as not respecting her wishes. \n\nThe answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to balance the mutual indulgence and his needs, but it's a close call. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if respecting her agreed split is more important. The key is whether the initial agreement was 50-50 or not. The wife says she \"expects\" half, so the author's refusal to comply could be seen as the problem. But since the author is planning to let her have her fill first, maybe it's a compromise. \n\nHmm. I think the answer might be B because the author is trying to be fair in his own way and there's an exchange of indulgences. However, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not the pizza. The author's approach could be seen as not respecting her boundary even if he's trying to be fair. It's a bit of a toss-up, but given the context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because there's mutual exchanges and his approach is flexible. But if the agreed split was 50-50, then he is. The story says she \"demanded\" half, but maybe there was no firm agreement. So the answer is B.\n"
