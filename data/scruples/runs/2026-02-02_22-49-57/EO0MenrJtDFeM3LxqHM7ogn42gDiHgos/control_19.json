My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the provided scenario. The author ordered pizza with a coupon, got permission from his wife, but wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger. The wife wants half each. The author plans to let her eat her half, then take the remaining, leaving her with nothing.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase, so the author isn't wrong in getting it. However, the split issue is where the conflict lies. The wife expects equal halves, which is a common way to split things, emphasizing equality. The author argues based on body size and eating habits, suggesting 60-40 as fair. \n\nBut the problem is the author's plan to take the remaining after the wife eats her half, which might not be her full share. That could be seen as sneaky or not respecting her agreed share. The wife's insistence on equality might come from a place of wanting fairness in the relationship, perhaps feeling that equality in portions equals equality as partners, regardless of physical differences.\n\nThe author's reasoning about body size might be valid, but expecting equality in a relationship isn't just about physical needs. It's about mutual respect and compromise. By not honoring her 50% and instead taking the rest, the author might be undermining her feelings of being valued as an equal partner. The joke about natto for breakfast adds a dismissive tone, which could indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, while the author has his reasons, the act of not sticking to the agreed split (even if it's a perceived fair split) and manipulating the leftovers could make him the asshole. The wife's request for equality is about partnership, and the author's approach might be seen as prioritizing his own needs over mutual respect. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
