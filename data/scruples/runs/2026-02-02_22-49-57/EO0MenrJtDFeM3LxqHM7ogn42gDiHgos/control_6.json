My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple disagreeing about how to split a pizza. The husband wants a 60-40 split, citing his bigger size and higher appetite, while the wife insists on 50-50 because \"they're supposed to be equals.\" The husband plans to let her eat her half first, then take the remaining if he's still hungry.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon with his wife's permission. He mentions that he orders pizza 4 times a year, and in return, takes her to sushi 4 times. That seems balanced. The wife's issue is the split, not the frequency or cost. \n\nThe key points here are fairness and mutual respect. The husband argues that physical differences (size, appetite) justify unequal sharing. The wife argues for equality. The husband's plan to take more than half after she eats her fill could be seen as taking advantage if she eats less than half. However, he mentions that he takes her to sushi, which might be a fair exchange for his pizza preference. \n\nBut the problem is the expectation of equal sharing despite differing needs. In many relationships, splitting things equally isn't always fair if people have different needs. However, the husband's plan to take more after she's done might come off as sneaky. On the other hand, the wife's insistence on half could be seen as inflexible, not considering his needs. \n\nThe husband's justification is based on his body size and appetite, which is a valid point. But the way he's planning to take the remaining pizza could be seen as undermining her agreement. However, since he's already gotten her permission to order the pizza, maybe the split was never discussed. So, maybe the issue is that the wife is imposing a rule without considering his needs, while the husband is trying to assert his own. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting resources based on need is often considered fairer than equal splits. So the husband's 60-40 might be fair. However, the way he's going to take the remaining after she eats could be problematic if she's left with nothing. But he says he'll let her eat her fill first. If she eats less than half, then he takes the rest, which is fair. \n\nThe wife's insistence on half might be more about equality as a principle rather than practicality. The husband is trying to balance his needs against hers. In relationships, compromise is key, but so is respecting each other's preferences. Since both have different preferences (pizza vs. sushi), the husband's approach to share sushi more generously might already be a compromise. \n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is wrong for not agreeing to 50-50. If the wife agreed to the pizza order knowing he likes it more, but then insists on equal sharing, maybe she's being unreasonable. The husband's plan is to let her have her share first, which is fair. But taking the rest if he's still hungry is his right, especially if she's content. \n\nTherefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. The wife's demand for equality might be less considerate of his needs. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
