My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband wants to take 60% because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband ordered pizza using a coupon his wife gave him. He argues that due to his size and appetite, he should get more. The wife, on the other hand, wants equal halves because of equality. The husband has a history of splitting things this way and plans to let the wife eat her half first, then take the rest of her half once he's full. He's also mentioned that he takes her to sushi places, which she likes more than him.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. The wife's stance is based on equality, which is a common principle in relationships. She might feel that splitting things equally is fair, especially since they're a team. The husband's argument is based on physical needs\u2014eating more because he's bigger. But in many relationships, equality isn't just about physical needs but also about mutual respect and compromise.\n\nThe husband's approach of taking more after the wife has eaten her half could be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but it's a bit sneaky. He's essentially planning to take advantage of her initial portion. That might come off as inconsiderate, even if he's not taking it all upfront. The wife might feel slighted, thinking she's not getting her fair share even after eating first.\n\nAlso, the husband's justification of their past sushi outings might not balance things out. He's taking her to a place she likes, but he's choosing cheaper options for himself. That could be a separate issue, but it's not directly related to the pizza split. The main point is the fairness in splitting the pizza.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, open communication is key. If the husband has brought up the 60-40 split before and she's consistently refused, continuing to act on his own plan without discussing it further might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to resentment. The wife's insistence on half might stem from feeling that equality is important, even if it's not strictly based on appetite.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people often have different views. Some might side with the husband's practical approach, while others think equality matters more. However, the act of secretly taking more after she eats her share could be seen as underhanded, which might tip the scales towards him being the asshole.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting his wife's wishes and for the sneaky plan to take more. Even if he's physically bigger, relationships often require compromise. The wife's demand for equality is her way of ensuring fairness in the relationship, and the husband's plan undermines that by not honoring her stated wishes upfront.\n"
