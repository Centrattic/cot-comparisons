My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The author argues that since they're bigger and eat more, a 60-40 split is fair. The wife wants equal halves. The author also mentions they compromise in other ways, like taking her to sushi.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness. The author's reasoning is based on their physical size and appetite. But the wife's perspective is about equality in the relationship. Splitting things equally is a common way people share expenses or food, especially in partnerships. The fact that the author uses a coupon and got permission might not change the expectation of equal sharing from the wife's side.\n\nThe author's plan to take more after she's full could be seen as taking advantage. Even if she eats less, taking the leftover half might make her feel disrespected. Relationships often require mutual respect and compromise. The author's approach might come off as selfish, even if they have a logical reason.\n\nAlso, the author mentions other compromises, like choosing cheap sushi for themselves. But the pizza issue might be about more than just food\u2014it could symbolize differing values on fairness. The wife's insistence on equality might reflect her belief in shared responsibilities, while the author prioritizes personal needs. \n\nIn the end, fairness can be subjective. However, the key point is that the wife has agreed to the pizza purchase but still expects an equal split. The author's plan to take more could be seen as disregarding her agreed-upon terms, making them the asshole. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if the author's reasoning holds weight. Maybe not, because mutual agreement on sharing terms is important in relationships.\n"
