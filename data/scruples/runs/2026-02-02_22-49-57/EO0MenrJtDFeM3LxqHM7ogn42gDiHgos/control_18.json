My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife disagreeing on how to split a pizza. The husband argues that because he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. The wife wants an equal 50-50 split, citing equality. The husband plans to let the wife eat her half first, then take the remaining from her half, even if she doesn't finish it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is based on physical size and dietary needs. He's bigger, so he needs more food. The wife, on the other hand, is emphasizing equality in the relationship. She might feel that splitting things equally is a way to maintain fairness and balance in their shared expenses and activities.\n\nThe husband also mentions he orders pizza only four times a year and takes her to a nice sushi place the same number of times, trying to accommodate her preferences. However, he orders cheaper items for himself while she has the more expensive ones. This shows he's making an effort to balance their preferences in other areas.\n\nBut when it comes to the pizza, he's not willing to split it equally. The key issue here is whether fairness is based on individual needs versus equality in the relationship. The husband's approach might be seen as pragmatic but could come off as dismissive of his wife's feelings. By planning to take more after she eats her half, he's essentially undermining her initial allocation, which she might see as a betrayal of trust or a lack of respect for her wishes.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to let her eat first and then take the remaining from her half could be perceived as manipulative. Even if she doesn't finish her half, he's taking more than he's supposed to, which might hurt her feelings. The wife's insistence on equal shares could stem from a desire for fairness in their partnership, not just about the food but about mutual respect and compromise.\n\nIn relationships, fairness often involves both practical considerations and emotional aspects. While the husband's physical needs are valid, the wife's request for equality is about maintaining a balanced partnership. The husband's response, however, might not consider her emotional perspective, leading to potential resentment. The act of secretly taking more after she's eaten her half could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the husband's actions, while based on his own logic, might be incorrect because they disregard his wife's feelings about equality and mutual respect. The correct answer would be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
