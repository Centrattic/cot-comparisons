My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about dividing a pizza between a husband and wife.\n\nFirst, the husband wants to order a pizza using a coupon he found, which his wife allowed. He wants to take 60% because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split. The husband argues that they should split it based on their sizes and appetites. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places and lets her order expensive items, but she still wants equal pizza shares. His plan is to let her eat her half and then take the rest of her half because she won't finish it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are mutual respect, compromise, and fairness. The wife values equality in sharing, while the husband thinks it's fair based on their physical differences. The husband's solution is to let her eat her half and then take the leftovers, which might seem like he's taking advantage of her eating habits. \n\nBut wait, is the husband respecting her boundaries? If she said half is hers, but he's planning to take more, even if she doesn't finish it, does that make him wrong? It could be seen as undermining her decision, even if he believes it's fair. Communication seems key here. Maybe they should talk about their preferences more. But the husband is taking a passive-aggressive approach, which might not be respectful. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is based on his own needs, but the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship. If they have different food preferences, like sushi vs. pizza, the husband's approach might not be balanced. However, the wife allowed the coupon, so maybe she's already compromising. \n\nI think the husband is in the wrong because he's not honoring the agreement he made with his wife. Even if he thinks it's unfair, he agreed to her terms when she gave permission. Breaking that agreement, even if he's planning to take more, could be seen as dishonest. The answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her boundaries and is acting on his own terms despite her stated expectations.\n"
