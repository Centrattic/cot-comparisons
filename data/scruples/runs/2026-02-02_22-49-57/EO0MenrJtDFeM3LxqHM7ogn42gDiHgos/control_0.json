My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. He ordered pizza despite her disapproval because of health and cost, but he found a coupon and got her permission. Now, she wants half the pizza each, but he thinks he should get 60% because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nHmm, first, they already agreed that he could get the pizza. Maybe that's a starting point. She gave permission, so maybe she expected him to share it. But he's arguing about the portion sizes. The wife wants equal halves, but he thinks his larger share is fair. \n\nHe mentions he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year and lets her order the expensive stuff. So he's making an effort to accommodate her tastes, even if he prefers cheaper options. That seems like he's trying to be fair. But she's not reciprocating in the pizza situation. \n\nThe author's plan is to let her eat her fill first, which would be less than half, then take the rest. So he's not taking the whole pizza, just adjusting based on her actual consumption. But he's planning to do this without feeling guilty. \n\nIs it fair to split based on body size and appetite? Maybe that's subjective. But the wife insists on equality, which could be about fairness in the relationship. She might feel that equal sharing is important as a principle. However, if he's bigger and eats more, maybe his needs are different. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. Did they discuss this before? The author says he's brought it up before, but she still demands half. Maybe there's an underlying issue about how they handle disagreements. Also, he's using a strategy that might make her feel like her share is being taken away, which could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to balance his own needs while making sacrifices (like the sushi thing). The wife might see the pizza as a way to compromise, but he's pushing back. It's a bit of a gray area. But since he's using a passive-aggressive approach\u2014letting her eat first then taking the rest\u2014it might not be respectful. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. If the wife wants equal share and he's disregarding that, maybe he's not respecting her wishes. Even if he has a different view on fairness, he should consider her perspective. The answer might be A (he's wrong) because he's not honoring her agreement and is acting in a way that could be seen as manipulative.\n"
