My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting pizza between him and his wife. He ordered a pizza using a coupon she allowed him to use. He wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while she insists on 50-50. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he eats cheap while she can get the expensive stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wife is okay with him buying pizza but wants half. He argues that his body size and appetite justify a larger share. He's planning to take more than half after she eats her \"fill,\" even though she said it's hers. That might be where the issue is. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's respecting her initial permission for buying pizza, but then his plan involves taking more after she's done eating. That sounds like he's not honoring the agreement. If she agreed to let him buy it on the condition that it's split equally, he's undermining that by taking more. \n\nAlso, the argument about body size and eating more might be a justification for him to take more, but maybe equality in a relationship isn't just about physical needs. She might see fairness as equal shares because they're equals in the relationship, not based on size. \n\nHe also mentions that he takes her to sushi, where he eats cheap and she gets expensive. That seems like a balance. But with pizza, he's trying to take more. Is that inconsistent? If he's willing to let her have better sushi (which is expensive), but not more pizza, maybe there's an imbalance in how he's applying fairness. \n\nHis plan to take more after she eats her half could be seen as deceitful or not respecting her share. Even if she eats less than half, he's taking more than he agreed to. If she agreed to the purchase under the condition of equal sharing, he's violating that. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he's not honoring the agreement and his actions might be perceived as unfair despite his reasoning. The key is that she set the condition of half each, and he's planning to circumvent that, which could be seen as unethical in the context of their agreement.\n"
