My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author orders pizza 4 times a year, uses a coupon with the wife's permission, and wants a 60-40 split because they're bigger. The wife insists on splitting it 50-50, citing equality. The author plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest if she doesn't finish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author gets permission to buy the pizza, which is important. They ordered a large because they like a lot, not just value. The wife's argument is about equality, but the author argues based on body size and metabolism. The author also mentions they take her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but they order cheaper items, which might be a point about fairness in other areas.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's plan is to let the wife eat her half, and if she doesn't finish, take the leftovers. The wife might end up not eating her full share, but the author doesn't feel bad about it. Is this fair?\n\nFrom an equality standpoint, splitting equally is about fairness, but the author's argument is about individual differences. However, the wife might feel that since they both contributed to the purchase (using a coupon with her permission), they should split it equally. The author's plan could be seen as taking advantage of the situation if the wife doesn't finish her share, which could lead to resentment.\n\nAlso, the author's justification of physical size might not be a strong enough reason to override the wife's expectations of equality. Relationships often require compromise, and the author's approach might be seen as not respecting the wife's wishes. The fact that the author is planning to take her leftovers without considering her feelings could make them the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to get their needs met, which is understandable. But the key is whether they're respecting the agreed-upon terms. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, but perhaps didn't specify the split. If the author had discussed the split beforehand, it might be different. The author's plan to take more after she eats her half could be seen as sneaky, which might tip the balance toward them being in the wrong.\n"
