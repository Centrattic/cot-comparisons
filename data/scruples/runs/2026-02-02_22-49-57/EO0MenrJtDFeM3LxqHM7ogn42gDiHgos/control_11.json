My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation involves a husband and wife where the wife wants an equal split. The husband thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In Japan, sharing might be more about equality, but the husband's reasoning is based on physical needs. However, the wife agreed to the pizza because he found a coupon, so maybe she expected a fair split. But the husband is planning to take more than half anyway, which might be seen as dishonest if he promised to split it equally.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year. She orders expensive dishes while he gets cheap ones. That seems like he's making an effort for her, which might balance things out. But maybe the pizza situation is about his personal preference versus hers. The wife might feel her health concerns are being ignored if he takes more, even if it's not a regular occurrence.\n\nThe key point is the husband's plan to take more than agreed. Even if he thinks it's fair, he's not respecting her agreement. The wife wants equality, and he's circumventing that. The wife might feel disrespected if he doesn't honor her terms. So, the husband is not in the wrong if both agree to different splits, but since he's not following through on the agreed 50-50 split, he's being dishonest. Therefore, he might be an asshole.\n"
