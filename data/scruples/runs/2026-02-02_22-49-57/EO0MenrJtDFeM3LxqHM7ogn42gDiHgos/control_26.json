My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting a 60-40 split of the pizza instead of 50-50. The wife wants half each, but the author argues he should get more because he's bigger and eats more. They both have different preferences in food; he likes pizza more, she likes sushi more. They compromise by going to each other's preferred spots a few times a year.\n\nFirst, the main issue is fairness in splitting the pizza. The wife sees equality as 50-50, which is a common way to split things equally. The author, however, thinks his physical needs (being bigger) justify getting a larger share. But is that a valid argument? The problem is that the pizza was ordered with the wife's permission, possibly under the assumption of a 50-50 split. The husband's previous plan to let her eat her half and then take the rest he's left with might come off as manipulative or not respecting her share.\n\nAlso, the husband's approach of letting her eat her fill first, which he expects will be less than half, then taking the rest might not be fair. If she's allowed to eat her half, even if she eats less, maybe she's still entitled to it. The author's plan might be seen as taking advantage of her, even if he's not forcing her to eat all of it. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement. The wife agreed to the pizza under the condition of a 50-50 split. The husband's argument based on body size might be a personal preference, but the wife values equality. Since they have different preferences in other meals (sushi vs. pizza), maybe the pizza should be about his preference, but he's still splitting it equally. However, the author is now trying to adjust the split because he eats more, which complicates things. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respect and compromise. The wife has given permission, so she might feel the agreement was implicit. The husband's plan to take more after she eats could be seen as undermining her consent. Even if she eats less, she might still feel entitled to her half. The author's approach might be perceived as selfish, not respecting her share, leading to the \"asshole\" label. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is manipulating the situation to his advantage despite her expectations of equality. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
