My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing about splitting a pizza. The husband wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split because they're equal.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments presented. The husband mentions that he ordered the pizza because he has a coupon and his wife gave permission. He justifies the larger share due to his size and eating habits. The wife, on the other hand, wants equal portions because of equality. The husband also points out that he takes her to sushi places where he orders cheaper for himself but lets her have the expensive ones. He argues that he's being fair there, so the pizza split should be different.\n\nI should consider cultural context. In Japan, sharing equally might be more emphasized, but the husband is from a different country and values his own preferences. However, since they are a couple, mutual respect and compromise are key. The husband's plan to take more than half after letting the wife eat her share might come off as manipulative or unfair, even if she eats less. It could be seen as not respecting her wishes. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in shared expenses. The husband agreed to buy the pizza, so maybe the compromise should have been made beforehand. The key question is whether expecting a 60-40 split is unreasonable. Since they are equals, the wife's stance might be valid. The husband's approach of taking what he wants after could be perceived as selfish, hence making him the asshole.\n"
