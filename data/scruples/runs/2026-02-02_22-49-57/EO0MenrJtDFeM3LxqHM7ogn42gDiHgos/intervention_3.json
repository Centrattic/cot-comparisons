My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple disagreeing over how to split a pizza. The husband wants a 60-40 split in his favor, while the wife insists on 50-50. The husband argues that because he's taller and bigger, he eats more, so 60% is fair. The wife wants equality.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The husband ordered pizza despite his wife's concerns about health and cost because he has a coupon and she gave permission. He's making an effort to take her to a nice sushi place four times a year, even though he doesn't like the expensive options she does. That shows reciprocity on his part.\n\nNow, the main issue is the pizza split. The wife wants equal portions, which is about fairness in sharing. The husband, on the other hand, bases his request on their physical differences\u2014eating more because he's bigger. But is that a valid reason to override the principle of equality in a relationship?\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In some cultures, sharing equally in meals is important for balance. However, personal preferences and needs can vary. The husband's argument is practical\u2014he eats more, so he needs more food. But his wife might see fairness as about equality, not just physical needs.\n\nThe husband's plan to let her eat her fill first and then take the rest is a bit sneaky. He's taking advantage of her possibly not finishing her half. That might come across as manipulative, even if he's not directly forcing her. The wife's compromise of 50-50 is a standard way to handle shared resources, promoting mutual respect.\n\nAlso, the husband's justification that he's making an effort with sushi (even though he prefers cheaper options) could be seen as a counterbalance to his pizza consumption. But the key point is whether splitting pizza 50-50 is unreasonable. Some might argue that if they agreed on the purchase together, splitting it equally is fair, regardless of individual appetite. Others might side with the husband, saying that physical differences justify different portions.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the wife's insistence on equality could be about feeling valued and respected. If the husband consistently argues for unequal splits, it might lead to resentment. However, if the wife's health is a concern, maybe the pizza isn't the main issue, but rather their broader dietary preferences and compromises.\n\nThe husband's approach of taking the remaining pizza after she's full might not be seen as fair by her. It's a form of taking without direct negotiation, which could be perceived as inconsiderate. The question then is whether the husband's actions are respectful of his wife's wishes, even if he has a different view on fairness.\n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have valid points, the husband's plan to outsmart his wife's 50-50 agreement by taking more after she eats might be seen as inconsiderate. The principle of mutual agreement and respect in shared decisions is key here. So the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong.\n"
