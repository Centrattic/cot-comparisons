My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves ordering pizza, and there's a disagreement over how to split it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband wants to get pizza, which his wife is not a big fan of because it's unhealthy and expensive. He found a coupon and got her permission. He orders a large pizza not just for value, but because he likes a lot of pizza. The wife is insisting on an equal split (half each), but the husband thinks he should get more because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, and he orders cheaper items while she gets the more expensive ones. He plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest, even if it means she can't eat leftover pizza the next day.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is fairness in splitting the pizza. The wife's argument is about equality, while the husband argues for a 60/40 split based on their physical needs. The husband also points out that he's making sacrifices by ordering cheaper sushi for himself while she gets the better stuff. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms and fairness. Equality vs. equity. The wife might feel that splitting equally is fair because they're partners, but the husband thinks equity (different shares based on need) is fairer. However, the husband's plan to take the leftover after she's done might be seen as unfair because he's not respecting her share even if she doesn't finish it. That could come off as sneaky or not honoring the agreement he made. Also, the mention of her having to eat natto instead of pizza might be a passive-aggressive tactic, which isn't great for a relationship. \n\nThe fact that he's being dishonest in his plan (letting her eat until she's full but taking the rest he's not upfront about) might be the key point. Even if he believes 60/40 is fair, the way he's handling it could be seen as manipulative. Also, the wife agreed to half because maybe she doesn't like pizza as much, so she might not mind eating less, but the husband is not respecting that. \n\nOn the other hand, he did get her permission to order pizza, and perhaps she agreed to the condition that she gets half. But if he's willing to adjust based on consumption, maybe there's room for compromise. But his plan to take the remaining half after she's done seems underhanded. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not being transparent and is taking advantage of the situation in a way that could hurt their relationship. The answer might be A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
