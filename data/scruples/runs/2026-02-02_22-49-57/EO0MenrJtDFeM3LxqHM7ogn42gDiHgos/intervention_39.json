My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The main issue is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants a larger share (60-40) because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50. The author feels he's justified in taking more, especially since he's the one ordering it using a coupon they agreed on.\n\nFirst, consent: The wife gave permission for the pizza, so she's not against the order. The problem is the split. The author argues that body size and appetite should matter. But fairness in relationships often involves mutual compromise. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective. However, the author's plan to take more than half by letting her eat her fill first and then taking the rest might be seen as manipulative. It could also set a precedent where he takes advantage of her eating less, which might not be fair in the long run. The key is whether both feel respected and heard. The author's approach might undermine mutual respect, making him the asshole. So, answer A.\n"
