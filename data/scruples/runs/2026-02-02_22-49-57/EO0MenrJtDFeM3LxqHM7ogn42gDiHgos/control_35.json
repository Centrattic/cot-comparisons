My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple splitting a pizza. The wife wants half each, but the husband thinks he should get 60% because he's bigger and eats more. The husband found a coupon, got her permission to order, and he likes pizza a lot. He also mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper items. She insists on half the pizza, and he plans to take more once she's done eating her half.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about fairness and mutual agreement. The wife wants equality (50-50), while the husband thinks it should be based on body size. The husband argues that since he's bigger, he needs more. But the wife might see it as unequal treatment despite their physical differences.\n\nThe husband is using a strategy to take more by letting her eat her half first. That seems manipulative. If he's taking advantage of her eating habits, that could be where the issue is. The wife might feel disrespected if he's not honoring the agreed split. Even if he thinks she'll eat less, the initial agreement was 50-50. By planning to take more, he's violating that agreement, which could make him the asshole.\n\nAlso, the husband's justification about body size might be seen as a way to rationalize taking more without considering her feelings. The wife wants equality, which is a common expectation in relationships. The husband might need to find another way to express his preferences, like ordering a larger pizza for himself or splitting it differently each time, but not using a strategy to get more after she's done.\n\nIn terms of the sushi comparison, he's doing something she likes but choosing cheaper options. Maybe that's a separate issue, but the pizza situation is about a direct agreement. The main conflict is about respecting her terms versus his own. The husband's plan to take more than half after she's done could be seen as dishonest, thus making him the asshole.\n"
