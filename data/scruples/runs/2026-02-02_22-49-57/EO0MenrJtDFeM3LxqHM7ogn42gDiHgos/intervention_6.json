My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their spouse.\n\nSo, the main points are: the husband wants to order a pizza using a coupon, which his wife allowed. He wants a large pizza because he eats a lot. The wife insists on a 50-50 split, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he eats cheaper options while she gets the expensive ones. The wife still wants half the pizza. The husband plans to let her eat her share first, then take the rest himself, even if she's left with natto for breakfast.\n\nHmm. The key here is fairness in the relationship. The wife is setting a rule (50-50) that the husband disagrees with. He argues based on his physical size and eating habits. But the wife's reasoning is about equality. However, the husband points out that he's making an effort by taking her to sushi, but he's not getting the same value from it. So there's an imbalance there too. \n\nIs it about equality versus practicality? The wife's stance on equality might be about fairness in sharing, but the husband's argument is based on his needs. The husband's plan to take more after she eats her half could be seen as manipulative, but he's doing it without making her feel bad. \n\nI think the core issue is whether their agreement should be about equal sharing regardless of individual needs. The wife's demand for half is about equality, but maybe the husband's needs are different. However, the husband is also using the sushi example to show that he's giving her more, but he's not getting the same. That might balance things out. \n\nThe problem is the husband's approach to taking more after she's done. If she's allowed to eat her half first, but he takes the rest, that might not be fair. Even if she ends up eating less, he's taking advantage of the situation. But he's not forcing her to stop eating when she's full. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's trying to get what he feels he needs, but the way he's doing it could be seen as unfair. However, the wife's insistence on 50-50 might not consider his actual needs. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the husband is using a tactic to get more, even if it's not directly against the agreement, it might be seen as sneaky. \n\nAlternatively, splitting the pizza 60-40 could be more practical. But the wife's insistence on equality is her right. The husband's plan to let her eat first and then take the rest might not be fair because it's not based on mutual agreement. So maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms. But if she's okay with him taking the rest after she's done, then maybe it's okay. \n\nWait, the wife is the one who set the terms. The husband is not following them but is trying to work around it. That could be seen as being in the wrong. Even if he feels 60-40 is fair, he's not honoring the agreed-upon 50-50. Unless they can talk about it and adjust the terms. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that he is in the wrong because he's breaking the agreed terms, even if he's trying to get what he feels he needs. The wife's request for equality is part of their agreement, and he's circumventing it. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
