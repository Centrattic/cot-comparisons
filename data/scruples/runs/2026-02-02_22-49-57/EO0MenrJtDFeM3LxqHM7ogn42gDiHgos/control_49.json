My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a pizza using a coupon with his wife's permission. He wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but his wife insists on a 50-50 split, citing equality.\n\nHmm, first, the wife agreed to the purchase. The author's reasoning is about physical size and eating habits. But the wife's argument is about equality in the relationship. The key here might be about mutual respect and compromise. The author plans to let the wife eat her half first, then take some of hers, which he knows might leave her with natto for breakfast. That seems a bit sneaky or manipulative.\n\nBut then, the author also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year and encourages her to order expensive dishes. So he's making sacrifices for her tastes. However, the pizza situation is about his preference. The wife's insistence on equal halves might be about fairness in the relationship, not just food. The author's approach could be seen as exploiting the situation to get more for himself, even if he's bigger. \n\nIs it fair to split based on body size? Maybe not in a relationship where equality is valued. The author's plan to take more after she's done eating her half is underhanded. Even if he believes he eats more, he's taking what she's allocated, which could be seen as not respecting her wishes. The wife might feel her needs aren't considered. So the author might be in the wrong for not compromising and for using a manipulative strategy.\n"
