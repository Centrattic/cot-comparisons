My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her half first, and then take the remaining part of her half if she doesn't finish it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context they provided. The wife agreed to the coupon purchase, so she's okay with getting pizza. The author mentions that they have a balance in other areas, like sushi. He takes her to a nice sushi place where she can order expensive items, while he orders cheaper kid's meals. So, there's a sense of giving her what she likes more, even if it costs more for him. \n\nNow, the pizza issue is about splitting it equally versus proportionally. The author argues that his body requires more food, hence a bigger share. The wife, on the other hand, wants equality. The key here is whether fairness is determined by equal portions or by need. \n\nThe author's plan to let his wife eat first and then take from her leftovers might seem a bit sneaky. But is that unethical? If she's okay with the initial agreement of splitting the pizza, then maybe she's not being forced to eat all her half. However, by his plan, he's essentially taking more without her knowledge. That could be seen as underhanded. \n\nBut wait, the author says he's not going to feel bad about it. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife might feel that the agreement was 50-50, and he's going back on that. The author might see it as fair based on their physical needs. There's also the aspect of compromise in relationships. If he's willing to give up other things for her (like sushi), maybe she's expected to compromise on the pizza. \n\nBut the wife's insistence on equality could be about fairness beyond just calories. It could be about equality in the relationship, not just food. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of her feelings about equality. Even if he's bigger, maybe she values equal treatment more. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether fairness is about equal share or proportional needs. The author's plan could be seen as taking advantage, even if he thinks it's fair. Relationships often require compromise, and maybe the author isn't considering his wife's perspective enough. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks at intentions and whether the person crossed a line. The author's intention is to get a fairer share based on his needs, but the method of taking more after she eats might be the problem. \n\nAlternatively, if the wife agreed to the coupon and the purchase, maybe she's given up her right to control the split. But the initial agreement was that she gave permission for the pizza, not necessarily the split. \n\nI think the key point is that the author is going against the agreed-upon 50-50 split by taking more, even if he thinks it's fair. That might make him the asshole because he's not respecting her terms, even if he has his own reasoning. So, answer A (Yes, in the wrong). But wait, some might argue that he's just adjusting based on his needs. However, the method he uses to take more could be seen as manipulative. So maybe A is correct.\n"
