My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered a pizza using a coupon, with the wife's permission. The wife wants half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on equal halves. The author plans to let her eat until she's full from her half, then eat the rest of her half, leaving her none.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual compromise and fairness. The wife allowed him to order pizza, so she's already compromising by accepting it despite her preferences. The author, on the other hand, is trying to adjust the split based on their eating habits. However, he's being a bit sneaky by planning to take more than his half after she eats her share. That might be the issue.\n\nThe wife's stance is about equality, which is a common way to split things. The author's argument is about physical differences. But in relationships, fairness can be subjective. The author's plan to take the leftovers from her half might come off as unfair, even if he thinks she'll only eat part of it. It could lead to resentment or feeling disrespected.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he takes her to sushi but eats cheap options, which shows he's trying to accommodate her preferences. But she's not reciprocating in the pizza scenario. However, the main issue is how he's handling the pizza split. His method of taking her leftovers might not be fair, even if he thinks she won't need it. People's appetites can vary, and expecting her to eat less than half could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it depends on intention and respect. If the author is being respectful and trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. But his plan to take from her share after she's done might be seen as taking advantage. The wife's insistence on equal halves could be about fairness in the agreement. If they agreed to equal splits when he orders pizza, he should stick to that, even if he eats more. Otherwise, it's not respecting her terms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the agreed-upon split and trying to manipulate the situation to his advantage. The answer could be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe the wife is being rigid, but the author's method is sneaky. Hmm.\n"
