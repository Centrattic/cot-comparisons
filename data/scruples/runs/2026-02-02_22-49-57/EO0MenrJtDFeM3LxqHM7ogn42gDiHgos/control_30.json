My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza using a coupon, and their wife insists on a 50-50 split despite the author's argument that a 60-40 split is fairer because he's bigger and eats more. The author plans to let her eat what she wants and then take the rest, even if it means she can't have leftovers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed the pizza order because of the coupon, but she's strict about the split. The author feels that his body size justifies a larger share. They both have different preferences for other meals, like sushi. The author's approach is to not enforce the 50-50 split but to let consumption determine the actual split.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, fairness can be subjective. The wife values equality, while the author values proportionality based on need. The author isn't forcing the wife to eat less; he's just taking what he wants after she eats. That could be seen as fair because he's respecting her choice. However, the wife might feel disrespected because she set the initial condition of a 50-50 split, and the author is disregarding that. But the author is also meeting her expectations by ordering pizza despite her disapproval of its health and cost aspects. \n\nThe key points are mutual compromise. The author is making an effort by taking her preferences into account with the sushi outings. The wife's insistence on equal division might be more about principle than actual consumption. The author's plan to let her eat first and then take the rest might not be as bad as it sounds, especially if she eats less than half. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't being malicious. He's just asserting his own needs based on his circumstances. The wife's insistence could be seen as rigid, but the author isn't violating any agreement beyond what he's willing to accept. Since the wife agreed to the pizza order, maybe the split is a matter of personal choice. The author's approach isn't unfair if it's based on actual consumption rather than pre-splitting the pizza. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not the asshole) because the author is respecting her initial agreement and adjusting based on actual eating habits. However, some might argue that the author is disregarding the wife's wishes, but since she can choose to eat less, it's a matter of personal choice. The wife might have to live with the consequences of her own rules.\n"
