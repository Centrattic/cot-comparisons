My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between a couple. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger, while his wife insists on 50-50 because of equality. The author plans to take more than half by letting her eat her fill first, then taking the rest.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The wife gave permission for the pizza, which shows she's not against it entirely. She might be trying to balance their health or expenses. The author values pizza as a cultural comfort and compensates by taking her to sushi, but he feels his portion should be larger due to his size and appetite.\n\nThe key points: The wife wants equality, the author thinks it's based on physical needs. The author's plan is to let her eat her half first, but then take the rest, which might leave her with natto for breakfast. The question is whether his actions are inconsiderate.\n\nNow, considering fairness. While physical size might influence appetite, relationships often require compromise. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in sharing expenses or health considerations. The author's approach could be seen as taking advantage of her initial agreement to split 50-50, then changing tactics. That might come off as manipulative.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife \"repeatedly demanded\" the 50-50 split, so there's a history of disagreement. His plan to let her eat first but then take the rest could be seen as passive-aggressive. The natto comment adds a bit of humor but might indicate he's not considering her feelings.\n\nIn terms of relationship health, being considerate of each other's perspectives is important. The author's stance is based on personal needs, but the wife's insistence on equality could be about respect and fairness in their shared life. The author might be overstepping by not respecting her terms even though he's found a way to get her to agree. His plan to take more without acknowledging her feelings could be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's terms, even if his reasoning is about physical needs. Relationships often require giving and taking, and he's prioritizing his own needs over her agreement. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
