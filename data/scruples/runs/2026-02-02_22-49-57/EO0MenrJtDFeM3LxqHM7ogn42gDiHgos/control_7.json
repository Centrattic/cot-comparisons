My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the scenario is that they ordered pizza, and the wife wants half of it, but the author thinks it should be 60-40 because he's bigger and eats more. They have a history of the author taking pizza and her taking sushi four times a year. The author's plan is to let her eat her half, but if she doesn't finish it, he'll take the rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness. The wife wants equality, half each, which is a common way to split things. But the author argues for a split based on their different appetites. The key point here is whether splitting by appetite is fair or if equality is the standard. \n\nThe author mentions that he also takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper, while she gets the expensive stuff. That seems like he's giving her more in terms of expense, but he's not taking the same amount of food. So maybe there's an imbalance there. But the pizza situation is about quantity, not cost.\n\nThe wife is insisting on half because they are supposed to be equals. The author, on the other hand, is splitting based on physical needs. But maybe the wife's request is about fairness in sharing the meal together, not just calories. Also, the author's plan to take the leftover half of her portion after she eats might come off as manipulative or not respecting her agreed-upon half. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if they agreed to the purchase because the wife allowed him to buy it, then maybe the terms of the agreement were half each. But the author is trying to renegotiate based on his own needs. Also, the author's approach of letting her eat her half first and then taking the rest if she doesn't finish could be seen as not honoring the initial agreement. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author has brought this up before, but the wife is firm on her stance. So maybe the author should have found another solution instead of trying to undermine her agreement. The fact that he's planning to take more without discussing it again might be the issue. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author might think 60-40 is fair, but the wife might feel that equality is important for her. If they can't agree, maybe the author should find another way to satisfy his craving without making her feel her terms are ignored. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not respecting the agreed-upon split and is planning to take more without negotiation. That could make him the asshole. Answer A.\n"
