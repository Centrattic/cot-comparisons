My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation involves the author and his wife having a disagreement over how to split a pizza they ordered. The author argues that because he's taller, bigger, and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. His wife wants an equal split, emphasizing equality. He mentions that he orders pizza four times a year and takes her to sushi places similarly, but he's willing to let her eat her fill and then take the rest of her half, leaving her with natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of their argument. The wife's stance on equality is a common principle in relationships, promoting fairness through equal sharing regardless of physical differences. The author, on the other hand, is basing his argument on his physical needs. But does that justify an unequal split? Maybe not, because fairness in relationships often involves compromise beyond just physical needs. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take more than half after she eats her fill might be seen as taking advantage of her initial choice. If she eats less than half, he takes the remainder, which could lead to her not having leftovers, forcing her to eat natto the next day. This could be perceived as unfair, as he's benefiting more from the situation while she's left with less. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author is respecting his wife's wishes. Even if he believes his split is fair, the wife has clearly stated her expectation of equality. By not adhering to that, he's disregarding her preferences. Relationships often require mutual respect and compromise. The author's approach might be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his own needs over her expressed desire for equality, even though he's making efforts like taking her to sushi. \n\nAdditionally, the author's justification about eating more might not hold in a relationship where mutual respect and shared experiences are valued. The wife's insistence on equality could be about fairness and partnership rather than just the physical amount consumed. The author's plan to take advantage of her eating less could be seen as manipulative, using her initial choice to gain more for himself without her consent.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have valid reasons for wanting more pizza, the core issue is about respecting his wife's wishes and maintaining equality in their relationship. The author's actions disregard her stated preferences and could be seen as inconsiderate, making him the asshole in this scenario.\n"
