My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife wants 50-50. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon. He mentions that he orders pizza four times a year, and in return, he takes her to sushi four times. He's trying to balance their preferences. The wife's argument is about equality\u2014each gets half. The author thinks it's fairer to split based on their sizes and eating habits.\n\nBut here's the thing: they're both adults in a relationship. The wife agreed to the pizza order because she knew he wanted it. She might feel that since it's his treat, he should get more, but she's insisting on equal shares. However, the author is planning to take more than half by letting her eat until she's full, then taking the rest. That seems sneaky. He's not just splitting 60-40 upfront but manipulating the process to get more for himself. That could be seen as underhanded.\n\nAlso, the wife might value fairness in the relationship, and the author is dismissing her view of equality. The fact that he takes her to sushi four times a year shows he's trying to balance her preferences, so maybe she feels the pizza should be split fairly as well. His plan to take her \"self-declared half\" after she eats is a bit of a trick. Even if he believes he's entitled to more, the method he uses to take it without her knowing could be considered deceitful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is based on physical differences and the fact that he's the one who treats her to sushi. But the wife might see the pizza as a shared treat that he's responsible for, so equal split is fair. The key here is mutual respect. If the wife is uncomfortable with 50-50, maybe they should compromise, but the author isn't really offering that. Instead, he's planning to take more without addressing her feelings. That lack of communication and respect for her boundaries might make him the asshole here. So, the answer could be A.\n"
