My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting 60% of the pizza instead of 50-50. They ordered a pizza using a coupon their wife allowed, but she wants half. He argues that since he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, where he eats cheap kid's plates while she gets the expensive ones. So he's trying to balance things out.\n\nHmm, the core issue is about fairness in sharing. The wife wants equality (50-50), while the husband thinks it should be proportional to their needs (60-40). There's a cultural aspect too, since pizza is a taste from his home country. He's making an effort to accommodate her by bringing sushi, but she's not reciprocating with pizza.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is that he's planning to take more than half even if she doesn't finish hers. So he's taking advantage of her eating habits. That could be seen as manipulative. Also, the sushi comparison might not be fair because sushi is a different context\u2014maybe the wife's expense is a treat she enjoys, while pizza is something he's allowed once in a while. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing her to eat natto; it's a consequence of her not finishing her share. But if he's intentionally eating her leftover portion, is that fair? His plan sounds like he's expecting her to eat less than half, which might be the case, and then he takes the rest. That could be seen as taking an unfair advantage, even if he thinks it's justified.\n\nThe wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. Maybe she values equal sharing regardless of physical differences. His approach could be perceived as undermining her autonomy in the agreement they made (half each). \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the agreement was half each, he's breaking that. But if the agreement was just permission to buy it with a coupon, maybe the division isn't set. However, he mentioned she expects half, so he agreed to that but is planning to take more. That's where the potential issue is. \n\nHe might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her expectations, even if he thinks his reasoning is fair. Relationships often require compromise, even if one side thinks their logic is better. His plan to take more than half without her consent could be seen as selfish. So, maybe answer A.\n"
