My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants a larger portion because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on equal halves. The author plans to let her eat her half first and then take the remaining, even if that means she can't have leftovers for breakfast. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase because of a coupon, but she's concerned about health and cost. The author mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, where he's mindful of her preferences. That shows he's making an effort to accommodate her taste, so maybe he's trying to be fair in that aspect.\n\nThe main issue is the division of the pizza. The wife wants equal halves because of equality in the relationship. The author argues that his body size and appetite justify a 60-40 split. But is that a valid reason? Well, in relationships, compromises are often necessary. The wife's insistence on equality might be her way of feeling that things are balanced, especially if she's concerned about health and cost. The author, on the other hand, feels his physical needs should be considered.\n\nBut the author's plan to take the leftovers after she's done eating her half seems a bit manipulative. He's essentially planning to let her eat until she's full, but then take the rest. That could come off as unfair because he's not being transparent about his own consumption. Even if he ends up eating more, he's using her half's leftovers, which might not be fair if she had a strict limit in mind. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction could stem from feeling that her preferences are being ignored. The author's approach to sushi shows he's aware of her likes, but in the pizza case, he's prioritizing his own needs. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe the author needs to find a middle ground, like dividing the pizza into two parts but allowing for some flexibility if one is hungrier. \n\nMoreover, the author's plan to not feel bad about it might hurt the wife's feelings. Relationships require mutual respect, and if the wife feels her boundaries aren't being respected, that could lead to resentment. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing her concerns directly and instead using a strategy that could be seen as taking advantage.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the author has valid reasons for wanting more, the way he's handling the situation might be unfair and disrespectful. The wife's insistence on equality could be about feeling valued in the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
