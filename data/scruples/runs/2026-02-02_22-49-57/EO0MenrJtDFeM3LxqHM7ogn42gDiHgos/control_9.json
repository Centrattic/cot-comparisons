My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The scenario is that the person ordered a pizza with a coupon, got permission from his wife, but they're arguing over how to split it. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he eats cheaper, so he feels like he's already giving her something she likes.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife wants equal halves, while the author thinks his physical size and appetite justify a bigger share. But the author is also planning to take more than half by letting her eat her declared half first and then taking the rest. That seems a bit sneaky. \n\nThe wife's argument is about equality as a couple, which is a common value. The author's reasoning is based on personal needs, but maybe he's not considering that they're sharing the meal together. Even if he eats more, splitting equally could be about fairness in the relationship rather than just physical needs. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take more without discussing it might not be respectful. He's acting on his own decision rather than finding a compromise. The wife might feel her wishes are being disregarded even though she agreed to the pizza. \n\nSo, maybe the author is wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split they had before. Even if he thinks his reasoning is fair, going behind her back could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that he's using the \"let her eat first\" plan might come off as manipulative. \n\nBut some might argue that he's just taking what he's entitled to based on his needs. However, relationships often require compromise, and if the wife is set on equal halves, he should honor that to maintain harmony. The author's approach could be seen as selfish, not considering her feelings even if he's right about his share. \n\nSo, probably the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting the mutual agreement and is being manipulative about the split.\n"
