My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about splitting a pizza equally versus splitting it based on size or appetite. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more. His wife insists on 50-50, saying they should be equal. He mentions that he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places as well, where he eats cheaper options while she can have the expensive ones. He plans to take more than half of the pizza after she eats her fill.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about fairness in sharing. The wife's argument is based on equality, meaning each gets half regardless of appetite or body size. The author's argument is based on practicality\u2014since he eats more, he should get a larger portion. \n\nBut there's also the context of their other dining habits. The author says he takes her to sushi four times a year and lets her have more expensive dishes. Maybe he's compensating elsewhere? That could be his way of balancing things out. However, the pizza is a personal preference for him, and he's allowed it because of the coupon. \n\nNow, considering fairness, is it wrong to adjust the split based on individual needs? In some cultures, splitting equally is the norm, but others might adjust based on circumstances. The author isn't being greedy; he's just taking into account their different appetites. However, the wife might feel that equal sharing is a principle, so the author's plan to take more after she eats might feel like he's undermining her autonomy or their agreement. \n\nAlso, the author's method of letting her eat her portion first and then taking the rest could be seen as manipulative, even if unintentionally. She agreed to half, but he's not honoring that agreement. But maybe she's being rigid by not considering his larger appetite. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication problems might be at play here. They haven't resolved this before, and he's planning to go against her wishes. That could lead to resentment. Even if he thinks he's being fair, not following through on her terms might be the issue. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's going against her stated agreement, even if he thinks it's fair, then yes, he's not respecting her terms. But if the agreement was just a suggestion and he's adjusting based on reality, maybe not. The key is whether the agreement was a compromise or an absolute rule. Since she's \"repeatedly demanded\" it, he's choosing to ignore it, which could be seen as the problem. \n\nI think the answer is A, meaning he is in the wrong because he's not following through on the agreed split, even if he has a reason. Relationships often require compromise, and if she's willing to let him have pizza occasionally but expects a fair share, then he should honor that unless they can negotiate a different arrangement. His plan to take more after she eats might come across as unfair, even if he's trying to be practical.\n"
