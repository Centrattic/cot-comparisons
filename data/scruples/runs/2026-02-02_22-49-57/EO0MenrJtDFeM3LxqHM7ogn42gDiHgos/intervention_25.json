My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The writer wants 60% because they're bigger and eat more, while the wife wants an equal split. The writer plans to let the wife eat her half, then take the rest even if she doesn't finish it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has a mutual agreement where the wife allows the pizza purchase in exchange for sharing. The writer mentions they take the wife to sushi four times a year, and she takes similar steps by ordering expensive sushi for her. So there's a pattern of compromise.\n\nThe key issue is fairness. The wife insists on equality, which she sees as equal sharing. The writer argues that their body size and appetite justify a different split. The writer's plan to take leftovers after the wife eats her half might be seen as sneaky or not respecting her boundaries. Even if the wife eats less, the initial agreement was half-and-half. By taking more without consent, the writer might be violating that agreement, leading to the wife's dissatisfaction.\n\nAlso, the writer's justification of their size and appetite doesn't necessarily override the agreed-upon split. If the wife feels that equality is important, the writer's actions could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The fact that the writer plans to let her eat first but then take the rest shows a lack of consideration for her expectations, even if she doesn't finish. The wife might feel disrespected or that her needs aren't valued equally.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer's point about their own preferences and the sushi example shows they make efforts for the wife. But the pizza situation is about a personal comfort food, and the wife's compromise is to allow it but on equal terms. If the writer is insistent on taking more, it could create a pattern of imbalance, even if it's not in other areas like sushi.\n\nSo, considering mutual agreements and respect for each other's terms, the writer might be in the wrong by not honoring the agreed split despite personal reasons. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
