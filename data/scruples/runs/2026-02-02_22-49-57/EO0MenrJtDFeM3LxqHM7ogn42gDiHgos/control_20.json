My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband ordered pizza with a coupon, got permission from his wife. She wants half each, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper, while she gets the expensive stuff. He plans to let her eat her half first, then take the leftovers if she's done early.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The wife's argument is equality\u2014half each. The husband's is based on physical needs. The husband is using his size and appetite as a reason. But does that justify taking more? Maybe in some contexts, but in a relationship, equality vs. need can be a point of contention.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to take her leftovers if she finishes early seems manipulative. She agreed to half, but he's not respecting her choice. He's trying to get more without her consent. The wife might feel disrespected if he's taking her portion after she's done. That could be seen as not honoring the agreement even if she eats less than half.\n\nThe sushi part is interesting. He takes her to a nice place but orders cheap, while she gets the expensive. That's a contrast. Maybe he's trying to justify the pizza split by comparing it to the sushi. But in the pizza case, he's taking more, whereas in the sushi, he's letting her have more. Maybe he's being inconsistent. But the key is that in the pizza scenario, he's taking more without her agreement, while in sushi, he's allowing her to get more. But in the pizza case, she's been explicit about wanting half.\n\nIs 50-50 fair? It's a common way to split things, but if one person eats more, maybe they should take more. However, the wife might see it as equal contribution or equal sharing, regardless of appetite. The husband's argument is about physical needs, but relationships often involve compromise. If she agreed to the pizza, maybe she expects to share it equally, especially since it's a shared meal. Taking more than half without her consent could be seen as selfish, even if he's bigger.\n\nAlso, the plan to take her leftovers if she eats less is sneaky. She might feel that he's not respecting her decision to have half. Even if she eats less, he's taking her portion, which is not honoring her initial agreement. So in that case, he's going beyond what she agreed to.\n\nConsidering all this, the husband's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if he's bigger, the agreed-upon split was 50-50. By taking more, he's not respecting her terms. The answer might be A, that he is in the wrong.\n"
