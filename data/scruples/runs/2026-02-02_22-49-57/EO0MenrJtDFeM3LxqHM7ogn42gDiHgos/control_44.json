My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about pizza sharing between a husband and wife. The husband wants to split the pizza 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50 because of equality. The husband plans to take more than half by letting her eat until she's full first, then take the rest of her half.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife allowed him to buy the pizza with a coupon, so she's okay with it. But she wants half. The husband argues based on size and appetite. The wife wants equality. The husband is also mentioned to take her to sushi often, but he eats cheap options while she gets expensive ones. That's interesting. Maybe there's a pattern here of him giving her things but expecting something in return?\n\nThe husband's plan is to let her eat her fill first, which he knows will be less than half, then take the rest. This seems underhanded. He's not splitting it 60-40 upfront but using a strategy to get more. The wife might end up with leftovers or have to eat natto instead. The husband is okay with that.\n\nThe main question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The wife's stance is about equality, while the husband's is about physical needs. But fairness can be subjective. However, the husband's method of taking more by letting her eat first could be seen as manipulative. Also, the fact that he plans to make her eat natto the next day if she doesn't eat all her half might be harsh. \n\nLooking at the couple's dynamic, the husband has a history of this issue, bringing it up before. The wife insists on equality, so maybe she feels it's important for them to share equally. The husband's approach might be seen as not respecting her agreement to the 50-50 split. Even if he's bigger, she might expect mutual respect for each other's preferences. The husband's plan to take more could be considered unfair because he's circumventing the agreed-upon split. \n\nAnother angle: the husband was allowed to buy the pizza, so he's within his rights to do so. But splitting it 50-50 was a condition. If he's against that, maybe he should have negotiated upfront. However, he went ahead knowing she expected half. His plan to take more after he knows she'll eat less than half might be seen as deceitful. \n\nAdditionally, the husband mentions taking her to sushi where he eats cheap and she gets expensive. That might balance out in their relationship, but in the pizza situation, he's taking a different approach. Maybe the wife feels that the pizza should be split equally as a compromise, given their differing tastes in food. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's plan is to take more than half, which could be seen as not respecting her agreement, even if he has his reasons. The key is whether the method he's using is fair. Since he's not splitting it as agreed but using a strategy to take more, that's where the issue lies. The answer might be that he is in the wrong because he's not honoring the agreed split and is manipulating the situation to get more for himself.\n"
