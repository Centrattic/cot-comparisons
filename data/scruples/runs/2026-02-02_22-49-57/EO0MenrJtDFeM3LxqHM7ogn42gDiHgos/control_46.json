My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple arguing over how to split a pizza they're going to order. The husband wants a 60-40 split in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on a 50-50 split. The husband plans to let her eat her half, take the rest, and not feel guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife allowed him to order the pizza using a coupon, so she's already agreed to the purchase. The husband's reasoning is based on his physical size and eating habits, while the wife's stance is about equality. The husband also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he orders cheaper for himself and lets her have the more expensive dishes. That could imply a balance in their spending habits. \n\nThe question is whether expecting a 60-40 split is wrong. The wife's argument is about equality, but maybe the husband is just being practical. However, the husband's plan to take the remaining pizza after she eats her half might be seen as unfair. If he takes more than she does, even if she doesn't finish her half, it could come off as greedy. The wife might feel that the initial agreement was 50-50, so deviating from that could be a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach to the sushi dinners shows he's considerate of her preferences, so why isn't the pizza splitting similar? Maybe he's being inconsistent. The wife might see the pizza as a shared meal, and taking more could be seen as not respecting her wishes, especially since she agreed to the purchase under the condition of splitting equally. The husband's plan to let her eat first but then take the rest undermines her choice. \n\nAnother angle is that the wife's insistence on equality might be about fair sharing in the relationship, while the husband's argument is about physical needs. But relationships often require compromise beyond just physical aspects. The husband's actions might be seen as not valuing her feelings of fairness, leading to the \"asshole\" label. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is planning to take more without considering her perspective. The answer would be A, he is the asshole.\n"
