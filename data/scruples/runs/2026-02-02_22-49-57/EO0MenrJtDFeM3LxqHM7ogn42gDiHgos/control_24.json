My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split based on size and eating habits, while his wife insists on half each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife agreed to let him order the pizza because he found a coupon. She's okay with him getting it, even though she's against it generally. The author argues that he's bigger and eats more, so 60% is fair. The wife, on the other hand, wants equality, hence 50-50.\n\nThe author also mentions that he's making an effort by taking her to a nice sushi place four times a year, letting her choose expensive dishes while he sticks to cheaper options. He's trying to accommodate her preferences there, which shows some effort in balancing their preferences. However, she's still holding out for equal pizza portions.\n\nThe key here is whether fairness is determined by equality or by individual needs. The author believes in splitting based on their physical needs, while the wife sees equality in the split as fair. The wife's stance is that they should be equal partners, so each gets half. The author's plan is to take the remaining portions after she's eaten her fill, which might come off as manipulative or not respecting her agreement.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, fairness can be subjective. If the wife is uncomfortable with the 60-40 split and has communicated that, the author's plan to take advantage of her eating habits to get more pizza might not be the best approach. It could strain trust and show a lack of compromise. The author is using the fact that she eats less to take more, which might not be fair in a partnership where mutual respect is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to do something he enjoys, which is understandable, and he's making an effort to please her in other ways. The problem arises when the compromise isn't met, and he's planning to outsmart her, which might be seen as selfish.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's approach, while based on his own reasoning, might be seen as disregarding his wife's feelings and the agreed-upon terms. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her equal share and for planning to take advantage of her preferences.\n"
