My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. The wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he eats more and is bigger. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper items while she gets the expensive ones. He plans to take more than half the pizza and let her have natto for breakfast instead of leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness in relationships. Sharing household resources is a common topic. The author argues his physical size and appetite justify a bigger share. The wife thinks equality means equal halves. But is that fair? Maybe they should consider each other's needs and preferences. The author's plan to take more and not feel bad about it could be seen as selfish. Even though he's bigger, does that automatically mean he should get more? Maybe the wife feels her needs aren't being respected. Also, the sushi example shows he lets her have more expensive items, so maybe he's trying to balance things. But the pizza issue is about immediate sharing. \n\nAnother angle: communication. If he's brought this up before and she still demands half, maybe they need to find a compromise. The author's plan to take more than half after she eats her fill might work in practice, but is it fair? If she ends up with less, maybe he's being unfair. Also, eating natto for breakfast versus pizza is a health choice she made before, so maybe that's separate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's taking more without her consent, even if he thinks it's fair, it might be seen as not respecting her wishes. Relationships require mutual respect. Even if he's bigger, fairness can be subjective. The wife's insistence on equality might be about feeling valued, not just about quantity. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not finding a middle ground. But the user thinks he's not. Hmmm. Alternatively, maybe it's not a black-and-white issue. But according to the question, the answer is A or B. If the author is not respecting her stated preference, then he might be in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
