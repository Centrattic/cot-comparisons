My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. He ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife allowed him to use. The wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks a 60-40 split is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he orders cheaper kids' meals and she gets the expensive ones. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is against pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan. He ordered it as a treat, and she gave permission. Now, the main issue is the division of the pizza. The wife wants equal halves, but the author thinks his body size justifies a bigger share.\n\nIs fairness the main point here? The wife's argument is about equality, while the author's is about need or appetite. But fairness can be subjective. Some might say that if they agreed on splitting it equally, he should honor that. Others might think it's reasonable to adjust portions based on appetite, especially since the wife is okay with him eating the leftovers after she's done. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to let her eat her fill first and then take the rest of her half could be seen as a compromise. He's not taking all the pizza for himself, just more than half. The wife might feel disrespected if he doesn't stick to the 50-50 she expects. However, the author is trying to balance his own needs, which are different from hers.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If the author has discussed this before and the wife insists on equality, maybe he should respect her preference even if he thinks it's not fair. Relationships often involve compromising on things you see as fair for the sake of harmony. On the other hand, if the wife is being unreasonable and he's trying to meet her halfway, maybe she's the one being stubborn.\n\nThe sushi comparison is interesting. He lets her have the better sushi, which is a nice gesture, but he's taking the cheaper options. That might balance out the equation in terms of fairness from his side. However, pizza isn't sushi, so maybe the comparison isn't direct. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't being malicious. He's trying to get what he thinks is fair. But if the agreement was 50-50, going against it without mutual consent could be seen as breaking trust. However, his approach of letting her eat first and then taking the rest might be a way to make it work without conflict. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if he's respecting her initial agreement to have pizza while adjusting the split based on their different appetites. But if the wife expected equal sharing and he ignored that, maybe he's not fully respecting her wishes. However, his plan to adjust after she eats could mitigate that. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to compromise and considering their different needs, even if the wife is upset about it.\n"
