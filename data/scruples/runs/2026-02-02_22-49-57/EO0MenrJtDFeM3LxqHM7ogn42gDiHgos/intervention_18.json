My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. They argue they should get 60% because they're bigger and eat more. The wife expects a 50-50 split because they're supposed to be equals. The author plans to take the remaining of her half after she's done eating, even if she's not full.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife is trying to enforce equality, which is a valid approach. The author is suggesting splitting based on physical size and eating habits. But equality doesn't always mean 50-50; it's about fairness. However, the author's plan might come off as manipulative or not respecting the wife's wishes. They agreed on half each, but he's going to take more anyway. That could be seen as dishonest because he didn't address the underlying issue but instead plans to take advantage of the situation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, which shows he's making an effort. But maybe the wife feels the pizza is a treat she doesn't enjoy, so she's not getting as much from it. The author's argument is about physical needs, but maybe the wife values the equality in sharing, even if she doesn't eat as much. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if they made a mutual agreement (half each) but he's going to break it, that's not fair. Even if he thinks his way is fair, he's not honoring the agreed-upon split, which could be seen as disrespectful. The wife's insistence on equality might be her way of feeling included or respecting the food she doesn't like. The author's plan to take more after she eats might lead to resentment. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the mutual agreement and is planning to act dishonestly instead of finding a compromise. The correct answer would be A.\n"
