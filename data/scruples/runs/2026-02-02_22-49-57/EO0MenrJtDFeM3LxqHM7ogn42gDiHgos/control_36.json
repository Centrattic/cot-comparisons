My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife.\n\nFirst, the husband wants to order a pizza he's allowed to buy with a coupon. He thinks he should get 60% because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on splitting it 50-50 because they're equals. The husband plans to let her eat her half first and then take the rest if he's still hungry.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife's argument is based on equality, which is a common value in relationships. The husband's reasoning is based on physical needs. But maybe there's an assumption here that the wife will eat less than half, which might not be fair either. \n\nThe husband mentions that they both do things for each other\u2014like sushi for her, pizza for him. But when it comes to the pizza, he wants a bigger share. Is it fair to assume that because he's bigger, he should get more? Or should it be about what each person actually wants? \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done might make the wife feel disrespected. If she's agreed to half, maybe he should respect that instead of trying to get around it. \n\nAnother angle: if they agreed she gets half, but he plans to take more, that's not honoring the agreement. Even if he thinks she'll leave some, manipulating the situation might be seen as selfish. \n\nThe wife's insistence on equality could be about fairness in sharing, not just physical needs. Maybe the husband isn't considering that she might also want to enjoy the pizza equally, even if she eats less. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he agreed to half but then takes more, that's not good. Also, the way he's planning to do it seems a bit sneaky. The wife's point about equality is valid, especially in a relationship where mutual respect is important. The husband's argument might be based on a flawed assumption that size determines food share. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed split and is acting selfishly despite knowing her stance.\n"
