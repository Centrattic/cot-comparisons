My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about dividing a pizza between him and his wife. He ordered a large pizza using a coupon with her permission. She wants half, but he thinks 60/40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places, but he doesn't like the same things she does. His plan is to let her eat her fill first, which he expects would be less than half, and then take the rest. The question is whether he's being an asshole by not splitting it equally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife has given him permission to order pizza because he loves it, and she's aware of his preferences. However, she's insisting on an equal split. He feels that because of their different appetites, a 60/40 split is fair. The key points here are consent, fairness, and mutual respect.\n\nHe ordered the pizza with her approval, so she's not against it. The issue is the division. He's trying to split it based on their physical needs. But in relationships, fairness can sometimes be more about mutual respect than strict physical metrics. The wife might feel that equality in sharing is important, even if their appetites differ. The author's plan to let her eat her share first and then take the rest might come off as manipulative or dismissive of her wishes. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's not splitting it equally despite her clear request could be seen as disregarding her opinion. Even if he doesn't agree, the way he's handling it\u2014by not directly confronting the issue and instead taking advantage of her eating habits\u2014might be seen as passive-aggressive. The question is whether his actions are disrespectful. \n\nHe does mention that he's trying to balance things out by taking her to sushi, but she's not getting the same value from his choices as he does from hers. However, the pizza issue is about splitting the same food, which she's allowed him to buy. The argument is about equality versus individual needs. \n\nIn many relationships, respecting each other's preferences and agreements is crucial. If the wife expects an equal split, and he's not honoring that, even if he believes otherwise, it's a matter of perspective. The author's approach might be seen as undermining her wishes for the sake of his own comfort. So, while he might think he's being reasonable based on their sizes, the act of not dividing it as agreed could be considered inconsiderate.\n"
