My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The scenario involves a husband and wife where the wife has given permission for him to order pizza using a coupon. However, she expects an equal split, half for each, but the husband believes a 60-40 split is fair based on their sizes and eating habits. He plans to let her eat her fill first, then take the rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife allowed him to buy the pizza, which is a compromise because she normally disapproves. The husband's reasoning is based on his larger size and higher appetite. He's also mentioned balancing things by taking her to sushi, where he might order cheaper items while she has the more expensive ones. This could indicate an effort to balance their preferences even in other contexts.\n\nThe husband's plan is a bit tricky. He allows her to eat her declared half first, then takes the remaining. This might be seen as manipulating the situation to get more than half without her realizing. However, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in sharing, not just about quantity. \n\nCultural factors might play a role here. In some cultures, sharing equally is a sign of equality in a relationship, while in others, practicality (like appetite) might take precedence. The husband is in Japan, where the cost is a factor, so the expense might influence their negotiation. The wife's concern about health and cost could mean she's trying to limit his pizza consumption, hence the equal split to reduce waste or expense.\n\nThe husband's approach of letting her eat first and then taking the rest might be a way to avoid direct confrontation, but it could be seen as not being transparent. If he's planning to take more than half after she's done, maybe she's unaware of this intention, which could lead to her feeling taken advantage of later.\n\nThe main question is whether expecting 60-40 is fair. The husband's argument is based on physical needs, while the wife's is about equality. In relationships, compromise is key. If she's willing to let him have pizza, perhaps the equal split is part of that compromise. If he's taking more, even if he justifies it by appetite, it might not align with her terms. \n\nAlso, the husband's mention of taking her to sushi four times a year where he pays for cheaper items shows he's trying to balance things in her favor. But the pizza situation is different because she's the one who allows the purchase. The equal split might be her way of managing their budget and health together, and him taking more could undermine that.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife agreed to the purchase but wants equal portions, the husband's plan to take advantage of that by letting her eat first might not be honest. Even if he believes she'll stop at less than half, manipulating the portions after the fact could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the husband's approach might be seen as not respecting the agreed terms of equal sharing, even if he has his reasoning. Relationships often require meeting each other's needs without undermining the compromises made. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not adhering to the agreed split despite his reasoning.\n"
