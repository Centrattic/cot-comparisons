My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the scenario is about pizza sharing between a husband and wife. The author ordered a pizza, got permission from his wife, but they're disagreeing on how to split it. He thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more, while she wants it split 50-50 because of equality.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is based on their body size and eating habits. He's taller and bigger, so he eats more. That seems practical. But the wife's argument is about equality in the relationship. She wants equal shares, maybe seeing it as a fair division regardless of consumption needs.\n\nThe author mentions that he compromises in other areas, like taking her to sushi places where she can order more expensive items. That shows he's trying to accommodate her preferences. However, he's not willing to split the pizza equally because of his own needs. The plan he has is to let her eat her \"half\" first, then take the rest if he's still hungry. This might leave her with natto for breakfast instead of leftovers, which he doesn't feel bad about.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, the key here is whether splitting based on physical needs is fair. In relationships, fairness can be subjective. Some might argue that equal sharing promotes equality, while others see it as practical to adjust based on individual needs. The author's approach could be seen as selfish if he takes more without considering her feelings. She might feel her needs aren't respected, even if he's compromising elsewhere. However, the author believes he's justified because of his size. \n\nThe question is whether the expectation of equal sharing is unreasonable. The wife's stance on equality is a valid perspective. The author's plan to take more after she's eaten her half could be seen as manipulative, as he's allowing her to eat first but then taking the rest. That might be where the problem lies. The wife's demand for half is about fairness in the relationship, while his is practical. It's a classic fairness vs. practicality debate. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, sometimes equal sharing is expected in relationships, but if one partner has a higher appetite, adjusting the split is also common. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. If the author had discussed his needs and found a middle ground, it might be better. But his current plan could be seen as disregarding her feelings. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? It depends. If he's willing to listen and find a compromise, maybe not. But his current approach might be seen as prioritizing his own needs over her wishes, which could make him the asshole. The fact that he's planning to take more after she eats her half might be the issue. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her equal sharing request and is using a manipulative tactic to take more, even if he has a practical reason.\n"
