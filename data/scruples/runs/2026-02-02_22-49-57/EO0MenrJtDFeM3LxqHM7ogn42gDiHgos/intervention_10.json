My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife.\n\nFirst, the wife gave permission to order pizza because of the coupon. The author wants to take more than half because they eat more, being bigger. The wife insists on equal halves, citing equality. The author plans to let her eat her fill first, which they think will be less than half, and then take the rest.\n\nHmm, from a fairness perspective, the author argues that their body size and appetite justify a larger share. But the wife is also emphasizing equality. Maybe the problem is about respecting her wishes even if they think it's unfair. The author's plan to outsmart her by letting her eat first might be seen as manipulative. Even if the author's intention is to get more pizza, the method could be problematic. The wife might feel disrespected if her request isn't honored, even if she ends up not eating her full half. So, maybe the author is wrong because they're not respecting her terms, even if they think it's unfair. The key here is mutual respect in a relationship. Insisting on a different ratio without compromise could be the issue.\n"
