My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about how they split a pizza with their wife.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband ordered pizza because he likes it, got a coupon with his wife's permission. He wants to have 60% of the pizza, while she insists on 50-50. He argues that he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. He mentions that they each do things for each other, like taking her to sushi and vice versa, but she still wants half the pizza. His plan is to let her eat her fill (which he expects will be less than half) and then eat the rest of her half, leaving her with natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase, so she's not against it. The argument is about splitting it. The husband feels his larger size and higher appetite justify a bigger share. But the wife wants equality. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, maybe it's about personal preferences and agreements. The husband is trying to optimize for his own needs, but the wife's insistence on equal shares could be about equality in their relationship. However, he's also being strategic by letting her eat first, knowing she'll take less than half, and then taking the rest. That might come off as manipulative or not respecting her wishes. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's planning to make her eat natto instead of letting her have leftovers could be seen as taking advantage. Even if he believes his approach is fair, the action of eating her leftovers without her consent might be disrespectful. The wife might feel her agreed-upon share is being taken away, which could hurt her feelings or feel like a violation of the agreement they made. \n\nOn the other hand, he did mention that he does things for her, like the sushi, which shows consideration. But the pizza is his preference, and he's trying to balance that with her preferences. However, the key issue is whether 50-50 is fair. Since they are equals in the relationship, maybe she feels that equal sharing is important regardless of their physical differences. \n\nThe husband's strategy to outeat her plan might lead to her not getting what she agreed to, which could cause resentment. Even if he's technically right about her eating less than half, he's undermining her expectations. So, while his reasoning is based on practicality, it might not consider her emotional needs for equality and mutual respect. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is often about finding a middle ground. If he's willing to accept half, even if it's less than he prefers, it shows flexibility. But he's not doing that; instead, he's planning to take more, which could be seen as selfish. The answer might hinge on whether fairness is about equality or proportional needs. But in many relationships, equal division is a common practice to avoid conflict, even if one person eats more. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's agreed-upon share and is acting in a way that could be seen as taking advantage of her, even if his logic seems practical. His plan to eat her leftovers after she eats her fill might backfire and hurt her feelings, making him the asshole.\n"
