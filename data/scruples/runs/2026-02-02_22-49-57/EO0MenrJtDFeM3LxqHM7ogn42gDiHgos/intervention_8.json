My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple disagreeing about how to split a pizza they're ordering. The author ordered a large pizza using a coupon that the wife approved. The wife wants half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions other times he accommodates her preferences, like taking her to sushi. He plans to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers, even if she ends up with natto for breakfast.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are fairness and mutual respect. The wife gave permission for the pizza, so the author isn't going against her wishes there. He's trying to adjust the split based on their different appetites. But the wife values equality, hence the 50-50 split. The author, on the other hand, feels his body requires more food. \n\nBut does that justify taking more? Maybe not. Even if he eats more, dividing the pizza 50-50 could still be fair because maybe she has dietary restrictions or preferences. Also, the author mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheap plates while she gets expensive ones. That might be a point in his favor, showing he's trying to accommodate her. However, the pizza issue is a recurring problem. If he's only ordering pizza four times a year, maybe the 60-40 split is his way of balancing the sushi outings. \n\nBut then, the wife might feel that equality in the relationship means splitting things equally, regardless of appetite. The author's approach might come off as not respecting her equal share, which could be seen as selfish. However, the author is trying to justify it by his physical needs. The real question is whether respecting personal differences in appetite outweighs the principle of equality in the relationship. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the wife's request is reasonable. If she's okay with the sushi arrangement, why not the pizza? Maybe the author is being inconsistent. Alternatively, the wife might feel that pizza is a treat, so splitting it equally is fair, while sushi is a regular indulgence. \n\nThe author's plan to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers might lead to her not getting enough, which could be unfair. But he's also not forcing her to eat natto; she might choose that. However, the act of taking leftovers from her declared half could be seen as not respecting her decision. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether intentionally shortchanging her is wrong. The author isn't taking from her half directly, but he's allowing himself to take it after she's done eating. It's a bit of a passive-aggressive strategy. So maybe he is in the wrong because he's not honoring the agreed-upon 50-50 split she requested, even if he's adjusting based on her consumption. Alternatively, if the wife's rule is too rigid, the author's approach could be seen as reasonable. \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect. If the wife gave permission to order the pizza but still expects half, the author should honor that. Otherwise, they need to negotiate. The author's plan to \"let her eat her fill\" but then take the rest might not be fair because it's not a 60-40 split as he claims. If she eats less than half, he's taking more, which he's okay with. That could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon terms, even if he has his own reasoning. But maybe the wife's insistence on equality is also rigid. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the wife. Since he's going against her explicit request despite her giving permission for the pizza, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
