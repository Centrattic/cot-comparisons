My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves pizza division between them and their wife. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the husband wants to order pizza, which his wife isn't a big fan of because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan. He got a coupon and she agreed to the purchase. He orders a large pizza because he likes more, not just for value. He argues that since he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair, but she insists on 50-50. He's okay with letting her eat her half first, knowing she'll stop before it's all gone, so he can have the rest. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, where he orders cheaper for himself and lets her have the expensive stuff. She still wants half the pizza. He's planning to take the remaining from her portion after she's done, even if that means she can't have leftovers.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. The main ethical issue here is about fairness and mutual respect in the relationship. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase but expects an equal split. The husband is proposing a different split based on their body size, which he sees as fair. But does that make him in the wrong?\n\nIn relationships, equality often means considering each other's preferences and needs. The husband's reasoning is based on physical differences, but the wife might feel that equal sharing is important for balance. The husband's plan to take from her portion after she's done could be seen as undermining her agreement, even if he's not forcing her. It might come off as manipulative, especially if he's taking advantage of her initial decision to share equally.\n\nAlso, the husband's comparison to the sushi outings shows he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences there. However, in the pizza case, he's not offering the same flexibility. The wife's insistence on half the pizza might be about wanting to feel equally valued, not just about the amount of food. If the husband proceeds with his plan, it could lead to feelings of being disrespected, even if logically, he's not taking more than he wants. Relationships often require compromise beyond logical reasoning, especially when it comes to perceptions of fairness and respect.\n\nSo, while the husband has his reasons, his approach might not consider the wife's perspective adequately. The key is mutual respect and communication. By not addressing her insistence on equal division and instead planning to take from her portion, he might be disregarding her feelings. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A), as his actions could be seen as not respecting her wishes and creating an unfair dynamic, even if he's technically not taking more than he eats.\n"
