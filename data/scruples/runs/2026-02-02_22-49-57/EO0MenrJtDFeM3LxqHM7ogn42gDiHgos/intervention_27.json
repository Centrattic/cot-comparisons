My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the pizza situation is in the wrong. The author orders a pizza with a coupon, got permission from his wife, but they disagree on how to split it. He argues for 60-40 based on size and eating more, while she wants 50-50. He also mentions he takes her to sushi places and orders cheaper for himself.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband got permission to order pizza, so that's not an issue. The disagreement is about the split. He thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more, while she insists on equality. The husband's plan is to let her eat her share first and then take the rest, even if she doesn't finish. \n\nNow, considering fairness in relationships. It's about mutual respect and compromise. While physical size might influence how much someone eats, that doesn't necessarily justify a strict 60-40 split. Relationships often require equal consideration even if there are differences. The wife's argument is about equality, which is a common value in partnerships. The husband's approach might come off as dismissive of her feelings, especially if she feels her preferences are being overlooked. Also, the husband's plan to take the leftovers without feeling bad could be seen as undermining her autonomy. Even though he's trying to be considerate in other ways (like sushi), this specific issue might be about respect for each other's needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is being honest about his preferences and the practicalities of his body. He's not forcing her to eat something she doesn't like. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014by taking more without discussion\u2014might not be the healthiest approach for their relationship. Maybe a more open conversation or a middle ground (like alternating weeks or adjusting sizes) would be better. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, the concept of equality in relationships is strong. The wife's insistence on fairness is valid, and the husband's reasoning, while practical, might not account for emotional aspects. The husband's plan to not feel bad about taking leftovers could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it affects her next day's meal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong, but his approach might not be the best for their relationship. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's acting based on his reasoning without forcing her, the answer might lean towards 'No' (B). But there's a nuance here. The answer depends on whether the reader values equality over individual differences. If the husband's actions are respectful and he's not being selfish beyond his reasoning, then B is correct. If the act of taking more without considering her feelings is the issue, then A. But given the context, the husband isn't violating any explicit agreement and is acting in his own interest, so B.\n"
