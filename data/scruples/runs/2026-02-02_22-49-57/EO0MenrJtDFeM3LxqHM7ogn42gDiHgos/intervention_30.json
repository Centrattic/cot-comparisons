My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her half first and then take the rest if he's still hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context they provided. The author mentions that he orders pizza four times a year and takes her to sushi places four times a year, where he eats cheap kid's plates and she can have the expensive ones. That seems like he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences even though he doesn't like them. So maybe he's trying to balance things out in other areas.\n\nThe wife's argument is about equality\u2014she wants half the pizza because they're supposed to be equals. But the author argues that physical differences mean different needs. Is equality about equal shares regardless of personal needs, or is it about fairness based on individual requirements? This is a classic fairness vs. equality debate.\n\nThe author's plan is to let her eat her half first, which means he's allowing her to take her share, but then he'll take the leftover. However, he's doing this in a way that he doesn't feel bad about, even if she ends up with less and has to eat natto the next day. Is this respectful? Well, maybe not. Even though he's technically following the agreement she set (half for her), he's using her declared half to take more than she actually consumes. That seems a bit manipulative. \n\nBut then again, if she's the one who insisted on the 50-50 split, maybe the author is within his rights to take the remaining after she's full. The problem is that the author isn't just taking his 60% upfront; he's letting her eat her half and then taking what's left, which might be more than she ate. That could be seen as taking advantage of her stated share. \n\nAnother angle: the wife might feel that the 50-50 is about fairness in the relationship, not just physical needs. Maybe she values equal contribution or symbolic equality in their shared expenses. The author's approach could be undermining her sense of fairness, even if he's trying to be practical.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he's bigger and eats more. That's a practical consideration. However, in relationships, things aren't always just about practicality. Emotional considerations also matter. If the wife feels her demand for equality is being ignored, it could lead to resentment. The author's plan to take the leftovers after she eats her half might be a way to assert his point, but it's a bit sneaky. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the agreement was 50-50, then he's not directly breaking that agreement by letting her eat first. But his intention is to take more, which could be seen as manipulative. The key here is whether expecting a different split based on personal circumstances is fair. The author's actions might not be outright wrong, but they could be seen as disrespectful to her preferences. Since the wife set the 50-50 rule, and he's going along with it but in a way that takes more, maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified because he's being practical. But relationships often require compromise. The fact that he's trying to balance with sushi outings might indicate he's trying to be fair elsewhere. However, the pizza issue is a recurring problem. The way he's handling it now might not be the best approach, but whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on the perspective. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are respecting the agreed-upon terms. If the agreement is 50-50, and he's taking more after she's done, maybe that's technically not following the agreement. But if the agreement is just that she gets half, and he can take the rest if needed, then he's not wrong. But the way he's doing it could be seen as exploiting her stated share. \n\nGiven that the question is whether he's the asshole, the answer might depend on social norms around fairness. In many relationships, equal sharing is expected regardless of physical needs, so the author's insistence on 60-40 might be seen as unfair. But if the wife is okay with it, then maybe not. However, the author isn't getting her consent for the 60-40; he's just going against her 50-50 demand. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reasoning is practical, the way he's handling the situation might be inconsiderate of his wife's perspective on equality. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms even though he's trying to balance it out elsewhere.\n"
