My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves pizza sharing with the wife.\n\nFirst, the husband wants to order a large pizza because he likes it and found a coupon. The wife allows it but expects half. He argues that he eats more, so 60-40 is fair. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi, but he eats cheaper options while she gets expensive ones. \n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife's stance is equality, half each. The husband thinks body size and appetite matter. But the wife's health concerns and the expense in Japan are factors too. \n\nThe husband plans to let her eat her half first and then take what's left. But that might mean she ends up with less, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if he's not forcing her, by taking the remaining, he's not respecting her initial agreement. \n\nAlso, the comparison to sushi: he's allowing her to have better sushi, but maybe there's an imbalance. However, pizza is his treat. The wife's health concerns might make her not want to eat as much, so expecting half might not be fair if she can't or won't eat it. \n\nBut the issue is about mutual agreement. The wife gave permission under the condition of half each. The husband isn't honoring that. Even if he thinks he eats more, the agreement was half. By taking more, he's breaking the terms she set. \n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't respect the agreed-upon split. The answer should be A.\n"
