My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for expecting more than half the pizza when he ordered it with a coupon his wife approved. The key points are:\n\n1. The wife doesn't like pizza due to health and cost, but allowed him to order with a coupon.\n2. The author wants 60/40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while she insists on 50/50 for equality.\n3. He reciprocates by taking her to sushi, where he eats cheaper options and she gets expensive ones.\n4. His plan is to let her eat her half but keep the rest, even if she doesn't finish it, leading her to eat natto for breakfast.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is based on his physical size and eating habits. But fairness is subjective. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. Even if he eats more, splitting equally might be seen as fair because they both contributed to the shared meal. The author's plan to take the remaining part after she's done is sneaky and might be seen as unfair, even if he thinks she won't eat all hers. Also, the fact that he's using her permission (given due to the coupon) to justify taking more could be a gray area. The sushi part shows he's trying to reciprocate, but that doesn't necessarily balance the pizza issue. The key here is whether respecting her wishes is more important than his own needs. The author's approach might be seen as undermining her compromise, making him the asshole. Answer A.\n"
