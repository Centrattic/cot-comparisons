My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation involves the author and his wife. He ordered a pizza using a coupon she allowed, but she insists on splitting it 50-50. He argues he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. He also mentions balancing it out by taking her to sushi places.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he's taller, eats more, so he wants a larger share. The wife wants equality. The key here is whether fairness is tied to equal shares or needs. The author's plan to let her eat her half and then take the rest seems sneaky. Maybe he's not respecting her agreement? But she agreed to the coupon, not the split. \n\nHe mentions he's doing something similar with sushi, ordering cheaper but letting her have the expensive stuff. That seems fair. But with pizza, he wants more. The wife might feel her share is being taken away despite agreeing to eat pizza. The author's plan to take the remaining after she's done could be seen as underhanded. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's about mutual respect. If she agreed to the coupon, maybe the split wasn't discussed. He's trying to maximize his own benefit, but maybe he should have negotiated the split beforehand. However, his reasoning about body size and eating habits could be valid. Still, the method of taking the rest after she's done might be where he's wrong. So, maybe answer A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not honoring her agreed-upon share, even if he thinks he's entitled to more. The way he's planning to take the remaining could be seen as unfair.\n"
