My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the pizza scenario is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The person is sharing their situation where they ordered a pizza with a coupon, got permission from their wife, but she wants half, while they think 60-40 is fair. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband ordered a pizza, which his wife allowed because he used a coupon. He ordered a large pizza because he likes a lot of it. The wife wants half, and he believes 60-40 is fair due to physical differences. He mentions that he takes her to sushi places four times a year, but he orders cheap, while she gets the expensive ones. He plans to let her eat her fill first, which would leave some for him, and if she's still left with leftover, she'll have to eat natto instead.\n\nNow, considering fairness and equality. The wife argues for equal halves because they're supposed to be equals. The husband thinks body size and appetite justify a different split. But does that matter? If they agreed on sharing the pizza and he got permission, maybe the agreement was 50-50. However, he ordered it without specifying the split. The wife might feel entitled to half because they're equals, but the husband's reasoning is that he eats more. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to take her declared half after she's done eating seems a bit sneaky. He's not directly confronting the issue but letting her eat until she's full, then taking the rest. This might make her feel cheated, even if he's technically not taking more than he's supposed to. The key here is whether the agreement was verbal or written. Since she gave permission, maybe she expected an equal split. \n\nIn terms of fairness, some might argue that the initial agreement was 50-50, so he's violating that by planning to take more. Others might say that since he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. However, the wife might not see it that way. The husband's approach of letting her eat first and then taking the remainder is a bit manipulative. \n\nThe husband's actions could be seen as undermining the mutual agreement. Even if he's physically bigger, the wife's demand for equality is about fairness in their relationship. The fact that he's taking advantage of her by letting her eat until she's full and then taking the leftovers might be considered underhanded. \n\nAdditionally, the husband's reasoning about sushi versus pizza might not be directly relevant. Just because he spends more on sushi for her doesn't justify taking more pizza. The key issue is the initial agreement and mutual respect. \n\nSo, while the husband's reasoning is understandable, his actions might be seen as inconsiderate. The wife's insistence on equal halves is about equality, which is a valid perspective. The husband's plan to take more without her knowing could be seen as the asshole move. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the mutual agreement and is trying to manipulate the situation to take more than agreed.\n"
