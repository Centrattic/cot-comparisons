My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because they're bigger and eat more, while the wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to let the wife eat her fill first, which would leave less than half, and then take the rest. They also mention that they take her to sushi four times a year, but order cheap plates while encouraging her to get expensive ones.\n\nSo, first, the core issue is about fairness in their shared resources. The wife wants equality (half each), but the author argues for proportionality based on their different appetites. Is 50-50 inherently fair? Or is 60-40 more fair given their physical needs? The concept of fairness can be subjective here. Some might argue that in a relationship, sharing equally is fair regardless of individual needs, promoting equality. Others might say that fairness should consider each person's actual consumption needs.\n\nThe author also mentions they order pizza 4 times a year, which isn't too frequent. The wife's reasoning is about equality, but maybe she feels that the author is trying to dominate the decision or not respecting her preferences. The author brings up sushi as an example of their generosity, but the wife's response is about pizza. Maybe there's a pattern where the author is more flexible on sushi but expects a different split on pizza. The author's plan to take more after the wife eats her fill could be seen as manipulative. Even if the wife eats less, the author is taking more than she agreed to, which might not be respectful of her initial agreement to half.\n\nAlso, the wife gave permission to order the pizza because of the coupon, but perhaps she expected to split it equally. The author is going against her stated expectation. Even if the author thinks he's entitled to more, overriding her agreement could be seen as dismissive of her wishes. Relationships often require compromise, so maybe the author is being too rigid. The fact that the wife insists on equality might be about fairness in sharing, not just the physical size. Maybe she values equal sharing as a principle.\n\nThe author's strategy of letting her eat first and then taking the rest could lead to her having leftovers, but he's not allowing her to have them. That might be seen as underhanded. Even if he ends up eating more, he's technically violating her initial agreement by not respecting her 50% share. The key is whether the agreement was mutual. The wife allowed the pizza purchase under the condition of splitting it, so the author's plan to go against that agreement could be seen as the asshole move.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not respecting the agreed-upon split the wife wants. Even if his reasoning is about physical needs, the agreement was mutual. The wife's insistence on equality might be about shared values, and the author is undermining that by taking more. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not honoring the terms of the agreement they had, even if he thinks his split is fair. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
