My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple's disagreement over how to split a pizza they're ordering. The husband wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on half each. The husband also mentions other times he's made compromises, like taking her to sushi places even though he prefers cheaper options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife gave permission for the pizza because of a coupon, so he's allowed. He's ordering a large pizza because he likes it, not just for value. The wife wants equal halves, but he thinks his higher consumption justifies a bigger share. He's also made efforts to accommodate her preferences by taking her to sushi, even though it's more expensive for him.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness. The wife's point is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. She might see fairness as equal shares regardless of size or appetite. The husband argues that physical needs and appetite size matter. It's a classic split between equality vs. equity. But in relationships, people often compromise even when they don't agree to maintain harmony.\n\nThe husband's plan is to let her eat her half first, then take from what's left. That might leave her with leftovers, but he's not sharing the way she expects. However, he's not forcing her to eat natto; she's choosing that if she can't finish her half. So maybe he's sticking to his plan without being coercive.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel her wishes aren't respected. Even if he's being logical about their body sizes, the insistence on a 50-50 split shows she wants to balance things differently. The husband might be seen as dismissing her feelings of fairness for his own needs.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions they order pizza four times a year, and he takes her to sushi the same amount. So he's balancing his preferences with hers in other ways. But maybe the pizza issue is a small part of their interactions. However, the wife's strict 50-50 could be about more than the pizza\u2014possibly about wanting equal consideration in shared expenses or meals.\n\nAnother angle: Is it about control? If he's taking more, does that make him seem dominant? The wife might feel her autonomy is being undermined, even if it's just pizza. The husband's solution of letting her eat first and then taking what's left could be seen as manipulative, though he claims he's not feeling bad about it.\n\nIn relationships, these small things can build up. If the husband continues this approach, it could lead to resentment. But the question is whether he's in the wrong in this specific instance. From a fairness standpoint, if he's not being physically or emotionally abusive, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, from the wife's perspective, not respecting her preference for equality might be an issue.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's actions are respecting her wishes. Since he's not agreeing to split 50-50 and is instead taking what he wants, even if it's through a different method, he might be in the wrong because he's not honoring her expectation of equality, even if he's making other concessions elsewhere. Alternatively, if the wife is being unreasonable by not considering his needs, then he's justified. But in the context of relationship dynamics, respecting mutual expectations is important. So maybe the husband is in the wrong here.\n"
