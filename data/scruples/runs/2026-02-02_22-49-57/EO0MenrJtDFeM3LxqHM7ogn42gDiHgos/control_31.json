My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting more than half the pizza. The situation is that the author and his wife have agreed to order a pizza using a coupon, but there's a disagreement on how to split it. The wife wants half each, while the author thinks a 60-40 split is fair based on their sizes and eating habits. The wife's argument is about equality, while the author's is about practicality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many relationships, compromise is key. The wife's stance on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. The author's argument is based on physical needs, but maybe the wife feels that equal sharing is important for balance in their shared expenses and habits. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that pizza is something he really likes and orders infrequently, which might justify wanting more. However, the wife's preference for sushi is similar in frequency. The author's plan to take the remaining of her half once she's full could be seen as taking advantage, which might be the issue here. The wife might feel disrespected if her agreed-upon half is taken away without her consent after she's done eating. \n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. If the wife gave permission to buy the pizza, maybe she expected a fair split as part of that agreement. The author's plan to not honor the 50-50 split could be seen as breaking that trust. The mention of her having to eat natto instead of leftover pizza might indicate that the author is being inconsiderate of her breakfast plans, adding to the problem.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect, prior agreements, and fairness. While the author has valid reasons for wanting more, the way he plans to take the pizza after she's done might be seen as unfair. The wife's insistence on equal split could be about maintaining balance and mutual respect in their shared life. The author's approach might be perceived as selfish, even if based on personal needs. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
