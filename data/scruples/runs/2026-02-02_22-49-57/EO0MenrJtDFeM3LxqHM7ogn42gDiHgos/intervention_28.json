My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places the same number, but he's not into the expensive sushi.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider what's fair here. The wife says they should be equal, so half each. The author argues for 60-40 based on their body sizes. But is that a valid reason? Maybe in some contexts, like if they were sharing a meal where portion sizes are based on appetite. However, relationships often involve compromising beyond just physical needs. They do other things for each other, like he takes her to sushi, but she's not reciprocating in the same way here. \n\nWait, the author is planning to take more than half by letting her eat until she's full, but then he'll eat the rest of her portion. That might come off as sneaky. Maybe the issue isn't just about the split but about how they approach sharing. The wife wants an equal split as a matter of fairness in their relationship, while the author is focusing on physical needs. \n\nIs it about equality versus practicality? The author's method of letting her eat first and then taking the rest could lead to her not getting her fair share, even if she eats less. But he's not forcing her to eat a certain amount; he's just taking the leftovers after she's done. \n\nAlso, the context of their other interactions: he orders cheap sushi, but she gets to choose the expensive ones. Maybe she feels that in other areas, he's not equally sharing, so she's trying to balance it out with the pizza. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are mutual respect and compromise. If both agreed that the coupon pizza is a special treat, maybe equal sharing is part of the agreement. The author's plan to undermine her portion after she's done might not be fair, even if he thinks he's earned it. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's agreement terms and is being self-serving. The answer might be A.\n"
