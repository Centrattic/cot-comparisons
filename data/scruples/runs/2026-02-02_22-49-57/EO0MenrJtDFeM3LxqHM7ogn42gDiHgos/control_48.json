My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is wrong for wanting more than half the pizza. The situation is that the husband ordered pizza using a coupon his wife allowed, but she wants an equal split. He argues he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. She insists on 50-50 because equality.\n\nFirst, the wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so that's a starting point. But the expectation of splitting it equally might not be about fairness but her own preferences. The husband's reasoning is based on physical differences, but maybe she's more sensitive about sharing or has dietary reasons. Also, he mentions he's okay with her eating natto instead of leftovers, which could be seen as a bit manipulative or not considering her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about equal portions. Sometimes, compromise is key. If the wife is uncomfortable with the 60-40 split, maybe the husband should respect her wishes even if he thinks it's unfair. But the husband's plan to take more after she's done seems like he's not respecting her initial boundary. She agreed to the order, but the split is a separate issue. If she's okay with him eating more when she's full, maybe it's her choice. However, the husband's intention to not feel bad about taking more after she's eaten might come off as dismissive. \n\nThe key here is whether respecting her initial demand for half is more important than his own preferences. Since she's the one who set the expectation, maybe the husband is in the wrong for not honoring that agreement. Alternatively, if the agreement was just about buying the pizza, not the split, then maybe he's not wrong. The question is about whether expecting equal portions is reasonable. In many relationships, people adjust based on individual needs, but if she's insisting on equality as a principle, he might need to comply. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the husband might be wrong for not respecting her preference for equal sharing, even if he thinks his way is fair. Answer A.\n"
