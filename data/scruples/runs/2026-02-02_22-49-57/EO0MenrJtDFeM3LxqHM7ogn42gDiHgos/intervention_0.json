My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The wife wants half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he orders pizza a few times a year and takes her to sushi places, but she insists on equal shares despite his arguments.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness in sharing food based on individual needs versus equality. The wife is demanding equal halves, emphasizing equality, while the author argues for a split based on their physical size and eating habits. The author's plan is to let the wife eat her share first, which he expects she'll finish less than half of, then take the rest. He doesn't feel bad about this.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, mutual respect, and communication. In many relationships, compromise is important. The wife might feel that fairness means equal portions, even if the husband eats more. However, the husband is justifying his stance based on practical needs. If they've discussed this before and she still insists, maybe there's a deeper issue about how they view fairness in their relationship.\n\nThe author's approach is a bit underhanded by letting her eat first and then taking the rest. That could be seen as not being honest. Instead of finding a middle ground, he's planning to take advantage of her declared half. That might come off as selfish, even if he believes he's entitled to more. The fact that he's not going to feel bad about it suggests he's prioritizing his own desires over her potential disappointment, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid point about their physical differences. But in a relationship, it's not just about what's technically fair, but how each partner feels respected. If the wife is uncomfortable with unequal splits, the husband should find another way to express his preference without undermining her. Maybe splitting the pizza isn't the only way to share a meal. Alternatively, he could order two different dishes to accommodate both their preferences without fighting over portions.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's method of taking the remaining pizza after she's eaten is respectful. Since he's planning to do this without her knowledge, it's a bit sneaky and could harm trust. Even if he's right about the 60-40, his approach is dishonest. The correct approach would be to communicate and find a solution both agree on, rather than silently going against her wishes.\n"
