My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves splitting a pizza between him and his wife.\n\nFirst, the husband got permission from his wife to order a pizza using a coupon. He's ordering a large one because he likes eating a lot, not just for the value. The wife wants an equal split, 50-50. He thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. They've had this discussion before, and she insists on equality.\n\nHe also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper items while she gets the expensive ones. He points out this balance as part of their relationship. His plan is to let her eat her share, which he expects to be less than half, and then finish the rest himself, even if she has to eat natto for breakfast instead of leftovers.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The wife wants equal division, which is a common practice, but the husband argues based on physical size and appetite. Is it fair to split based on body size? Some people might think that when sharing a meal, it's about what each person actually consumes, not just the size. Others might see the 50-50 split as equal treatment, regardless of individual needs.\n\nHe mentions their other exchanges, like sushi outings where he lets her have the better options. That might balance things out. But in the case of the pizza, he's planning to take more than half, which he expects she'll agree to because she won't eat her share. However, the method he's using\u2014letting her decide her portion and then taking the rest\u2014might seem manipulative or unfair. If she eats less than half, he's taking the remainder, which could be seen as taking advantage of her.\n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, he did get permission to order the pizza, but the way he's handling the division might be where the issue is. The wife wanted an equal split, perhaps to show fairness in their relationship. If he's taking more than his fair share under the guise of her eating less, he's not respecting her initial agreement. Even if he expects her to eat less, the decision to split it 50-50 was part of her condition for allowing the pizza. By overriding that, he's not honoring her terms, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, his plan to let her have natto for breakfast the next day might be a petty way of asserting his point, which isn't great for a relationship. While he's justifying it based on fairness, the act of making her have a less preferred breakfast could be seen as holding something over her head. That might contribute to the perception that he's the asshole.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even though he's trying to be fair based on his perspective, his actions might be undermining his wife's wishes. The key is whether respecting her initial agreement (50-50) is more important than his own sense of fairness based on appetite. Since she explicitly stated her expectation and he's choosing to disregard it, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
