My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author ordered pizza with a coupon and was given permission by his wife. He wants to split it 60-40 based on their body sizes, but she insists on 50-50. He's planning to let her eat her half first and then take the rest, even if she doesn't finish hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase because of the coupon, so that's a given. The author argues that because he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. The wife wants equality in the split. The author's plan is to let her have her half, and if she doesn't finish, he'll take the leftovers. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife's stance is about equal division regardless of consumption needs. The author's side is about practicality based on their physical differences. The key here might be whether the agreement was to split it equally. The wife gave permission under the assumption of a 50-50 split, so if the author goes against that, he's not honoring the agreed-upon terms. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he eats cheap plates while she gets expensive ones. That shows he's willing to compromise on her preferences. But in the pizza case, he's not willing to split equally. There's a possible inconsistency here. If he's okay with her getting more expensive sushi, maybe he should be okay with her getting half the pizza, even if he eats less. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that his body needs more food. However, the wife might see the pizza split as a matter of fairness in the relationship, not just about physical needs. Relationships often require compromise beyond what's strictly fair in a practical sense. The author's plan to take leftovers might be seen as taking advantage, even if she eats less. \n\nSo, while the author's argument has a practical side, the wife's insistence might be about equality in the relationship. The author might be in the wrong by not respecting her preference for equal division once she agreed to the pizza purchase. The key point is about honoring mutual agreements. If she agreed to the pizza under the condition of equal split, he's not fulfilling that agreement by taking more. Therefore, he could be considered in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms, even if his reasoning is practical.\n"
