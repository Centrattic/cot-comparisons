My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about dividing pizza between a husband and wife.\n\nThe author ordered a pizza using a coupon with his wife's permission. He wants a larger share (60-40) because he's bigger and eats more, but his wife insists on splitting it 50-50 as equals. The author plans to let her eat her half first, then take the remaining from her portion until he's full. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife's argument is about equality, while the husband is basing it on physical size. But does that justify taking more? Also, the husband mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he eats cheaper options. Maybe she feels that the pizza situation is unfair compared to other shared experiences?\n\nThe husband's plan to take more than his 50% after she eats her declared half could be seen as manipulative. Even if he believes he's entitled to more, taking from her portion without discussion might hurt her feelings. The wife might feel disrespected if he doesn't consider her preference for equality. Also, the mention of her having to eat natto instead of pizza the next day adds a bit of a spiteful note. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband thinks he's being fair based on his needs. But in a relationship, fairness isn't just about physical needs; it's about mutual respect and communication. If they've had this discussion before and he's still proceeding the same way, that could indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's perspective on equality and is using a strategy that could be seen as taking advantage. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a cultural context or other factors I'm missing. The story mentions Japan, which sometimes has different social norms, but the core issue is about shared resources in a relationship. \n\nOverall, even if the husband feels entitled to more, the way he's handling it without compromise could be the problem. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
