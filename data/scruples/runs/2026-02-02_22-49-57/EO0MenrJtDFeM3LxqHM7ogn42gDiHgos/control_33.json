My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation.\n\nSo the author wants to order pizza, which his wife is against because it's unhealthy and expensive. He got a coupon and she allowed him to buy it. Now, they're arguing about splitting the pizza. The author thinks a 60-40 split is fair because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife wants equal halves. \n\nHmm. The key points here are fairness, equality, and mutual respect. The wife wants equal shares because they're supposed to be equals. The author, on the other hand, is using physical size and appetite as justification for an unequal split. \n\nBut in a relationship, fairness isn't just about physical needs. It's also about respecting each other's preferences and values. The wife might not like pizza as much, but she agreed to the purchase. The author is okay with her eating natto instead of leftover pizza, which could leave her with something she might not like as much. Also, the fact that he's planning to take the remaining of her half after she's done shows he's not considering her feelings. \n\nThe author mentions that he takes her to a sushi place, where he orders cheap and she gets expensive. That seems like he's already making concessions. But then he's not willing to compromise on the pizza. Maybe the issue is about the principle of equality. The wife's insistence on equal halves might be about fairness and not wanting to feel cheated, even if he eats more. \n\nAlso, his plan to take her leftovers isn't respectful. It's a bit manipulative. Instead of having an open discussion and finding a middle ground, he's planning to take advantage of her sharing. That's not a healthy approach in a relationship. \n\nSo, even though he has a point about his appetite, the way he's handling the situation and not respecting his wife's perspective could make him the asshole. The core issue is about mutual respect and finding a balance, not just about who is right based on physical needs.\n"
