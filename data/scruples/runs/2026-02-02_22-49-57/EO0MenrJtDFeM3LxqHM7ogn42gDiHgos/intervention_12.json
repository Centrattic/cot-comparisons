My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon with his wife's permission. He wants to split it 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more. His wife insists on 50-50, emphasizing equality. The author plans to let her eat until she's full, which he expects to be less than half, then take the rest.\n\nFirst, the wife gave consent for the pizza purchase, so there's no issue there. The main conflict is about the division. The author argues that his larger size justifies a bigger share. The wife sees equality as 50-50. But equality isn't always about equal shares; it can also consider individual needs. The author's plan to take advantage of her eating less and then taking the remainder might seem sneaky, but he's not forcing her to eat a certain amount. He's just taking what's left after she's done. However, manipulating leftovers by taking her half after she's full could be seen as unfair. The key points are mutual consent, differing perspectives on fairness, and the author's approach to leftovers. The author isn't violating any agreement, but his method might be seen as exploiting the situation. The answer hinges on whether fairness is about equal division or proportional needs. Since the wife consented to the purchase and he's not stealing, the author isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
