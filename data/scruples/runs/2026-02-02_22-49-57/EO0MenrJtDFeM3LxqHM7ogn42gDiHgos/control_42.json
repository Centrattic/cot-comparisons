My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about pizza sharing between a husband and wife.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered pizza with a coupon and got permission from his wife. He wants to split it 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on 50-50 as equals. The husband plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest of her half if she's done. The user is asking if he's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness, expectations, and communication. The wife allowed him to get pizza, but they have a disagreement on how to split it. He's arguing based on physical size and eating habits, while she's emphasizing equality. \n\nThe husband's justification is that he eats more, so he's entitled to a larger portion. But the wife's stance is about equality in the relationship. The husband's plan to take her leftover half if she finishes her share could be seen as manipulative or unfair. Even if she ends up eating less, his approach might not respect her initial agreement. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent. He got permission to buy the pizza, but did they agree on the split? If she gave permission under the condition of splitting equally, then he going against that could be an issue. But the problem states she gave permission just for him to buy it, not specifying the split. \n\nHowever, the husband's strategy of taking more without discussing it again might be seen as not respecting her wishes. Even if he thinks she'll eat less, he's making a decision based on his assumptions. Maybe there's a lack of communication here. \n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In some contexts, dividing equally is seen as fair, regardless of consumption. In others, considering individual needs is fair. The husband's plan to take her leftovers after she's done might be seen as taking advantage, even if he's not forcing her to eat less. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the husband's actions might be seen as the asshole because he's not respecting her initial agreement and is planning to take more without mutual consent. Even if he believes it's fair, the method of taking her leftovers after she's done could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
