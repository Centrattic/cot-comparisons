My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The scenario involves the author and his wife having a disagreement over how to split the pizza. The wife wants an equal split, 50-50, while the author thinks a 60-40 split is fairer because he's taller, bigger, and eats more. The author mentions that he orders pizza four times a year and also takes her to sushi, but when they go to sushi, he eats cheaper kids' plates while she can have the more expensive ones. He's planning to let her eat her fill first, which he thinks will be less than half, and then he'll take the rest of her half. If she's not full, she'll have to eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their agreement. The wife gave permission for the pizza because he found a coupon, understanding that he likes it. But she still insists on splitting it equally. The author feels that his physical size and eating habits justify a larger share. The key points here are compromise, equality, and mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nThe wife's stance is about equality, treating each other as equal partners. The author's argument is based on practicality\u2014he eats more and needs more food. There's a cultural aspect too, since they're in Japan, and pizza might be more expensive there. The author is making a point that he's already accommodating her by taking her to sushi, where he spends less on himself. But the wife still wants the pizza split equally.\n\nNow, the author's plan to take more than half after she eats her fill might be seen as underhanded. If she eats first, she might not even finish her half, allowing him to take the rest. But this could be seen as not being transparent and maybe a bit manipulative. Also, making her eat natto instead of pizza the next day if there's leftovers might be a bit harsh, even if he doesn't feel bad about it.\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't just about physical needs but also about emotional and social considerations. The wife's insistence on equality might stem from a desire for fairness in their shared expenses and consumption. The author's approach could come off as dismissive of her feelings, even if his reasoning is practical. The fact that he's already compromising by taking her to sushi but still wants an unequal split on pizza might highlight a double standard from her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's argument that he eats more and is bigger could be a valid point. People have different appetites, and it's reasonable to adjust portions accordingly. However, the way he's planning to execute this\u2014by letting her eat first and then taking the leftovers\u2014might not be the best approach. It could be seen as a way to avoid direct conflict but ends up being unfair in practice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether his actions are respectful of his wife's wishes. Since she agreed to the purchase under the condition of an equal split, he's choosing to ignore that agreement. Even if his reasoning is practical, not respecting her terms could be seen as the issue. Relationships often require mutual respect for agreements, even if one party feels they're not perfectly fair.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a practical reason for wanting more, respecting his wife's terms is important. By not adhering to her agreed-upon split and planning to take more through indirect means, he might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not honoring the agreement they made, which is a breach of trust and respect.\n"
