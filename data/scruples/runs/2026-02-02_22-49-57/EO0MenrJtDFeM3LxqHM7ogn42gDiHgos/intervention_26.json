My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza between him and his wife. He ordered pizza because he really likes it and got a coupon, and she gave permission. The issue is the split: he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more, but she wants a 50-50 split.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider their agreement. Did they have any prior agreement? The author mentions he's brought up the 60-40 before but she insists on 50-50. So maybe there's a history here. She might be setting boundaries for equality, while he's arguing based on physical needs. \n\nHe also points out that he takes her to sushi, which she likes, and he's willing to eat the cheaper options so she can have the better ones. That seems like a balance. But then he plans to take her leftover pizza after she eats her \"declared half.\" That might seem manipulative or unfair to her. \n\nIs it about fairness or equality? The wife's argument is equality, maybe seeing the relationship as equal partners. The author's argument is about practicality and needs. But in relationships, compromises are important. If he's going to take more after she's eaten her half, that could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that pizza is a taste from his home he loves, but she's given permission because he found a coupon. So she's given consent with the condition of splitting it. If he's going to ignore that condition, maybe he's not respecting her terms. \n\nHe says he doesn't plan to feel bad about it, which might come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even if he believes he's right, not considering her perspective could be where the problem is. \n\nSo, the key points are: mutual agreement terms, respect for each other's preferences, and whether the author is being fair in his approach. If he's going to take her portion after she's had her fill, that's not splitting but taking more after she's done. That might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the author's plan to take her leftovers isn't fair. Even if he thinks it's just, she might feel forced into a compromise she didn't agree to. So maybe he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her agreed-upon terms and is being sneaky about taking more than his share.\n"
