My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband wants 60% because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50% each. The husband plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest of her half once she's full.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife gave permission to order pizza because he used a coupon. She might feel that since it's a shared expense and they're equals, the split should be equal. The husband argues that his body size and appetite justify a 60-40 split. He also mentions he takes her to sushi, which might be a way of balancing things since he likes her taste more.\n\nThe husband's plan is to let her eat her half, and then take the remaining from her half. But that seems a bit sneaky. If she's full after her half, he takes the rest. But maybe she's not full? The problem is that the wife wants equality, but the husband thinks equality isn't fair given their different appetites. \n\nIs it fair to split based on body size? Some people might say that in a relationship, partners should consider each other's needs and not just go by physical attributes. The husband could argue that he's compensating by taking her to sushi, but the wife might see that as different because she enjoys sushi more. The pizza is his comfort food, so maybe he's valuing his preference more than hers. \n\nThe husband's plan to take her leftover pizza after she eats her half might come off as manipulative. If he's already agreed to a 50-50 split, taking the rest without her consent could be seen as unfair. The wife might feel disrespected if he's not honoring the agreed split. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband could see this as a compromise since he's allowing her to eat first. But if she's not full, she might feel like she's getting less than she deserves. The key issue here might be about mutual respect and finding a solution that both parties agree on. The husband is not wrong for wanting a fair split based on his needs, but the way he's handling it by taking the remaining pizza after she's done might not be fair. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's approach could be seen as inconsiderate, even if his reasoning makes sense. The way he's planning to take the remaining pizza without her consent is the main point of contention. Therefore, the answer might be A, that he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms and is being manipulative.\n"
