My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple arguing over splitting a pizza. The husband wants a 60/40 split based on his larger size and appetite, while the wife insists on a 50/50 split. He's bought the pizza with a coupon she approved, and he's also taking her to sushi places where he spends more on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness and mutual respect. The husband's argument is that since he's bigger and eats more, he should get a larger share. The wife, on the other hand, believes in equality. But equality doesn't always mean equal portions when needs differ. For example, if one person is significantly larger or has a higher metabolism, it's reasonable to adjust portions accordingly. However, the husband's plan to take more after she eats her half could be seen as manipulative, especially if he's taking advantage of her self-declared portion.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions he's making an effort to take her to sushi places where he spends more on her. This shows he's trying to balance things out in another way. But the wife might feel that the pizza is a shared meal and should be split equally regardless of their sizes. There's a cultural aspect too\u2014maybe in Japan, sharing equally is more emphasized, which could influence her perspective.\n\nThe key point here is mutual respect. If both parties are compromising in their own ways, but the husband is using her strict 50/50 rule to get more, maybe he's being unfair. However, if the wife is rigid and not considering his needs, that's also an issue. The husband's plan to take more after she's done might not be respectful of her decision to split it equally. Even if she ends up eating less than half, he's still taking her declared portion, which could be seen as dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband isn't taking the entire pizza. He's allowing her to eat first, but then uses the remaining as his own. This might be a way to get more without explicitly violating her rule, but it's a bit of a loophole. The wife might feel tricked if she ends up with less, even if she agreed to the halves. The husband's approach could come off as sneaky, undermining her expectations of fairness.\n\nIn terms of fairness, perhaps the 60/40 split is more practical given their sizes, but the husband's method of taking more after she eats is underhanded. It would be more respectful to discuss and agree on a different split beforehand rather than using her initial request to take more. The wife's insistence on equality is her right, but if the husband is willing to adjust that in other ways (like sushi), maybe he's being reasonable. However, the way he's planning to take more without her knowing might cross a line.\n"
