My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The main issue is about splitting a pizza between him and his wife.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered a large pizza using a coupon, which the wife allowed. He argues that because he's bigger and eats more, he should get 60%, while she gets 40%. The wife insists on a 50-50 split, citing equality. The husband plans to take more than half after she eats, even if she doesn't finish her half.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about fairness, expectations, and compromise. The wife's main argument is about equality, but the husband's justification is based on physical size and appetite. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The wife is concerned about health and cost, but allowed him to order the pizza. She might feel that equality in sharing is important, regardless of appetite. However, the husband's plan to take more than half after she eats could be seen as unfair if she ends up not getting her share. \n\nBut then again, the husband is also making an effort by taking her to sushi, which she likes, even though he prefers cheaper options. That shows consideration. However, the pizza situation is about their shared meal. The problem arises when he takes more than agreed upon, which might make the wife feel disrespected.\n\nIs it wrong to not split equally? Maybe not, but it's more about mutual respect. If the wife agreed to the coupon use but still expects equal sharing, the husband's plan to override her expectation could be seen as dismissive. The husband's approach might lead to resentment because he's not respecting her boundary, even if she might not finish her half. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about body size and eating more isn't necessarily a strong argument for unequal division, especially in a relationship where mutual respect and communication are key. The fact that he's known she doesn't like pizza adds complexity. If she's eating natto the next day, maybe she's not even that hungry for pizza, but the principle of respecting her agreement is important.\n\nSo, while the husband's actions are based on his needs, the wrong is in not respecting her set boundary. The wife had a condition (half each) for allowing the pizza. By not adhering to that, he's disregarding her terms. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
