My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. So the situation is that the author ordered a pizza with a coupon, got permission from his wife. He wants 60% and she wants 50-50. He's bigger, eats more, and mentions he splurges on sushi for her four times a year. She insists on splitting equally despite their different appetites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness. The author argues that because he's taller and eats more, 60-40 is fair. The wife wants equality regardless of size. The key here is whether splitting food equally is a standard expectation in relationships. Some people might think equality is the norm, others might consider individual needs.\n\nThe author plans to let her eat her fill first, which would likely leave less than half for him. But he's okay with her having leftovers for breakfast? Wait, no\u2014he says she'll have to eat natto instead of leftover pizza. Wait, the author says he'll eat the remainder of her declared half until he's full. So he's taking her half if she doesn't finish it. That seems manipulative. He's not just taking his share, he's taking her share if she doesn't eat it all. That might be the issue. \n\nAlso, the wife's insistence on half is because they're supposed to be equals. The author is using his physical size as a justification. But maybe equality in a relationship isn't about splitting food based on body size. The author mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheap while she gets expensive. Is that a fair trade? Maybe that's a separate issue, but the main question is about the pizza.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's taking her share after she's done eating, that's taking advantage. Even if he's bigger, forcing her to have less than half and then taking the rest seems unfair. The wife's argument is about equality, and the author's plan undermines that. Also, the author isn't respecting her decision to split it 50-50. Maybe the problem is the author's approach to enforcing his own ratio by taking leftovers. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's terms and is taking advantage of her leftovers. Even if he has a different appetite, the agreed-upon split was supposed to be 50-50, and he's circumventing that.\n"
