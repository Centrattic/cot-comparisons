My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The author's wife doesn't like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive, but she gave permission after a coupon was found. The author wants 60% of the pizza because he's taller, bigger, and eats more. The wife insists on equal halves for equality. The author plans to take more than half after she eats her \"half.\"\n\nFirst, consider the fairness angle. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase, so she's participating in the meal. The author argues that his higher caloric needs justify a larger share. But does that hold weight? While physical size might mean he needs more food, pizza isn't a requirement for him like sushi is for her. However, he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences with sushi, which she likes more. That's a point in his favor.\n\nThe wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness or control. If the couple is sharing the cost, maybe she's contributing equally despite not liking pizza. The author's plan to take more than her share after she eats could be seen as manipulative. He might be exploiting her agreement to get more pizza without her consent. Even if he's bigger, taking more without her agreement could be disrespectful. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The wife agreed to split it 50-50, which is a compromise. The author is not following through on that agreement, which might break trust. The sushi example shows he's willing to be flexible for her, but she isn't reciprocating. However, the pizza scenario is different because he's the one who wanted it. \n\nIs it fair to take more when she's agreed to share equally? The author might think it's justified, but the wife might feel cheated. The author's plan to take more could be seen as sneaky, undermining her decision. So, even if he's bigger, respecting her agreement is important for a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by not honoring the agreed split, even if he has his reasoning.\n"
