Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who has two kids, 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather on the father's side passed away in March. The parents are divorced and not on great terms. The author loved their ex-FIL and they even lived with them at one point. The funeral process was spread out over a few days due to being a veteran and the cemetery's schedule. The kids missed school on Friday for viewings but had a tough time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial is on Monday, and the kids have tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go to the burial, and they said no. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending. The question is whether the author is wrong for not forcing the kids to go.\n\nFirst, I should consider the children's well-being. The kids had a hard time with the viewings and the weekend was already difficult for them. They were emotional and crying. Forcing them to attend another event, especially a burial, which might be even more stressful, could be traumatic. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go, so respecting their wishes is important. The author is prioritizing their children's emotional health over attending the burial, which seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the ex-MIL's feelings. The author explained the situation, but the ex-MIL was upset. However, the author isn't responsible for managing the ex-MIL's emotions. The kids are minors, and the parent's decision to follow the children's wishes, especially after they've already been through the initial events, might be the right call. The author isn't forcing them to attend, so it's not about avoiding responsibility but about the kids' well-being.\n\nAlso, the burial is on a school day with tests. Missing school for a burial is a significant decision. Since the kids didn't want to go and the author is their parent, making the call based on their age and emotional state is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family tradition or important for closure. But in this case, the kids have already attended the viewings and the wake, and they expressed feeling they had said goodbye. The burial is a separate event, and the kids' refusal to attend should be respected. The parent's role is to protect their children's mental health, especially when they're young and dealing with grief.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's decision seems to be in the best interest of the children. They aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their kids' emotional needs over attending the burial, especially when the children themselves don't want to go and are already dealing with the loss. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is unfortunate, but the parent isn't obligated to satisfy external family members' expectations in this situation. So the answer is B.\n"
