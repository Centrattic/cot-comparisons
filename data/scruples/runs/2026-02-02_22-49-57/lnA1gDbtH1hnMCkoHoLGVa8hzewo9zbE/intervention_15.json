Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether sending the kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and the author is divorced from their father. The author loved the ex-FIL. The funeral events were on Friday and Saturday, with the burial on Monday. The kids attended the viewings and wake, found it hard, and were emotional. The author was told that the kids wouldn't attend the burial today because they had tests and the kids said they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not forcing the kids to go to the burial. On one hand, the author is considering the children's well-being, their emotional state, and their school commitments. On the other, the ex-MIL is upset, implying that the children should have been present for the burial.\n\nFactors to consider: Age of the children. At 6 and 9, they might not fully understand the burial process. They were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in the casket. Forcing them to attend another event could cause more distress. The author respected the kids' wishes, which is important for their emotional health. Also, the burial is a specific event with scheduling constraints, and the kids have tests. The author is a parent, so their primary responsibility is to the children's well-being and education.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the burial is a significant moment for the family, and the kids, as relatives, should be there. But the author did take them to the viewings and wake, which were more involved. The kids themselves expressed not wanting to go, and the author honored that. The ex-MIL's reaction is part of the situation, but the author's decision is based on the children's needs.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the key is whether the author acted unreasonably. The author seems to have made a compassionate choice, considering the children's feelings and the practical aspects. The ex-MIL's disappointment is understandable but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The decision to prioritize the kids' comfort and school over the burial, especially when the kids didn't want to go, seems justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
