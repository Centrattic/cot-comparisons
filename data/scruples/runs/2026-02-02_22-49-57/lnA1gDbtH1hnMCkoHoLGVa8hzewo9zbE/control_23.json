Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their children attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is a bit complex because of the family dynamics involved. \n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The author mentions that the kids had tests at school on the day of the burial and that they themselves didn't want to go, feeling they had already said goodbye. The author prioritized their children's emotional well-being and school commitments over attending the funeral. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't going, but the author's decision is based on the kids' wishes and their own understanding of what's best for them. The key points here are the children's emotional state, their age, their expressed desire not to go, and the practical aspect of school. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions for their children's well-being, especially concerning their mental health. Forcing children who are already distressed to attend another event might cause more harm. Additionally, the author had already taken them to other services, so the refusal to go to the burial is a choice the kids made, which the author respected.\n\nThe ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author is the parent, so the priority is on the children's needs. The fact that the ex and the author aren't on the best terms might add some tension, but the main issue is the children's welfare. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
