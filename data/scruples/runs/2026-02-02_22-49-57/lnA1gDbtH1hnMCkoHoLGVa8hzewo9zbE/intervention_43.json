Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is at fault. \n\nFirst, the context: The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings and a wake over the weekend, which were emotionally taxing for them. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They've decided they don't want to go anymore, saying they've already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset because they didn't attend the burial.\n\nSo, the parent had to choose between the kids' well-being and their wishes versus attending the funeral. The parent respected the kids' decision, which seems empathetic. The kids are young and might not understand the cultural or family expectations around funerals. However, the parent's role is to protect their children's emotional health, especially after they've already been through a lot. \n\nThe key points are: the kids were already at the viewings and the wake, were emotional, had tests, and didn't want to go. The parent didn't force them. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent's actions seem to prioritize the children's emotional state. \n\nIn many cultures, family events are important, but when it comes to children's mental health, parents usually have the right to make decisions that protect them from further trauma. The kids have expressed their desire not to attend, so forcing them could be harmful. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
