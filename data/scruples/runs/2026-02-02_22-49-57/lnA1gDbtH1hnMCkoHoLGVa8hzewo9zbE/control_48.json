Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they didn't take their kids to their grandfather's burial because the kids didn't want to go. The grandfather was a Veteran, which might mean the burial is a significant event. The parents are divorced, and the kids missed school on Friday for viewings but had tests on Monday, the burial day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, pretty young. They already had to attend viewings and were upset. The author explains that the kids said they'd already said goodbye and didn't want to go. Forcing them might cause more trauma. On the other hand, not attending the burial might upset the ex-MIL and grandfather's family, especially since it's a formal event. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the kids' emotional state and their decision. The mother might be prioritizing the children's comfort over family obligations. However, some might argue that attending the burial is a cultural or family expectation, especially for a Veteran. But the kids are with the mother now, and she's making the decision for their well-being. \n\nAlso, the divorce and strained relationship between the parents could play a role. The ex-MIL's reaction might be more about her own feelings or expectations rather than the kids not being allowed to attend. The mother did take them to the viewings and the service, which were on Friday and Saturday. The burial is a specific event that might be more about the family's closure. \n\nIn terms of school, the kids had tests on Monday. Missing school might not be justified if the child is okay. The mother let them decide, which is age-appropriate. The key points are the children's well-being, their own wishes, and the mother's decision to respect that. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision that prioritized their children's emotional health and respected the kids' choice, which is important at their age. The ex-MIL's upset is unfortunate, but the mother's actions were considerate towards her children.\n"
