Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in this situation. The scenario is about a parent deciding not to take their kids to a grandfather's burial because the kids didn't want to go, even after attending the viewings and wake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotionally hard for them. They had tests at school on the burial day. The kids themselves didn't want to go to the burial, and the parent respected their wishes. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent is not the ex's spouse anymore, so maybe the obligation isn't as strong.\n\nI should think about the parent's responsibility. The kids' well-being is a priority. Forcing them to attend after they've already been through the viewings and wake might cause more trauma. The parent is respecting the kids' feelings, which is good parenting. Also, the school tests are a factor\u2014missing school for a burial when it's not mandatory might not be necessary, especially if the kids aren't keen on attending.\n\nAnother angle: the ex-MIL might feel slighted, but the parent is making a decision based on the children's needs. The parent isn't in a good relationship with the ex, but that doesn't mean they're wrong here. The focus is on the kids' emotional state. There's no legal obligation for the parent to take the kids to the burial since they're not in a co-parenting situation that requires such actions.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the kids should attend out of respect, but the parent is considering the children's emotional well-being. The kids had already said goodbye, so maybe attending the burial isn't essential for them. The parent isn't being disrespectful to the grandfather; they honored him at the viewings and wake. The decision is about the kids' comfort, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The parent made a compassionate choice based on the children's needs and their own wishes.\n"
