Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not making their kids go to their grandfather's burial. The kids were already at the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The actual burial is on Monday, which is a school day. The kids have tests today and didn't want to go. The author chose to send them to school instead.\n\nFirst, the kids are young, 6 and 9 years old. They already had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket during the viewings. The author mentions they were emotional and it was tough for them. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go to the burial. So, the parent respected their wishes. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending. But the parent is prioritizing the children's well-being and their school obligations. The burial is a small event with only a few family members. The kids had already participated in the earlier services. Forcing them to attend another event might have been traumatic, especially since they were already upset.\n\nAlso, the parent is divorced from the ex, and their relationship isn't great. The parent is making the decision based on what's best for the kids, considering their age and emotional state. The military burial might be a formal event, which might not be suitable for young children who are already distressed. Plus, the school tests are important, and missing school could have educational consequences.\n\nIn terms of cultural or family expectations, sometimes it's expected to attend all services, but the parent is balancing that against the children's needs. The key factors here are the children's emotional health, their own wishes, and the educational impact. The parent isn't being disrespectful to the grandfather's memory; they've already attended the main services. The burial is a smaller event, and the kids are choosing not to attend. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. They made a tough call but one that prioritizes the kids' well-being.\n"
