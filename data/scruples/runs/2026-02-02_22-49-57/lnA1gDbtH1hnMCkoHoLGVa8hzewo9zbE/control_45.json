Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already missed school for the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The user mentions that the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket and were emotional. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day. The kids have tests, and they themselves said they don't want to go. The author decided to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the children's well-being and their wishes. The kids are young and have already been through a lot emotionally. They've already attended the viewings and the wake, which were difficult for them. Making them go to the burial might add more stress, especially with school tests. The author respected the kids' decision to not attend, which shows consideration for their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't there. But the author is the parent, and the decision to prioritize the kids' emotional state and school obligations over attending the burial might be seen as appropriate. The kids were allowed to express their choice, which is important for their autonomy.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation that children must attend all funeral events? Maybe, but the author's main responsibility is to the children's well-being. The grandfather was close to the family, but the kids are the ones who decided they had said goodbye. The author isn't forcing them to attend, which is probably the right call. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent made a tough decision based on the children's emotional needs and their own input.\n"
