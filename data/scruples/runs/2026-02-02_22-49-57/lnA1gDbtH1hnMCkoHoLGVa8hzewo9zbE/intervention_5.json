Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether sending the kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial is the right call.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The grandfather was their father's father, and the parents are divorced with a not-so-great relationship. The author loved their ex-FIL, but the kids are with their mother now. \n\nThe burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They themselves said they didn't want to go, feeling they'd already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending. The author is being accused of not forcing them to go.\n\nNow, considering the children's well-being is key here. The kids have been through a lot already with the viewings and the wake. They were emotional, crying, and it's their first family member passing away. Forcing them to attend a burial might add more trauma. The child's mental health is important, and respecting their wishes when they express not wanting to go seems supportive. \n\nAlso, the author had to balance the child's needs with the ex-family's expectations. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the children's comfort and the reality of school commitments (especially tests) are practical factors. The author explained the situation, which shows they tried to be considerate. \n\nIn some cultures, attending funerals is seen as important, but the children's emotional state should be prioritized. The kids are still young and might not grasp the significance of the burial in the same way adults do. They might have already processed their grief through the earlier viewings. \n\nThe author didn't force the kids; they let them decide, which is a good approach. Forcing them could lead to resentment or anxiety. The ex-MIL's disappointment is valid, but the author isn't responsible for the ex's family's expectations beyond explaining the situation. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they prioritized the children's emotional well-being and respected their wishes, especially in a sensitive time.\n"
