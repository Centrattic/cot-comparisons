Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day. The kids have tests, and they themselves don't want to go, saying they've already said goodbye. The author respects their wishes, and the ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nSo, the main points here. The kids are very young and already went through the initial services. They were emotional and found it difficult. The author prioritizes their children's well-being and their educational commitments. Also, the kids don't want to attend the burial, which is a significant factor. The author isn't forcing them to go against their will. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author has reasons related to the kids' age, their own feelings, and school responsibilities.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions based on their children's best interests. At this age, the kids might not fully understand the burial process, and forcing them could cause more trauma. The author is respecting their children's emotional needs. The school tests are also important, but maybe that's a secondary factor compared to the emotional aspect. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't making the kids go against their wishes. \n\nIn many cultures, attending a funeral is important, but when the children are the ones who don't want to go, especially after being through the initial services, the parent's decision might be seen as reasonable. The key here is the children's wishes and their emotional state. The author isn't in a good situation, but they're choosing what they think is best for the kids, considering their age and the fact that the kids have already processed their grief to some extent. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're prioritizing their children's emotional well-being and respecting their wishes, which is a valid parental decision.\n"
