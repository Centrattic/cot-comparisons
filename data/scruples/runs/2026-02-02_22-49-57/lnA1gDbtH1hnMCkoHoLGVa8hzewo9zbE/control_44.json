Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kids are 6 and 9. They already attended viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day. The kids opted not to go again. The ex-MIL is upset because they didn't attend the burial.\n\nThe author had to make a choice between the kids' school commitments and their emotional well-being. The kids were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather's body. Forcing them to go to another event might be retraumatizing. Also, the kids themselves said they had already said goodbye, so their decision should be respected. \n\nThe ex-MIL's anger is more about her own feelings rather than the kids' needs. The author prioritized the children's emotional state and their school responsibilities. It seems reasonable. The kids are young, and their needs come first. The author isn't in the wrong for not forcing them to attend. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
