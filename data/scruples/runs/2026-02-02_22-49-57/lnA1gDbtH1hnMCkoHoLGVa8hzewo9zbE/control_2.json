Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the parent) is wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already missed school for the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally difficult for them. The funeral is on a Monday, and they have tests. The children themselves don't want to go, saying they already said goodbye. The parent respects their wishes and sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent is trying to prioritize the kids' well-being and their school commitments.\n\nNow, thinking about the age of the children. At that age, attending a burial service might be traumatic, especially if they're already struggling with the loss. The parent has already allowed them to attend the viewings and wake, which were hard enough. Forcing them to attend the burial could cause more emotional distress. \n\nAlso, the parent is divorced from the ex, and the kids are with the author. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent is making a decision based on the children's current emotional state and their own input. The child's well-being is a primary concern here. \n\nSchool tests on a Monday after a weekend of grieving\u2014maybe the parent is also considering the children's education. The VA process delayed things, but the parent tried to balance the kids' needs. \n\nThe key points are the children's emotional state, their expressed wishes, and the parent's judgment to protect them. The ex-MIL's reaction is understandable but the parent isn't the one forcing the kids. The parent isn't wrong for respecting the kids' feelings here. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The parent is not in the wrong. They made a compassionate choice considering the kids' feelings and well-being.\n"
