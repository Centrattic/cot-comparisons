Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is about a parent (the author) who had to decide whether to send their kids to school or have them attend their grandfather's burial. The grandfather was on the father's side, and the parents are divorced. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotional for them. Now the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They said they don't want to go, so the mom sent them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the children's well-being. They were already upset at the viewings and the wake. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in a casket. Forcing them to attend another event might be traumatic. The kids were emotional, so maybe the mom made the right call by respecting their wishes.\n\nThen there's the ex-MIL's reaction. She's part of the family and upset that the kids aren't there. But the author is the parent, so her priority is the kids' emotional health. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go, which is a strong point. The author isn't forcing them, she's letting them decide. \n\nThe fact that the burial is a small event with only a few family members might also play a role. The kids might not have been the main attendees, especially if the ex's family is going. Also, the kids have school responsibilities. Missing school for a burial is a big thing, but the mom already took them out for the viewings and wake. The tests on Monday might be important, so she's balancing their education too.\n\nI also think about the parent's relationship with her ex. They're not on the best terms, but she loved her ex-FIL. She's trying to be respectful but also protecting her kids. The ex-MIL's reaction is harsh, but the mom isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her children's emotional state. \n\nIn most cases, respecting a child's wishes, especially after they've already experienced grief, is the responsible choice. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
