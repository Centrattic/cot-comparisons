Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, children who are already traumatized by the grandfather's death, and the parent making a choice based on the kids' well-being.\n\nFirst, the kids had already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotional. They were young and struggled with seeing their grandfather in the casket. The author mentioned that the children were upset and it was the first time they lost a close family member. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They themselves said they didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the parent prioritized the children's emotional state. The author is asking if that's the right call. From a psychological perspective, forcing children to attend a funeral they're not ready for could cause more trauma. The kids had already participated in the earlier services, which might be enough for them. The parent respected the children's wishes, which is important for their autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family traditions or expectations could be important. But given the circumstances\u2014children's emotional state, their own decision, and the tests\u2014the parent made a compassionate choice. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is more about her feelings than the kids' well-being. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
