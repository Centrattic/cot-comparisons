Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids are 6 and 9, they already went to the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They don't want to go, and the author sent them to school instead. The ex-mother-in-law is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's emotional well-being. The kids were already upset at the viewings and wake. The author mentions the kids are young and this is their first major loss. Forcing them to attend the burial might cause more trauma, especially if they don't want to be there. The kids themselves said they had already said goodbye, so the author respected their wishes.\n\nThen there's the practical aspect: the tests at school. Missing school for a burial is a valid reason, but the author might be balancing the child's educational needs against the family event. Since the kids are in school and have exams, the author might think it's better for them to focus on that, especially since they've already participated in the earlier services.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author isn't responsible for her feelings. The ex-spouse's family might expect the kids to attend, but the author's primary responsibility is to the children's well-being. The author made a decision based on the kids' emotional state and their own wishes, which seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, the author loved the ex-FIL and was close to him, so it's clear they care deeply. The fact that the author took them to the viewings and wake shows they wanted the kids to be part of the process. Now, respecting their decision not to go further is about honoring their emotional needs.\n\nI think the key points are the children's emotional state, their expressed wishes, and the author's role in protecting them. The author isn't forcing the kids; they're allowing the kids to decide and then acting in their best interest. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
