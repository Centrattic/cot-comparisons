Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent whose ex-spouse's father passed away. They're divorced, not on good terms, but they loved the ex's father. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now the burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author asked if they wanted to go to the burial, and they declined. The author then sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset about this. The question is whether the author is wrong for not forcing the kids to attend the burial.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the children's well-being, their age, the previous emotional impact of the viewings and wake, and the fact that they declined attending the burial. The parent made a choice based on the children's wishes and their own emotional state. The author also prioritized school obligations, especially with tests on that day. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent is considering the children's needs here.\n\nChildren that young might not fully understand funerals, and being forced to attend could cause more trauma. The kids already attended parts of the event and said goodbye. The parent respected their choice, which is important for their emotional health. The author isn't forcing them, just honoring their decision. School is important, but so is the children's mental health. The parent explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so they aren't hiding the truth. \n\nThe argument against the author might be that attending the burial is a family tradition or a way to respect the deceased. However, the children's current emotional state and their explicit refusal should weigh heavily. The parent is acting in the children's best interest. There's no indication of neglect; instead, the parent is being sensitive to their needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They made a compassionate choice based on the kids' feelings and their own well-being.\n"
