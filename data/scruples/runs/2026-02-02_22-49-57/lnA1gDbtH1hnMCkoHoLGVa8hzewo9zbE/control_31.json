Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, a school day, and they have tests. The kids themselves don't want to go. The author explains that the kids were emotional after seeing their grandfather in the casket and it was hard for them. The ex-MIL is upset they're not attending the burial.\n\nThe key points here are the children's well-being, their own wishes, and the educational aspect. The kids have already been to the viewings and wake, which were emotionally taxing. They're young and might need time to process the grief. Forcing them to attend the burial might cause more distress. Also, the fact that they have tests suggests that school is important, but maybe the school would have made exceptions for the burial. However, the parent listened to the kids' decision not to go, which shows consideration for their feelings.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the author's priority is the children's emotional health. The parent made a decision based on the kids' input and their own judgment as a caregiver. There's no indication that the author is being selfish; rather, they're acting in the kids' best interest. Cultural or family expectations might play a role, but the main factors here are the children's age, their expressed wishes, and their well-being. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
