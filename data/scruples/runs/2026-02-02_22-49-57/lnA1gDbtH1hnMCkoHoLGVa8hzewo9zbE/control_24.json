Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent trying to decide if they should have taken their young children to a funeral on a school day.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The father (the author) asked them if they wanted to go, and they declined, saying they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are the children's emotional well-being, their expressed wishes, and the educational aspect. The kids are very young and have already been through the viewings and wake. They might be overwhelmed by attending another event. Also, parents have a responsibility to consider their children's needs, especially their emotional state. The kids might be too young to understand the significance of the burial, or they might just be too exhausted from the previous days of attending services.\n\nForcing children to attend might cause more trauma, especially if they're not emotionally ready. The author respected their wishes, which is a good practice. However, some might argue that family traditions or the importance of the burial for the family dynamics could be a reason to attend. But given the children's age and the fact that they already participated in the earlier events, it's reasonable to prioritize their well-being.\n\nThe author also considered the school tests. Missing school could affect the kids' education, but the user might counter that the emotional impact is more critical. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to satisfy the ex-MIL's expectations, especially if it's not in the kids' best interest.\n\nSo, based on the children's well-being and their expressed desire not to attend, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
