Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent deciding not to take their kids to a grandfather's burial because the kids didn't want to go and had tests at school. The parent is divorced from the child's father, and the grandmother is upset that the kids aren't attending.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The kids already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally difficult. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. The parent explains that the kids themselves don't want to go, having already said goodbye. The grandmother is upset, but the parent is prioritizing the children's well-being and their school obligations.\n\nThe parent's decision seems to be based on the children's emotional state and their own wishes. Forcing kids to attend a burial, especially when they're young and have already been through the initial viewings, might be traumatic. The parent is respecting the children's feelings and considering their academic schedule, which is also important. The grandmother's reaction shows that she's not the only one upset, but the parent isn't the one causing the distress here. The ex-husband isn't mentioned as being upset, but the grandmother's upset is part of the conflict.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the parent is making a choice that prioritizes the children's emotional health and autonomy. The children expressed they're okay with not attending, so forcing them might be against their autonomy. The parent isn't ignoring the situation entirely; they were present for the first events. The burial is a less critical event because it's a smaller gathering with family members. The parent's explanation is clear and empathetic, which shows they care about the grandmother's feelings but have made a decision based on the children's needs.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't being inconsiderate. They made a tough call between the children's well-being and the grandmother's wishes. The grandmother's upset is understandable, but the parent isn't necessarily at fault here. The answer should be B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
