Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids already went to the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. They have tests today, it's a Monday, and they themselves don't want to go to the burial. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, so very young. They had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket during the viewings. The wake was also emotional. Making them go to another event, especially if they don't want to, could be traumatic. The author explained that the kids felt they had already said goodbye. That's important because the kids are expressing their own feelings and boundaries.\n\nNext, the practical aspects: tests at school. The author prioritized the kids' education and their own wishes. The burial is a Monday, which is a school day. Skipping school for a family event might not be feasible, especially if the kids have important tests. The author respected the kids' decision not to attend, which shows they value the children's autonomy and emotional state over external expectations.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable but maybe not the author's problem. The author is the parent, so their decision should be based on what's best for the children, not just family expectations. The author also loved the ex-FIL, so there's no indication of neglecting the grandfather's importance. The kids were present for earlier services, which is a way they honored him.\n\nCultural and emotional factors: some might argue that attending the burial is important for closure, but others would say respecting the children's wishes is key. Since the kids are young, they might not grasp the significance of the burial in the same way adults do. Forcing them could cause more distress than benefit.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made a decision based on the children's emotional needs and their own expressed wishes. The ex-MIL's upset is a family issue, but the parent's responsibility is to the children. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
