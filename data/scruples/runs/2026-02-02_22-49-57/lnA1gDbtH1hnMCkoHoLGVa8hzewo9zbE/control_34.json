Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, a recent death, and the kids already attending viewings and a wake, which were emotionally tough for them.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've already been to two viewings and a wake. The author mentions they were very emotional, crying, and it was hard for them. The burial is happening on a Monday, and the kids have important tests at school. They themselves don't want to go anymore, feeling they've already said goodbye. The author sends them to school instead, which upsets the ex-MIL.\n\nThe key points here are the children's emotional well-being versus the obligation to attend the burial. The author is prioritizing the kids' needs, considering their emotional state and the importance of their school exams. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author's decision is based on the children's expressed wishes and their own judgment as a parent.\n\nIn such cases, parents are generally expected to make decisions in their children's best interest. Forcing children to attend a burial when they're not emotionally ready and when it conflicts with their own needs (like school) might be seen as insensitive. The author is respecting the kids' feelings here, which is a responsible parenting choice. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
