Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about sending the kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9, which are pretty young ages. The grandfather passed away, and the kids had already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They themselves said they didn't want to go, so the author sent them to school.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset that the kids aren't attending. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not forcing the kids to go. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are very young and already had a hard time at the viewings. Forcing them to attend another event, especially one that's emotionally draining, might not be the best idea. The author mentioned that the kids said they already said goodbye. Respecting the children's wishes here is important. Also, the author is prioritizing their education with the tests, but school attendance is mandatory unless there's a valid reason. However, the burial is a family event, but it's on a school day. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author is the parent making the decision, so they might be considering what's best for the kids. There's also the fact that the kids are in a difficult situation with a divorce, so the author might be trying to shield them from further conflict or stress. \n\nAnother angle is the cultural or family expectations. In some cultures, attending a burial is a must, but the author might be thinking about the kids' emotional state. Also, the kids are in school, which is a responsibility. The author probably thinks that attending school is more important than the burial for the kids at this point. \n\nI think the key points are the children's emotional well-being, their own expressed wishes, and the parent's responsibility to balance school and family obligations. The author isn't forcing the kids to attend, which they might not want. So, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
