Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether sending the kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial makes them the asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and there were viewings on Friday and a wake on Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day. The kids already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now, the burial is happening on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They themselves don't want to go, so the parent sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't there. \n\nThe key points here are the kids' well-being, the parent's decision based on the kids' wishes and school obligations, and the ex-MIL's reaction. \n\nFrom a child's perspective, attending multiple funerals might be overwhelming, especially if they're already upset. The parent considered the kids' emotional state and their school schedule. The kids said they had already said goodbye, so forcing them to attend might cause more distress. \n\nThe ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable because she might expect family to attend the burial, but the parent prioritized the children's needs. The parent isn't in a great relationship with their ex, but they had a close bond with the ex-FIL. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions based on their children's best interests. The kids' mental health and education are important factors here. The parent didn't force the kids to attend previously, and respecting their wishes now seems reasonable. \n\nThe parent also explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so they tried to communicate their reasoning. The ex-MIL being very upset is unfortunate, but the parent isn't obligated to satisfy the other family's expectations if it's not in the kids' best interest. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's decision seems justified. They're acting in the kids' best interest, respecting their wishes, and balancing school responsibilities. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
