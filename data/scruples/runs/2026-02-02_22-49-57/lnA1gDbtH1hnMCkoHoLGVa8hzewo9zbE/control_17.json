Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away, and the author is divorced from the kids' father. They had a close relationship with the grandfather, and the kids were present at the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They said they didn't want to go to the burial, so the author sent them to school instead.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset that the kids aren't attending the burial. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not forcing the kids to go. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the children. Six and nine are very young. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally difficult for them. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The kids are processing their first significant family loss. Forcing them to attend the burial might add more trauma, especially if they don't want to go. The author respected their wishes, which is important for their emotional well-being.\n\nSchooling is also a factor. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day. The kids have tests. Missing school for the burial could be seen as less important compared to their education, especially since the kids themselves don't feel the need to attend. The author made an effort by taking them to the viewings and the wake, which were more immediate and emotional parts of the process. The burial might be a more formal event with family members, which the kids might not need to attend, especially since the ex's family is going. \n\nThe ex-MIL's upset reaction is mentioned, but the author explains the kids' feelings. It's possible the ex-MIL expected the kids to be there, but the author prioritized the children's needs. The author loved their ex-FIL as a father, so maybe there's guilt involved, but the decision was based on the kids' emotional state and school obligations.\n\nAnother point is that the kids themselves said they didn't want to go. The author didn't force them, respecting their autonomy. That seems like a responsible approach. The burial is a smaller event with family, and the kids have already expressed their goodbyes. There's no indication that the author is neglecting their responsibilities to the kids or the family. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe some people would say that children should attend family funerals to learn about death and respect traditions. But given the kids' age and emotional state, plus their own school obligations, it's a close call. However, the author did what they could to involve the kids in the earlier events. The author's decision was made in the best interest of the children, so they're not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
