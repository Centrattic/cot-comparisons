Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The situation is about a parent deciding not to take their kids to a grandfather's burial because they had school tests, and the kids themselves said they didn't want to go. The other parent's mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. They're 6 and 9. That's pretty young, so attending a funeral might be overwhelming, especially if they were already upset at the viewings. The parent mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial is a more formal event, and it's a Monday with school tests. The kids themselves expressed not wanting to go, which seems important. The parent is prioritizing the kids' emotional well-being and their school schedule over the funeral. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but does the author have a responsibility to make the kids go? The parent is divorced from the kids' father, but the grandfather was important to them. However, the author's primary responsibility is to their children's needs. If the kids are too young to handle another emotional event and have tests, it might be reasonable to not force them. Also, the kids felt they had already said goodbye, so maybe they didn't need to attend the burial.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family obligation. But the parent is respecting the kids' wishes and their own judgment as a parent. The key factors here are the children's age, their emotional state, their own decision, and the parent's responsibility to balance their needs with family obligations. I think the parent made a reasonable choice, so the answer is B.\n"
