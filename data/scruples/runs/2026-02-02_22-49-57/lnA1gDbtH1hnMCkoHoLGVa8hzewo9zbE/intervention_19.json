Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of taking them to their grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake on Friday and Saturday, which were emotionally tough. Now, the burial is on Monday, and the kids didn't want to go. The author let them stay in school for tests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids had already been through a lot with the viewings and the wake. They were upset, crying, and it's their first family member's death. Forcing them to attend the burial might cause more trauma. The author asked them and they didn't want to go, so respecting their wishes seems important.\n\nThe ex-mother-in-law is upset, but the author's responsibility is to the children's emotional health. The kids have tests on Monday, which adds another layer\u2014education is important, but maybe not as critical as their mental state. The author loved the ex-FIL and was close, but the kids' feelings and needs are the primary concern here.\n\nAlso, the author is divorced and not on the best terms with the ex, but that's not the main issue. The key is the children's decision and the author's response. The author didn't force them, listened to their feelings, and prioritized their comfort. So, I think the author did the right thing. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
