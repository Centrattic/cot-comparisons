Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The key points are that they already took the kids to the viewings and wake on Friday and Saturday, which were emotionally tough for the kids. The burial is on a Monday, a school day, and the kids themselves didn't want to go, saying they'd already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author prioritized the kids' well-being and their school commitments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. They're 6 and 9, so they might not handle another emotionally draining event well. The author mentioned the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather at the viewings. Forcing them to go to the burial might cause more trauma. The kids expressed they were done, which is a valid consideration.\n\nAlso, school is in session. Missing school, especially with tests, could impact their education. The author has to balance family obligations with the children's current needs. There's also the fact that the ex-MIL is upset, but the author isn't responsible for her feelings in this case. The decision was made in the best interest of the kids, respecting their wishes and emotional state.\n\nCulturally, attending a burial is important for some, but it's not the only way to grieve. The kids were already involved in the earlier events. The author handled the situation sensitively by asking the kids and honoring their choice. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
