Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The situation is a bit complex. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now the burial is on a Monday, and they have tests. They don't want to attend again. The ex-mother-in-law is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. They've already been through the viewings, which were hard. Forcing them to go to another ceremony might add unnecessary stress, especially when they've already said goodbye. The kids are young; they might not understand the significance of the burial as much as the initial viewings. Their emotional state is a priority here.\n\nAlso, the parent is respecting the children's wishes. The kids expressed that they didn't want to go, so sending them to school instead seems reasonable. The parent isn't ignoring the situation but is making a decision based on the children's emotional needs. The ex-MIL's upset is a factor, but the parent's main responsibility is to the children's well-being.\n\nSchool obligations are also a consideration. Missing school for the burial might impact their education. The parent is balancing school and family events, choosing school when the kids themselves don't want to attend. It's a tough call, but it seems like the right choice given the circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their children's emotional health and respecting their wishes, which is the right approach.\n"
