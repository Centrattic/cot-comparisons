Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether sending the kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial was the right choice.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings and a wake, which were emotional for them. The author mentions that the kids were crying and it was tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and they have tests. The kids themselves didn't want to go to the burial, saying they already said goodbye. \n\nThe author's ex-mother-in-law is upset that the kids aren't attending. But the author is prioritizing the kids' well-being and their school responsibilities. The kids' emotional state is a big factor here. Forcing them to go might have been more traumatic, especially since they were already upset at the previous events. Also, the author is respecting the kids' wishes, which is important for their autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL might feel that the kids should have been present for the burial, but the author is acting in the best interest of the children. The author also took time off school for the viewings, so there was some presence there. The burial is smaller, and the kids don't want to go again. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're considering the kids' emotional needs. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They made a tough call to protect their children's emotional health, respecting their choices and the school schedule. The answer should be B.\n"
