Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending the kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The key points here are the ages of the children, their emotional state, and the family dynamics.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've already been to the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests. The author asked them and they declined, saying they'd already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids might find funerals stressful, especially after already attending viewings. The author mentions the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. It's important to prioritize their emotional health. Forcing them to attend might cause more trauma.\n\nAlso, the kids themselves expressed that they didn't want to go. Respecting their wishes is crucial. The author is divorced from the kids' father, but the kids chose not to attend, so the author should honor that choice. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable, but the children's feelings are more immediate here.\n\nThe fact that the burial is a small family event with the ex's relatives might mean that the ex-MIL expects the kids to be there for their father's family. However, the author's main responsibility is to the children's immediate needs. The kids have school commitments and tests, which are important for their education. Balancing school and emotional well-being is a tough call, but the author made a decision based on the kids' input and their emotional state.\n\nLegally and ethically, the parent has the right to make decisions in the child's best interest. The author isn't forcing the kids to attend another event they're already struggling with. The ex-MIL's upset is more about the family tradition or expectations, but the children's comfort is the priority here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They made a choice that prioritizes the children's emotional well-being and respects their wishes. The answer should be B.\n"
