Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether sending the kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial makes them the asshole. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the kids are young\u20146 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and they already missed school for the viewings and the wake. The author mentions that the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket, and the weekend was emotionally tough for them. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They themselves don't want to go. The author respects their wishes and sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't there for the burial.\n\nSo, the author's main points are about the children's well-being and their own wishes. They prioritized the kids' emotional health and school responsibilities over the burial. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author's decision seems to be based on the kids' needs. The children already attended the viewings and the wake, which were more involved, and now they're choosing not to go to the burial. The author isn't forcing them, which is probably the right approach considering the kids' age and emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL might feel that the burial is an important event and that the kids should be there to honor their grandfather. But the author has to balance family obligations with the children's immediate needs and their own well-being. The children have expressed not wanting to go, and the author is respecting their autonomy, which is a key aspect of parenting. Also, the tests on Monday might be important, and keeping them in school could be necessary for their education.\n\nIs there any cultural or family expectation that the kids must attend the burial? The author mentions they're from a different family now (divorced), so maybe the expectations differ. The author isn't the one forcing the ex-MIL to have a burial at that time. The kids are old enough to have some say in their participation, especially after the emotional toll of previous events. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the author seems to be making a compassionate decision based on their children's needs. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill the ex-MIL's wishes if it's not in the children's best interest. The key here is the children's well-being versus family expectations. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the kids' emotional state and respecting their wishes. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They made a difficult choice that prioritizes the children's needs and their expressed desires, which is appropriate for a parent.\n"
