Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is in the wrong. The parent and the ex are divorced and not on great terms. The kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go again. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent respected the kids' wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, which are young ages. They already attended two viewings and a wake, which were traumatic. Forcing them to attend another event might cause more distress. The parent asked them, and they said no, which shows the parent respected their feelings. \n\nNext, the parent's responsibility is to prioritize their children's emotional and educational needs. The tests on Monday are important, and the parent is making sure the kids are present for that. Also, the burial is a smaller event with just a few family members, so maybe it's less necessary for the kids to attend, especially if they're not emotionally ready.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable but not the parent's fault. The parent isn't obligated to cater to the ex-MIL's wishes if it's not in the kids' best interest. The key here is that the parent made a decision based on the children's input and their own judgment, which seems responsible. \n\nThere's no legal obligation for the parent to take the kids to the burial, especially since they're divorced. The primary concern is the children's well-being. The parent also loved the ex-FIL like a father, so it's a tough situation, but the choice was made to protect the kids. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
