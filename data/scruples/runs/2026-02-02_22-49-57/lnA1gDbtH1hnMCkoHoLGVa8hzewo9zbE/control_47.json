Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake on Friday and Saturday, which were emotional for them. The author mentions that the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket and were emotional. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the children have tests. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go to the burial, with the son saying they already said goodbye.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset that the kids aren't attending. The author had to explain the kids' wishes and the school tests. The key points here are the children's well-being and their own feelings about attending. The author is choosing to respect the children's wishes and their school obligations. \n\nForcing kids to attend might cause more trauma, especially if they're already upset. The author prioritized the children's emotional state and their educational responsibilities. The ex-MIL's upset feelings are understandable, but the parent's primary responsibility is to the children's needs. \n\nSo, considering the children's age, their emotional state, and their own decisions, the author seems to make the right choice. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
