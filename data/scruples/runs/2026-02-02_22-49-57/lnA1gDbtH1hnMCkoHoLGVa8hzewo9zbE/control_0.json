Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, so the parents aren't on the best terms. The kids are 6 and 9, so pretty young. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotional for them. The actual burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go again, so the author sent them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids might not handle multiple funerals well. The story mentions they were already upset at the viewings and wake. The author respected their wishes not to go to the burial. Forcing them could be traumatic. \n\nThen, the ex-mother-in-law was upset. But the author explained the situation. The kids themselves decided they'd already said goodbye. The father's family isn't going, so maybe the ex-MIL expected the kids to be there. But the author had to prioritize the kids' education and their emotional state. \n\nLegal and educational considerations: Schools have attendance policies. Missing school for a funeral might be excused, but the kids had tests. The author might have to balance between the emotional needs and the educational commitments. However, some schools might be understanding, but the parents here made a choice based on the kids' input.\n\nEthically, the parent's decision is to protect their children from further distress. The ex-MIL's disappointment is understandable but not necessarily the author's fault. The kids were involved in the decision, which is important. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author made a compassionate choice considering the children's emotional state and their own wishes.\n"
