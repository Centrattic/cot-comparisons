Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings and a wake, which were emotional. The kids said they had already said goodbye and didn't want to go to the burial. The author respected their wishes. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't there. But the author had to balance the kids' emotional well-being with the event. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests. The kids were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in the casket, so forcing them to go might cause more distress.\n\nThe author's decision seems to prioritize the children's comfort and their own needs at the time. They made an informed choice based on the kids' feelings. The ex-MIL's disappointment is understandable, but the author isn't the one who's wrong here. The kids' well-being is the main concern, so the answer should be B.\n"
