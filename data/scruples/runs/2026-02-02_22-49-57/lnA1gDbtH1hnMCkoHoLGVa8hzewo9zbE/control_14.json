Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and they already attended the viewings and wake. They were really upset, crying, especially since it's their first close family member to pass away. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves said they don't want to go to the burial. The mother decided to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mom is wrong. The key points here are the children's emotional well-being, their expressed wishes, and the practical aspect of school. The mother is prioritizing her kids' emotional state and their school obligations. The kids have already had their time to mourn, and forcing them to go might be traumatic. Also, the ex-MIL is upset, but the mother isn't in a great relationship with the ex, so maybe that's a complicating factor.\n\nI think the mother is making a responsible decision. She's respecting her children's feelings and their own wishes. The kids are young, and missing school for another funeral event when they already went to the viewings and wake might not be necessary. The fact that they have tests also adds to the school's importance. The mother is considering their needs and the kids' well-being first. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
