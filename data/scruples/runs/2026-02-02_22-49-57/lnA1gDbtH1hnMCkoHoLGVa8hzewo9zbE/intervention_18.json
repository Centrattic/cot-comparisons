Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent sending their kids to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9 years old, and this is their first family member they've known well who's passed. They already missed school for the viewings and the wake, and they were emotionally affected by seeing their grandfather in the casket.\n\nThe key points here are the children's well-being and their own decisions. The author mentions that the kids were upset at the viewings and the wake. Now, the burial is on a Monday when they have tests. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go. The author respects their children's wishes, which is a big point in their favor. \n\nGrandma is upset, but the parent is prioritizing the kids' emotional health and their school commitments. The kids have already been through a lot with the previous events. The author isn't forcing them to attend against their will, which shows consideration for their feelings. \n\nAlso, the parent is divorced from the kids' father, and the relationship with the ex is not great. The author loved the ex-FIL, but the kids might not have the same bond. The children's comfort and their own sense of closure seem to be the primary factors here. \n\nForcing the kids to attend the burial when they're not emotionally ready could do more harm. The parent made a decision based on the children's needs, not just the family's expectations. The author explains this clearly, which is why the ex-MIL is upset but maybe doesn't consider the kids' perspective. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they prioritized their children's emotional well-being and respected their wishes.\n"
