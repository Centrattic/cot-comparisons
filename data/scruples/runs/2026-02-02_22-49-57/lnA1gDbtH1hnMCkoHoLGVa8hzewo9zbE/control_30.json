Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already missed school on Friday for the viewings and the wake on Saturday. The kids were emotionally affected, crying, and it was their first experience with a close family member's death. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author asked them if they wanted to go, and they said no. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids might not understand the necessity of the burial in the same way adults do. They might be overwhelmed by the previous events. The author prioritized their children's emotional state and school obligations. The funeral is a family affair, but the kids are the author's primary responsibility.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author isn't responsible for the ex's family's feelings in this situation. The children's wishes were respected. The author explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so maybe the issue is the ex-MIL's expectations. The author isn't forcing the kids; they're making a decision based on the kids' needs. \n\nAlso, the burial is on a school day, and the kids have tests. Missing school could affect their education. The author is balancing emotional and educational needs. It's reasonable to send them to school if they don't want to attend. There's no indication the author was dismissive of the grandfather's passing; they attended the viewings and the wake. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a thoughtful decision based on their children's emotional state and their own judgment as a parent. The answer should be B.\n"
