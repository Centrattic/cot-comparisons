Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their kids didn't attend the grandfather's burial because they were at school, and the kids didn't want to go. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the kids were already at the viewings and the wake on Friday and Saturday. They were emotional and young, so maybe the author didn't want to push them further. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids had tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go, and they said no. The kids felt they already said goodbye, so maybe forcing them would be against their wishes.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author has to balance the kids' well-being with family obligations. The kids are only 6 and 9, so their emotional state is a big factor. The author might be prioritizing their children's comfort and their educational commitments. Forcing the kids to attend could cause more trauma, especially since they were already upset at the previous events. Also, the author's ex might have a strained relationship, so the author might not want to force them into a situation where they have to interact with the ex's family.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family tradition or a sign of respect. But given the kids' age, their expressed wishes, and the practicalities of school, the author's decision seems reasonable. The key points are the children's emotional state, their choice not to attend, and the practical reasons like school. The author isn't in the wrong for making the best decision for their kids.\n"
