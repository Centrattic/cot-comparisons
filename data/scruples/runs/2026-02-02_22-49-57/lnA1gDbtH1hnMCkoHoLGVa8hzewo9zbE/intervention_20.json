Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The story is that the kids are 6 and 9 years old, and they already attended the viewings and the wake. The funeral is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go. The ex-mother-in-law is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids at a funeral might be overwhelmed, especially if they're still processing the loss. The author mentions the kids had a hard time at the viewings and were emotional. The burial is another event that might be stressful for them. If the kids are saying they don't want to go and they've already said their goodbyes, forcing them might be more harmful than letting them stay in school.\n\nThen there's the school obligation. The tests are important, but maybe not as important as the child's mental health. Still, the author had to make a choice here. But since the kids themselves refused, maybe the author respected their wishes, which is a good parenting move.\n\nThe ex-mother-in-law's reaction is part of the conflict here. She's upset that the kids aren't attending. But the author's decision is based on the kids' well-being and their own wishes. The author explains that the kids felt they'd already said goodbye. The ex-MIL might feel slighted, but the children's emotional state is a priority in parenting decisions, especially when they express their own preferences.\n\nAnother angle: the author is the parent, so they have the final say in what's best for their children. Even if the ex-MIL is upset, the parent's decision to prioritize the kids' comfort and school obligations over attending the burial isn't necessarily wrong. The kids are in a sensitive age where they're dealing with grief, and the parent is trying to balance their needs with practical considerations.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the burial is a cultural or family tradition that the kids should attend. But the author's ex is involved, and they're not on the best terms. The ex's family might expect the kids to be there, but the author isn't under any obligation to accommodate that unless it's part of legal custody arrangements. Since the kids are with the author, the decision is theirs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a tough call based on their children's needs and their own judgment as a parent. The answer should be B.\n"
