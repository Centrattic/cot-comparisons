Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids are 6 and 9, they were already at the viewings and wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The funeral is on Monday, a school day, and the kids have tests. The author let them go to school instead of the burial.\n\nHmm. First, the kids were already at the earlier events. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The kids are young, so maybe the burial might be too much for them. The author asked if they wanted to go, and they said no. So the decision wasn't forced upon them. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author had to balance the kids' well-being and school obligations.\n\nI think it's important to consider the children's emotional state. They already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotional. The burial might be another traumatic event. The author made the choice based on the kids' own wishes and their school schedule. Also, the kids are in a new school or maybe dealing with tests, which are important for them. The ex-MIL might feel it's important for the kids to be there, but the author's priority was the children's comfort and their immediate needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
