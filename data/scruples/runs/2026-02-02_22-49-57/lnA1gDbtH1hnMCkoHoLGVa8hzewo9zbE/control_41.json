Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, so there's some family tension already.\n\nFirst, the kids attended the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author let them stay home for the viewings but now the ex-MIL is upset they aren't at the burial. The kids themselves don't want to go, saying they already said goodbye.\n\nI need to consider the kids' emotional well-being. They were already upset during the viewings and wake. Making them attend the burial might be too traumatic, especially since they're young. The author is respecting the kids' wishes here. Also, the tests are important for the kids' education, and missing them could have academic consequences.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable from her perspective, but the author's priority is the children's emotional health. The grandfather was close to the author, but the kids are the ones who need support now. It's a balance between family obligations and the children's needs.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some families, attending the burial is a must, but the kids are small and have already been through the services. The author explained the situation, so maybe the ex-MIL is upset because of her own feelings, not the kids'. \n\nThe key points: the kids' wishes were respected, their well-being considered, and the author made a choice based on their emotional state and school commitments. I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
