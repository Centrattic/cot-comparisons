Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. The author is a parent who had already taken the kids to viewings and a wake, and the kids were very emotional. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They asked the kids, and they said they didn't want to go. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kids' well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, very young. They've already attended the viewings and wake, which were tough for them. The parents are divorced, but the author is the custodial parent here. The ex-MIL is upset, but the kids' emotional state is a priority. Forcing kids to attend a burial when they don't want to might traumatize them more. The author respected the kids' wishes, which seems like a good parenting decision. \n\nAlso, the burial is on a school day with tests. The author had to balance school commitments with the funeral. The grandfather was a Veteran, but the burial is happening later because of the cemetery's schedule. The kids have already said goodbye, so the author didn't push them further. \n\nIn terms of cultural or family expectations, maybe some might think the kids should attend, but the author's decision seems to prioritize the children's emotional health. The ex-MIL's reaction is valid, but the author is the parent, so the decision rests with them. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
