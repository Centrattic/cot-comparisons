Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves the children being present at viewings and a wake, which were emotionally hard for them. The kids decided they didn't want to go to the burial, especially since they have tests at school. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. They already attended the viewings and were upset. Making them go to another event might be traumatic. The kids themselves expressed they didn't want to go, so respecting their choice seems important. Also, the burial is on a school day with exams, which adds a practical consideration. \n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is part of the conflict. However, the children's emotional state should take precedence. The author explained the situation, and while the ex-MIL is upset, the decision is about the kids' needs. \n\nLegally and ethically, the parent has the right to make decisions based on the child's best interest. Since the kids are young and have already grieved, sending them to school instead of the burial doesn't seem wrong. The parent isn't forcing them to attend something they don't want to. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They prioritized the children's emotional health and respected their wishes.\n"
