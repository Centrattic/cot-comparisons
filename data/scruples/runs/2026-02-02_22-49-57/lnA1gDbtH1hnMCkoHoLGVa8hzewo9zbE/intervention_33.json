Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids missed school on Friday for viewings, but had tests on Monday. They didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, parents are responsible for their children's education, and school attendance is usually mandatory unless there's a valid excuse. Since the kids had tests, missing school could be a problem. But the parent already took them to viewings on Friday. Now, the burial is on Monday, and the kids don't want to go. The parent respected their wishes.\n\nEmotionally, the kids are young (6 and 9) and had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. They were already emotionally affected. Forcing them to attend another service might cause more trauma. The parent's decision to prioritize their children's emotional well-being seems justified.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because they expected the kids to attend, but the parent isn't the ex's spouse. The ex is the one who's divorced and not in great terms with the current parent. The parent has the right to make decisions in the children's best interest, even if others are upset.\n\nCulturally, there might be expectations around attending funerals, but the kids are minors. Their needs come first. The parent explained the situation, and the kids themselves didn't want to go. The parent isn't forcing them, so there's no coercion here. \n\nConsidering all these points, the parent isn't in the wrong. They made a compassionate choice for their children's well-being, and the legal aspects of school attendance support their decision. So the answer should be B.\n"
