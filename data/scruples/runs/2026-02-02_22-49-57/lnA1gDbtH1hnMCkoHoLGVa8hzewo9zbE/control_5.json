Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending their kids to their grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old, and they already attended the viewings and a wake. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They chose not to go, and the author sent them to school instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kids' well-being. They found the viewings difficult, were emotional, and the author is respecting their wishes. It's important for children to have their feelings validated, especially after a loss. The author is prioritizing their children's emotional state over attending another event.\n\nNext, the school aspect. The kids have tests that day, and the burial is on a school day. The author might be balancing school responsibilities with family obligations. However, if the school allows for absences for family events, maybe there's a conflict. But the author mentions that the kids already attended the viewings and wake, so maybe the burial isn't as necessary for the kids.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author's decision is based on the kids' own choice. The kids said they already said goodbye, so forcing them to attend might cause more distress. The author is acting in the children's best interest, respecting their autonomy in a way that's appropriate for their age.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation that children should attend burials? That might vary, but the key here is the children's well-being. The author has already allowed them to participate in earlier events, which might be sufficient for their family's traditions.\n\nAlso, the author is divorced from the ex, and the relationship isn't great. The ex-MIL's upset might be more about her own feelings rather than the kids' needs. The author isn't in a position to please everyone, especially given the existing family dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made a decision that prioritized her children's emotional health and their own wishes, considering their age and the circumstances. Forcing them to attend could have been harmful. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
