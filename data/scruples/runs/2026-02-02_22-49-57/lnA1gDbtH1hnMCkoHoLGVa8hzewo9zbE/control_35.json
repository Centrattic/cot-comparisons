Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9, and they already had viewings and a wake. They were emotional and had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and they have tests. The kids said they didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids dealing with grief can be traumatic. They were upset at the viewings, so forcing them to go to the burial might be too much. The parent respected the kids' wishes, which is important. Parents usually should support their children's emotional needs.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the parent is the one making the decision. The kids are with the parent, so it's their choice. The parent explained the situation, so maybe the ex-MIL is just disappointed but the parent isn't wrong. Also, the burial is a small family event with the ex's family, so maybe the kids's presence isn't mandatory. The parent prioritized the kids' comfort and their school responsibilities. That seems reasonable. So, answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
