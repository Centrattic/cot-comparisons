Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The author mentions that the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket, and the weekend was emotionally tough for them. So, maybe the kids were already traumatized or overwhelmed by the earlier events. Now, the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids had tests. The author asked if they wanted to go, and they declined. The ex-MIL is upset that the kids aren't attending the burial.\n\nI need to consider the children's well-being. At that age, attending a funeral can be very stressful, especially if they're already struggling with the previous events. The author might be prioritizing the kids' emotional health and their school obligations. On the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the burial is a significant event, and maybe she expected the kids to be there. But the kids themselves didn't want to go after the initial events. The parent is respecting the kids' wishes here. \n\nAlso, the fact that the parents are divorced and not on the best terms might add complexity. The author might not want to create more stress for the children in an already difficult situation. Plus, the burial is only a small handful of family members, so maybe it's not as large or public as the earlier services. \n\nSchool tests on a Monday might be important, but I'm not sure if that's the main factor. The key is the kids' emotional state. Forcing them to attend could cause more harm. The parent explained the situation to the ex-MIL and the kids, so it's not like they're hiding things. \n\nIn terms of community standards, some might say that attending the burial is important for closure, but others would argue that the kids' feelings and well-being should come first. The author isn't forcing the kids to be there, and they've already had time to grieve. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're making a decision based on their children's needs and respecting their wishes. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but not necessarily the parent's fault if they acted in the kids' best interest.\n"
