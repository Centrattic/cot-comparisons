It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the man found out the child his pregnant girlfriend is carrying isn't his. He kicked her out of his house, and now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The couple was together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading him to financially support them. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nHe's being criticized for not providing a home for the child. But here's the thing: paternity is a big deal. If he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he went through a lot\u2014suspecting cheating, the breakup, then the betrayal when cheating was confirmed. The cheating part is important because it adds to the sense of betrayal. If she cheated, the child isn't his, and he's not responsible for supporting someone else's child. \n\nBut wait, maybe he feels responsible because he thought the child was his. However, once the test came back negative, that responsibility technically isn't his. The legal and ethical obligation to support a child usually falls on the biological parents. Unless he's adopted the child or legally committed to being the father, he's not obligated. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once he got involved emotionally and allowed her to stay, he might have a moral obligation to help, especially if the child is in a vulnerable situation. But he had a condition for the paternity test, which she agreed to. So he tried to confirm the truth. Once he found out it wasn't his, he felt justified in asking her to leave. \n\nHe also mentions that her parents are problematic (smoking), but after she moved out, she's staying with a friend. So maybe she has other support. The friends are telling him to take her back, but he's struggling with his emotions. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong because he's not the father. Emotionally, it's a tough spot. But does that make him in the wrong? If he's not the father, he's not obligated to provide a home. The cheating adds to the betrayal, so he might feel justified in cutting ties. However, some might say that regardless of the cheating, he's still responsible for the mother's well-being. But again, if he's not the father, it's not his responsibility. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's under no obligation to support someone else's child, especially after discovering the betrayal through cheating and the paternity test.\n"
