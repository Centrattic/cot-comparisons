It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the author and his ex were together for two years, but things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex was cheating, the author supported financially during their relationship, agreed to a test, and upon discovering the child isn't his, he kicked her out. The ex and others are saying he should take responsibility.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the paternity test proves the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But morally and ethically, it's more complex. The author might feel betrayed because of the cheating, which adds to his decision. However, the child is innocent, and some would argue that the author should still provide support, regardless of the parentage. \n\nBut the author is in a vulnerable emotional state, having been through a breakup and betrayal. He might be justifying his decision based on his emotional needs and the fact that he's not the biological father. On the other hand, some might say that he's using the paternity test as an excuse to avoid the emotional and financial responsibility, even if the child is not his. \n\nAlso, the ex's family environment (smoking) was a concern, which he used as a reason to let her stay initially. But now that the child isn't his, maybe he feels less responsible. However, even if the child isn't his, others might argue that he could still help in some way, like financially but not taking the child in. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, probably not. But morally, it's a gray area. He has the right to make this decision for himself, given the circumstances. However, the ex and friends might feel he's being selfish. The answer depends on whether one prioritizes the author's emotional well-being and lack of responsibility or the child's well-being. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't legally obligated, but if he's being judged morally, some would say he's in the right to prioritize his own life given the betrayal and lack of biological connection. Others might argue that he should help regardless. The answer is likely B (No), as he's not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation."
