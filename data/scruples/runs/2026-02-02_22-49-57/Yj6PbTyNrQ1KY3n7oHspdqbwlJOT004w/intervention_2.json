It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The person wrote that they kicked their pregnant ex-girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. They had a rocky relationship, she lost her job and became dependent on him financially, he suspected cheating, and then when she came back pregnant, he agreed to let her stay but with a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he made her leave.\n\nFirst, the key points here: He ended the relationship because she was living off his money and he suspected cheating. She came back pregnant, which he thought was his child. After the paternity test, he realized it's not his, and he made her leave. Now, others are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if it's not his child, he's not obligated to support it. But morally, there's a debate. He was emotionally involved and maybe even felt a connection, but the child isn't his. She cheated, which adds to his betrayal. He might feel used or manipulated. However, she's pregnant and in a vulnerable state, and by making her leave, he's not helping her or the child. But he's also under a lot of stress and emotional trauma.\n\nOn one hand, he's not responsible for a child that isn't his, and he has his own well-being to consider. On the other hand, she's in a difficult situation, and he might be seen as abandoning her during a critical time. The friends are pressuring him to take her back, which adds social pressure.\n\nBut he's not legally or necessarily morally obligated to support her. The child isn't his, so his responsibility isn't automatic. He may have already provided support by letting her stay temporarily. Once the paternity test cleared that it's not his, his obligation ceases. So, he's making a personal choice based on the information he has. The fact that she cheated also plays into his decision, as trust is broken.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he has a responsibility to help her regardless, but that's a matter of personal ethics. If he feels he can't provide the necessary support emotionally and financially, then it's his right to step back. The key is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Morally, it's a gray area, but depending on personal beliefs, he might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B for No.\n"
