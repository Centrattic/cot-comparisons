It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant ex-girlfriend after suspecting she cheated. She came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he kicked her out. Now he's being criticized for not wanting to take care of the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the paternity test confirms the child isn't his, then legally, he isn't the father. So, he isn't obligated to support the child financially. However, there might be emotional or ethical obligations. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which can be both legal and moral.\n\nOn the moral side, the user is feeling conflicted. He had already broken up with her before the pregnancy, and then after the test, he felt betrayed again when the cheating was confirmed. He's under a lot of stress. The ex's friends are telling him he should help the child regardless. The debate is whether it's fair to expect him to care for a child that isn't his, especially after being cheated on and not being the biological father.\n\nI should think about societal expectations. Some might argue that even if you aren't the biological father, you have a responsibility if you were involved in the pregnancy. Others might say that after the relationship has ended and the paternity is confirmed as not being his, he's not responsible. The fact that he was financially supporting her before the breakup might complicate things, but once the test shows he's not the father, maybe the obligation ends.\n\nAlso, the ex's behavior is a factor. She lost her job, didn't look for work, and he had to support her. Then she came back with the pregnancy, which he wanted to confirm. The cheating adds to the betrayal. So, his decision to leave her after the test might be seen as a way to protect himself from further emotional harm.\n\nBut there's the argument about the child's well-being. The author's home was a \"healthier place\" because her mother smokes. However, after the test, he's no longer the father. The ex is now staying with a friend to avoid the smoke, so the child is in a different environment. The author might be right in not wanting to be involved if he's not the father, especially given the circumstances of the breakup and cheating.\n\nAnother point is that the author didn't know about the pregnancy when they first broke up. If he had known then, maybe the situation would have been different. But the ex waited until after the breakup to inform him. Maybe that's part of the issue. Also, the paternity test was done under the agreement he had with her, so there's no deceit there. She agreed to the test, so the result is clear.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone is not the biological parent and the relationship has ended, the obligation isn't automatic. However, if he had been financially supporting her before the test, there might be a sense of responsibility. But once the test is done and he's not the father, that could be a reason to distance himself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision to kick her out after the paternity test is negative might be justified. He had a right to request the test, and upon learning the child isn't his, he can choose to not be involved. The cheating and the previous financial burden are also factors. Therefore, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
