It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky towards the end because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was supporting her. He also suspected she was cheating, and they broke up, with her leaving to stay with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. They agreed. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now, she's with a friend but others are criticizing him for not helping the child.\n\nSo the main points here are: the author initially supported her when he thought the child was his, but after the paternity test said it wasn't, he kicked her out. The ex's mom smokes heavily, so he wanted to protect the child from that. The ex and others are saying he should take responsibility.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the paternity test is confirmed, he isn't the biological father, so he isn't legally obligated to support the child. But there's the emotional and ethical angle. He had assumed paternity, which might have led her to believe he was involved. But once the test proved otherwise, his responsibility as a non-biological parent could be questioned, especially if he didn't intend to be a co-parent from the start. \n\nThe ex's actions: she cheated, and she was unemployed and relying on him financially. Then she returned to his home, possibly with the intent of making him responsible. He did agree to let her stay on the condition of a test, which he followed through. Once the test showed it wasn't his, he ended the arrangement. \n\nOthers are telling him to take responsibility, but if he isn't the biological father and the relationship was already broken, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he had been trying to be a supportive partner and then changed his mind after the test, that could be seen as abandoning the child. Also, the ex might be seeking support from him, even if he's not the father, since they were in a relationship and he might have had a role in her life. \n\nBut the key here is the paternity test. If the child isn't his, legally and biologically, he isn't the father. If he's not the biological parent, then he's not required to support the child. However, some might argue that if he was in a relationship with the mother and assumed the role of a partner, he might have a moral obligation to help. But others might argue that the woman is responsible for her own and the child's well-being, especially if she knew he wasn't the father. \n\nIn the post, he mentions that the mutual friends are saying he's a bad person for not wanting the child in his home. But if the child isn't his, and the relationship was already over due to her cheating and financial issues, then his decision might be justified. He was in a difficult position, emotionally raw, and the paternity test changed things. \n\nHowever, there's a possibility that the ex might have used the pregnancy as a way to maintain a connection or get support. If the author wasn't ready to accept the situation and felt betrayed, then his reaction is understandable. But maybe there could have been a more compassionate approach, like helping her find another place instead of just kicking her out. \n\nThe crux here is whether the author is obligated to support a child that's not his. Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's more complex. If he had agreed to be a co-parent, then maybe. But since the test showed he's not the father, and the relationship was already over, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he had been supportive and then abruptly changed his mind, that could be seen as harsh. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the paternity test and the intent of both parties. The author acted based on the test results, which confirmed his fears. The ex might have other reasons, but the author isn't the biological father. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
