It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after a paternity test revealed the child isn't his. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider various angles.\n\nFirst, the timeline: the couple was together for two years but things got rocky when the ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading the author to break up and move out. Then the ex comes back saying she's pregnant, and they agree to a paternity test. Once the test comes back negative, the author kicks her out, leading to mutual friends criticizing him.\n\nLegally, if the author isn't the biological father, he isn't obligated to provide support. But there's a social and ethical component here. The ex is pregnant, not working, and possibly vulnerable. The author might feel betrayed because she cheated, which could influence his decision. However, the ex's friends are arguing he should help, emphasizing the child's well-being.\n\nEmotionally, the author is raw and dealing with betrayal. He might be justified in needing space, but the ex is in a precarious position. The author allowed her to stay temporarily but set a condition for the test. Once that condition was met and the result was negative, he felt it was time to end the arrangement. \n\nBut consider the unborn child's welfare. Even if the author isn't the father, the child might still need support. The ex's living conditions (smoking parents) are bad, and the author's home might be a safer place. However, the author isn't legally responsible, so he's not in the wrong for not taking responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being cold-hearted, not considering the child's needs. But the author has his own emotional state to manage. The key points are consent to the test, the result, and the decision made post-result. The author isn't in the wrong legally, and ethically, it's a tough call, but he's not obligated. So the answer might be B.\n"
