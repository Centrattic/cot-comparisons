It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author were together for two years but had a rocky relationship, especially when she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant and wanted to stay with him. He agreed but insisted on a paternity test. The test showed he's not the father, so he told her to leave.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether he's in the wrong for not allowing her to stay after the paternity test. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if he's not the father, he has no obligation to support the child. However, there's the moral angle. Even if he's not the father, the woman is pregnant and might need support. But he's already going through emotional turmoil, and she cheated on him. That's a significant betrayal.\n\nOn one hand, the author is reacting to betrayal and the stress of the situation, which could justify his decision. On the other hand, the woman might be in a vulnerable position, and cutting her off could leave her without support. But since the child isn't his, he's not legally bound to help, and his emotional well-being is also a factor.\n\nThe author's friends are telling him he's a terrible person, but maybe they don't see the full picture of the cheating and the financial strain. The key here is consent and the agreed-upon paternity test. Since she was happy to get the test and knew the consequences, he's not acting unfairly by following through. He's not responsible for the child, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
