It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author and his ex had a two-year relationship. Things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, making him support them financially. He suspected cheating and broke up. She moved in with her parents but then came back pregnant. He agreed to let her stay, provided they get a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, the paternity test result is crucial. If the child isn't his, he's not legally or morally obligated to take care of it. But the ex might be trying to get support from him, which he can refuse if the test proves it's not his. However, there's an emotional aspect here. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of the test. Once the test failed, he felt betrayed again, especially if cheating was confirmed as well. That betrayal might justify his reaction, but does it?\n\nThe key legal point is whether he has any responsibility towards the child. If the DNA test is conclusive, he's not the father. Legally, he's not responsible. However, the ex might be using the child as a way to keep him involved or for financial support. Emotionally, he's hurting, and the mutual friends' pressure might be adding to his guilt.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Ethically, if he's not the father, he's not obligated to provide a home. However, the unborn child is innocent. But the mother made the choice to have the child and then seek support from someone who isn't the father. The author might be in a tough spot where he's protecting himself from further emotional and financial strain. On the other hand, the ex is in a vulnerable position, and he might be seen as abandoning her when she needs help.\n\nBut since the child isn't his, his responsibility is to himself. The friends might be conflating his responsibility to the child with his relationship with the ex. The answer hinges on whether the author is morally obligated to help an unborn child not his. Legally, he's not, but morally, it's complex. However, given the circumstances where he was deceived and the test confirmed he's not the father, he's justified in prioritizing his own well-being. So, I think the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
