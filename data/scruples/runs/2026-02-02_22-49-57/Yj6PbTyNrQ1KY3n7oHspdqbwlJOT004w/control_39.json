It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple was together for two years, but the last months were rocky. The girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading to the author providing financial support. He suspected she was cheating, which eventually led to the breakup. She went to live with her parents. Then, later, she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he agrees to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. They do the test, find out the child isn't his, and he tells her to leave. Now people are saying he's a terrible person for not letting her stay, even though her parents' house has issues.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author initially agreed to let her stay to protect the unborn child from his parents' smoking. But after the paternity test confirmed the child isn't his, he no longer wants to support her. The question is whether he was wrong to do that.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a man isn't automatically responsible for a child unless he's married or legally acknowledges paternity. If the test proves he's not the father, he might not have legal obligations. However, the girlfriend might still be seeking support, but if the author isn't the biological father, he's not obligated to provide it unless he's willfully agreed to be involved in some way.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The author might feel he was used or deceived. If the pregnancy was a way for her to get him back, that's a betrayal. On the other hand, she might be in a vulnerable position, and the author is choosing not to help. The text mentions that mutual friends are criticizing him, saying he should take care of the kid. The author is feeling emotionally raw and conflicted.\n\nAlso, the author had a condition for the paternity test, which she agreed to. So, when the test came back negative, he was probably expecting her to leave once that condition was met. The problem is her friends and others are now pressuring him to stay involved even though he's not the father. The author might be feeling that by not being the father, he's not responsible and wants to focus on his own recovery from the breakup and infidelity.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the child's well-being. If the author is capable of providing a better environment than her parents, some might argue he has a moral duty to help. However, if the author was not the father, his responsibility isn't automatic. The key here is whether the author had any prior commitment to support the child regardless of paternity. If the arrangement was conditional on the test, then he's not wrong for ending it when the condition wasn't met.\n\nAnother angle: the author's emotional state. He's been through a lot, dealing with suspected cheating, actual cheating, and the stress of supporting someone else. It's possible he's overwhelmed and doesn't want to take on the responsibility of a child he didn't know he was going to have. That's a personal choice, but does that make him an asshole? It depends on the circumstances. If he genuinely believed it was his child and then discovered it wasn't, it's a big shock and maybe he's in pain and trying to protect himself.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, even if he's not the father, if she's in a bad situation (like her parents' smoking), maybe he should still offer support. However, the author might not feel responsible since he wasn't the one who caused her pregnancy. Also, if she was using the pregnancy to manipulate him into staying, that's a red flag. The fact that she was cheating is a significant factor here. If she was unfaithful, he's justified in not wanting to be involved with the resulting child from that infidelity.\n\nI need to check if there's any obligation beyond the legal. If the author is in a country where a man is considered the legal father even without a test, but here he did a test and it's not his, then legally he's off the hook. Ethically, some might argue that if he's financially stable, he should help, but others might say he's not responsible for someone else's child, especially after being cheated on.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He had a condition, which was met, and he's not the biological father. The emotional turmoil and betrayal also play a role in his decision. The key is that the paternity test was part of the agreement, and she agreed to it. If she expected him to support her regardless of the test results, she might be at fault for not being honest from the start. But the author made clear that the test was a requirement, so once it was done and negative, he's justified in ending the arrangement.\n"
