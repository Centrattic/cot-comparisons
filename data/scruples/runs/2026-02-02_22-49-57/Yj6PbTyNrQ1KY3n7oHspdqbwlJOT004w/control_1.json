It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple was together for two years but had a rocky end when the ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on the author's financial support. The author suspected cheating and eventually broke up, leading the ex to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nThe author is now being criticized by friends and others for being a bad person for not supporting the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal, moral, and emotional aspects. Legally, in many places, a non-biological father isn't automatically responsible for the child unless he's been recognized as the legal father. So maybe the author isn't legally obligated. \n\nMoral-wise, it's tricky. The author was already under stress from the breakup, financial strain, and possible betrayal. He had agreed to support the child upon the assumption it was his, but once the paternity test cleared that, he felt relieved and didn't want to take on the responsibility anymore. However, the ex is still pregnant and vulnerable, and others argue that he should help regardless. \n\nThe author might feel he's not responsible, but others may see him as abandoning someone in need. The ex's friends might be criticizing him for not stepping up, even if he's not the father. \n\nAlso, the author allowed her to stay temporarily to avoid the ex's parents smoking around the baby. But after the test, he no longer wants her there. Is that selfish? The unborn child's well-being is a concern\u2014does the author have a duty to ensure the ex is in a safe place, regardless of paternity?\n\nThere's a balance between personal boundaries and societal expectations. The author might be in a difficult emotional state, but the ex is still in a vulnerable position. However, he was never the biological father, so his obligation is unclear. \n\nI think the key points are: Did he have a prior commitment to support her during pregnancy, and does his current refusal make him wrong? If he only agreed to support if the child was his, then after the test, his responsibility might end. But if he's being asked to help even after knowing it's not his, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because he wasn't the biological father and the commitment was based on that assumption. However, there's a moral argument about helping someone in need, but legally and based on the information given, he's not obligated. So the answer is B (No).\n"
