It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. So, first, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author was in a two-year relationship with his ex, but it got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, broke up with her, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, he's being criticized by friends and her friends for not supporting the child, even though he's emotionally raw from the betrayal and the situation.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's emotional state, the cheating, financial responsibility, and the sudden change in paternity. Legally, in many places, a man isn't a legal father just because he's in a relationship with the mother. So if the child isn't his, he might not have a legal obligation. However, morally, the question is trickier. The author is being accused of being a \"terrible person\" for not helping an \"innocent child.\" But the child's father, if known, would presumably be the one responsible. The author isn't the father, so maybe he's not obligated to support someone else's child.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of the woman's situation. She's pregnant, and the author initially agreed to let her stay to protect the child from her mother's smoking. Now that the child isn't his, he's sending her back to her parents, which she's avoiding because of the smoking. So maybe the author is cutting off support without considering her well-being. However, he's justified in not wanting to support another man's child, especially after betrayal.\n\nThe author's friends are pressuring him to take her back. But he's struggling with his emotions. He's not legally responsible, but morally, is he in the wrong for not providing a home? If the woman isn't taking care of herself and the child is at risk (from smoking), maybe he should consider stepping in, even if the child isn't his. But that's a personal choice, not a legal one.\n\nThere's also the issue of consent and choice. The author agreed to a paternity test and was honest about the conditions. Once the test came back negative, he followed through. That seems fair. But if he knew he might not be the father, why did he agree to the arrangement? Maybe he wanted to be a father, but that's speculative.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are within his rights. However, the moral judgment depends on societal expectations. Some might say he's being selfish by not helping, while others agree that he's not responsible for someone else's child. The key is whether he's violating any laws or ethical standards beyond his own values.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not legally obligated, and he acted based on the paternity test result. However, there's a gray area where he could choose to help, but it's not his duty.\n"
