It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. They were in a 2-year relationship that ended because the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading to the guy supporting them both financially. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up. Then she came back pregnant, and he allowed her to stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test confirmed it's not his. He then asked her to leave, but her friends and mutual friends are calling him a bad person. He's struggling with his emotions, feeling betrayed, and is now being pressured to take care of the child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the guy is in the wrong for not wanting to support a child that isn't his, especially after the breakup and confirmed infidelity. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the paternity test proves he's not the biological father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. That's a key point. However, emotional and social aspects can complicate things. The user might be considering the moral implications\u2014like if he's being heartless by not helping despite the child's vulnerability. \n\nBut the situation also mentions that the couple had already broken up, and the cheating was confirmed. The decision to leave after the test might be seen as a reaction to betrayal. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought he would still support her regardless of the test results. \n\nI should consider whether the guy's actions are justified given the circumstances. The fact that he agreed to the test shows he was open to verifying. Once he found out it wasn't his, it's his right to reassess the situation. While empathy for the child is important, he isn't responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship ended. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the child's well-being. If the friend's home is a better environment than her parents', maybe he's being selfish. But the user says he's emotionally raw and might not be in a good place to support someone else. \n\nIn summary, legally and from a personal responsibility angle, he's not in the wrong. But morally, there could be arguments either way. The key is the paternity test result and the prior breakup. Since the user is not in the wrong, the answer should be B.\n"
