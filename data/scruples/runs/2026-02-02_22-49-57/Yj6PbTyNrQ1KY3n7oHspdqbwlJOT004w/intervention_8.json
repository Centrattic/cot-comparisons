It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship, broke up when she lost her job and he felt she wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating. She came back pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed the child wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. My job is to assess whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. Legally, if he's not the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally and morally, it's more complex. He did agree to support her during the uncertainty, but once the paternity was confirmed, he's not responsible. However, some might argue that he was emotionally invested and then rejected, leading to the backlash. The ex's friends are pressuring him to help despite the circumstances. \n\nHe's dealing with betrayal and emotional stress, which might influence his decision. But the core issue is whether he's obligated to help when he's not the biological father. Legally, no. Morally, some might say he's still the one who supported her during the pregnancy, but if he's not the father, he's not legally bound. However, if he had accepted the possibility of being the father and then changed his mind, that could be seen as a betrayal. But since the test cleared him, he's not responsible. \n\nThe ex's actions, like living off him and possibly cheating, add context. His decision to ask her to leave after the test might be justified. The friends' criticism might be based on sympathy for the child, but the author isn't the father. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
