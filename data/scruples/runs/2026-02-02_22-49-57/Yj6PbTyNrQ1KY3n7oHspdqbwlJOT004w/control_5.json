It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a rocky relationship, she lost her job, and he suspected cheating. He broke up with her, she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he kicks her out. Now, people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. Financially, he's not responsible. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating and then a breakup. He might feel betrayed, which adds to his decision. However, from a moral standpoint, some might argue that even if it's not his child, he's still in a position where the child might need support. But others might say he's not responsible and should focus on his own well-being.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. He allowed her to stay under the assumption of fatherhood, then upon learning it's not his, he chooses not to support it. Some might see this as selfish, but he has the right to his own living space. Also, he's been dealing with her joblessness, cheating, and the breakup. His emotional state is a factor. \n\nBut then, the child's well-being is a concern. However, legally and morally, if he's not the father, he's not required to help. The friends' pressure might be adding to his internal conflict. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He made a decision based on the paternity test result, which changed his responsibility. His mental health and past experiences justify his actions. However, there's a gray area, but the key is that he's not the biological father, so he's not obligated to support the child. Therefore, he isn't in the wrong.\n"
