It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and his ex had a rocky relationship, especially after she lost her job and relied on him financially. He suspected her of cheating, so he ended the relationship. She left to live with her parents but later came back when she found out she was pregnant, assuming it was his child. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed it wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, considering the paternity test result, he's relieved from the responsibility of fatherhood. His main concerns were financial and emotional support for his own child. Since the child isn't his, he might feel entitled to not support it. But there's also the fact that she cheated, which adds to his betrayal. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he has a moral obligation to help her regardless, given that she's pregnant and in a vulnerable state. The fact that her parents are smokers and her friend's home is better might be a reason to offer temporary shelter. But others might say that's her responsibility, not his, especially since he's not the father. \n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. He's gone through a lot\u2014infidelity, financial strain, and the emotional rollercoaster of impending fatherhood. His decision to ask her to leave could be seen as self-preservation after feeling betrayed. But others might say that abandoning her now, especially with a child, is harsh regardless of the circumstances.\n\nLegally, since he's not the father, he's not obligated to provide support. Morally, it's more ambiguous. Some might argue he should help her out of compassion, while others believe he's justified in prioritizing his own well-being. The mutual friends' opinions suggest societal pressure to act kindly, but personal feelings and circumstances also play a role.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex mix of legal rights, emotional trauma, and moral choices. The answer hinges on whether one values personal responsibility and self-care over societal expectations of charity.\n"
