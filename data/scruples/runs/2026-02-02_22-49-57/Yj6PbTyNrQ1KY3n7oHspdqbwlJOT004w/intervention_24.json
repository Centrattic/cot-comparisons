It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: the person found out their pregnant girlfriend's child isn't theirs, and they kicked her out. The author is wondering if they're at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex and author were together for two years, but the last months were rocky because she lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on the author financially. The author suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test came back negative, and the author asked her to leave again. Now, others are saying the author is bad for not helping the child.\n\nThe author is conflicted, feeling emotionally raw and considering if they should take responsibility. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLet me break this down. Legally, if the author hasn't legally acknowledged paternity, they might not have any legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, it's more complicated. The author was under the impression initially that the child was theirs, which led them to agree to let her stay again. Once the paternity test cleared that up, they no longer feel responsible. However, the author might have considered the emotional and financial implications, especially given the prior issues with the ex's behavior\u2014like not working and the suspected cheating. \n\nThe ex's actions (cheating, not contributing financially, possible lying about the child's paternity) could be seen as contributing factors. If the author believed they were the father and then found out they weren't, they might not feel obligated to provide support now. However, the child's well-being is a factor too. The author might have a moral obligation to ensure the child is safe and cared for, even if they aren't the biological parent. \n\nBut the author is also dealing with their own emotional state. They mention feeling raw and the betrayal from cheating. It's possible they're acting on those emotions rather than a rational decision. On the other hand, the author had already ended the relationship and the ex chose to come back under the pretense of an impending fatherhood, which could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe friends and others are pressuring the author to take her back, but the author is questioning their own responsibility. The key here might be whether the author is making a decision that's in the best interest of the child versus their own emotional needs. If the child is in a harmful environment (smoking, etc.), the author might feel conflicted about not providing an alternative. However, the author might not feel they can handle the added stress after the breakup and betrayal.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often an expectation to step up for the child, but legally and ethically, it's not always clear. The author's actions might not be in the wrong if they have no legal responsibility and the ex's actions were deceitful. However, if the author was the one who initially supported the child under the assumption of paternity, there might be some ethical responsibility to ensure the child's care, even if they aren't the father. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on the perspective. If the author is not legally responsible and the ex was deceptive, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if there's an expectation to help the child regardless of paternity, then the author could be seen as wrong. The author's own emotional state and prior issues with the ex are mitigating factors.\n"
