It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's ex was pregnant, but a paternity test revealed the child isn't his. He kicked her out after finding out. They had a two-year relationship that got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, living in his house without contributing. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left to her parents. Then she came back to tell him about the pregnancy, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed it's not his, he made her leave again. Now, others are saying he's a bad person for not supporting the unborn child, but he's conflicted because of the cheating and the stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main points are: 1) The author knew the child wasn't his and chose not to support it, 2) The ex was already staying with him under the condition that they do the test, and 3) The author's reasons for breaking up were financial and suspicion of cheating.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I should evaluate. Legally, in many places, a biological father has rights, but the author isn't the biological father. So he isn't obligated to support the child. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally, not legally. \n\nThe ex was in a position of staying in his house, and once the paternity was clear, he might feel justified in ending the relationship. But others argue that the child is innocent and should be helped regardless. The author might be experiencing a mix of betrayal and financial stress, which could explain his decision. However, the ex is now pregnant and in a vulnerable state. Kicking her out could affect the child's well-being if he is part of the support system.\n\nBut the author's responsibility is to his own well-being and financial stability. He had already broken up with her for valid reasons. The paternity test confirmed his fears, so he might feel that taking her back would mean supporting a child he's not responsible for. On the other hand, some might argue that even if the child isn't his, he's still in a position where he should help because of the existing relationship and the child's needs. \n\nThe key here is consent and the prearranged paternity test. Since she agreed to the test, the author might have thought he was being fair. But after the test, he still has to support his ex if he wants to maintain a moral stance. However, he's not obligated to do so. The mutual friends and others might be biased, thinking he should still help, but the author's emotional state and the confirmed cheating (as per his statement) are factors. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is responsible for supporting the child. Since he's not the biological father and already made it clear he wanted the test done, his decision to end the cohabitation might be seen as just. But some might say he should still help for other reasons, like the emotional bond or societal expectations. However, the test was an agreement, so once the result is out, he's not in the wrong for honoring that condition. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
