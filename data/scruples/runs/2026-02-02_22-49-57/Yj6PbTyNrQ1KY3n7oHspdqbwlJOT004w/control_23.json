It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author kicked his pregnant ex-girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, then she lost her job and they broke up. She moved back in because her mom smokes, and they agreed to a paternity test. When it came back negative, he asked her to leave. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the author isn't the biological father, he isn't obligated to support the child. But there might be social or moral expectations. In some places, if someone is presumed to be the father and then the paternity is disproven, they might not have legal responsibility. But maybe the ex is claiming he is the father, so he needs to confirm through the test.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal from cheating, which adds to the stress. The ex is using the child as a way to stay in his life or get support. The author might feel manipulated. However, the child is innocent, and the author might be avoiding responsibility even if he's not the father. But if the test proves he's not, then he's not legally responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is a vulnerable pregnant woman. The author could be seen as abandoning her during a tough time, even if he's not the father. The friends are pressuring him to help, which might make him feel guilty. But is he responsible? It's a grey area. \n\nMoral responsibility isn't always clear. If the author supported her financially while she was in his home, maybe he felt entitled to the paternity test to confirm his role. Once it's proven he's not the father, he might feel no obligation to help. However, others might argue that he should still help because he was involved in her life and contributed to the situation.\n\nThe key points are: cheating, financial support, paternity test result, and current support. The author's actions are a mix of personal betrayal and a desire to avoid responsibility, but the child's well-being is in question. If the ex is not taking care of herself (like smoking), maybe the author was trying to protect the child. But by kicking her out, he's leaving her to her parents, who smoke, which is bad for the child. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's debatable. He might be prioritizing his own emotional well-being over the child's, but he's also reacting to confirmed betrayal. The answer might depend on societal expectations. If the community expects him to help regardless of paternity, then he's in the wrong. But if he's not responsible once paternity is disproven, then he's not. The question is whether he's morally obligated beyond legal terms. Given the circumstances, I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because the paternity test cleared him, and he's not legally or necessarily morally responsible. But there's a strong argument for A if one believes in supporting those in need regardless of circumstances.\n"
