It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex had a two-year relationship. It got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Later, she returned saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are telling him he's being a bad person for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author allowed her back into his home under the condition of the test. Once the child isn't his, he no longer wants to support her. The question is about his moral responsibility. \n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally and socially, though, there's the angle of responsibility towards an unborn child. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which is a moral judgment. \n\nThe author's ex cheated, which is a betrayal. The author felt used, especially since he was supporting them financially. He might feel that he's not responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after the emotional trauma. On the other hand, the ex might be in a vulnerable position, and the author could be seen as abandoning her when she needs support.\n\nBut considering the facts: the author set a condition (paternity test) before allowing her back. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he followed through on that condition. The ex is now with a friend, not his parents (who smoke), so she's not in a bad environment anymore. The author is dealing with emotional turmoil and betrayal. \n\nThe mutual friends are pressuring him to take her back, arguing about the child's welfare. But the author's stance is that he doesn't want to be responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after the cheating and financial strain. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's complicated. The author isn't legally obligated to support the child, and he had the right to set boundaries. However, the social expectation might be that he should help regardless. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, so the answer would depend on whether his actions were justified.\n\nThe answer might be B (No), because he set clear terms and followed through. The responsibility for the child now lies with the mother and her family. The author isn't obligated to help, especially after the circumstances. The friends' opinions are influenced by emotions rather than the facts of the situation. The author has the right to prioritize his own emotional well-being.\n"
