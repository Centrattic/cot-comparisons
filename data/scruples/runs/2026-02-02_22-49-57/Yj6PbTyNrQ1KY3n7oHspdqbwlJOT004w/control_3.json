It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who kicked out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his is at fault. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation step by step. The user and his ex were together for two years. The relationship became rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading to him financially supporting both. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, so she went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay, but with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, they did the test, found out the baby wasn't his, and he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: he was in a relationship that ended, she was pregnant but the child isn't his, he agreed to support her under the condition of a paternity test, and after finding out the child isn't his, he wanted her to leave. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the user might feel he's not responsible for the child since it's not his. He had already been through emotional stress with the breakup and her possible cheating. He had a condition set for her staying, which she agreed to, and when that condition was met (the test), he followed through. However, others might argue that once he agreed to let her stay, he had a responsibility, even if the child isn't his. But legally, unless he's married or there's a legal obligation, he isn't responsible for another man's child. \n\nEmotionally, he's in a vulnerable state, and after the cheating and the breakup, the betrayal might have made him feel justified in cutting ties. On the other hand, some might see him as abandoning someone in a difficult situation. But she's an adult, and she's choosing to stay with friends instead of her parents. He's not forcing her to stay; he's giving her space. \n\nIt's also important to note that the paternity test was a mutual agreement. She agreed to the test, so she knew there was a possibility the child wasn't his. Therefore, the decision to leave after the test result is not necessarily unfair. However, some might criticize him for not offering support regardless of the test results. But he's not under any obligation to do so. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards B (the author isn't in the wrong) because he had conditions set, followed through after the test, and isn't legally responsible. However, others might argue from a moral perspective that he should help, but legally and ethically, it's not his responsibility. The key here is that the paternity test was a condition he set, and she agreed, so once that was resolved, he had the right to ask her to leave. The emotional aspect is complex, but he's not wrong for prioritizing his own well-being after the betrayal and stress.\n"
