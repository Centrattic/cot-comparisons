It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nSo, the author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship became rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, which led to the breakup, and she moved in with her parents. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, and it turned out the child isn't his. Then he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are telling him he's being a bad person for not letting the child stay.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether he was wrong to not support the child now that he knows it's not his. Let's break it down. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to provide support. But ethically, it's a bit more complex. He might be blamed for not showing compassion, especially to an unborn child. However, he also had valid reasons for the breakup\u2014her not working, possible cheating, and her parents smoking. He might feel it's unfair to take on the responsibility of a child that's not his, especially after such a stressful period.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The key points are: he agreed to the test, and after the result, he asked her to leave. Others are pressuring him to take her back. Is it fair to him? Well, he's not the father, so maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should still help because she's in a vulnerable state. But the author might feel he can't be a father to a child that's not his, especially after the betrayal. His emotional state is raw, so it's understandable he's not up to supporting the child.\n\nI should consider both legal and emotional aspects. Legally, he's not responsible. Emotionally, he's justified in his decision given the circumstances. The fact that he was willing to take a paternity test shows he tried to be fair. But others might still think he's heartless. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer leans towards B, No, because he's not the father and had reasons to end the relationship. But maybe there's a nuance I'm missing here, like if he should have known earlier or if there's an obligation beyond biological parenthood. But the scenario says he didn't know until the test, so he's not at fault for acting based on new information.\n"
