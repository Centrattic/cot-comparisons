It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author was in a two-year relationship that ended because the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't working, leading to financial strain. The author suspected infidelity, so he ended the relationship and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support the child once he found out it's not his. The people around them are saying he should take care of the child regardless. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. Paternity tests are definitive, so once he's confirmed it's not his, he isn't legally bound. Emotionally, though, it's complicated. The author was initially supportive, thinking it was his child, and then felt betrayed when the test revealed otherwise. He also mentions that she cheated, which adds to his feelings of betrayal.\n\nBut the question is about right or wrong. The author's reasons for ending the relationship earlier were financial and suspicion of cheating. Now, the woman is in a vulnerable position, pregnant, and he's refusing to help. However, he's not the biological father. The author is in a tough spot, dealing with emotional trauma from the relationship's end and the betrayal. \n\nThe friends are pressuring him to take her back, but he's questioning his own actions. The key here is whether he's morally obligated to take care of a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship ended. Since the child isn't his, he's not legally responsible, and there's no moral obligation if there's no prior agreement. However, some might argue that once a relationship is established, there's a moral duty even if the child isn't biologically his, but that's debatable. \n\nIn this case, the author made a conditional agreement to stay with the caveat of a paternity test. Once the test was done and the child isn't his, he's following through on his terms. The woman's friends are critical, but the author is prioritizing his emotional well-being after being betrayed and dealing with the stress. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he acted based on the truth revealed by the paternity test and his own terms. He can't be blamed for not wanting to support a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship was already broken off. However, there's a human aspect where he might feel conflicted, but legally and morally, there's no obligation. So the answer is B.\n"
