It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author had a girlfriend who was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay in his house after she said the baby was his, but after a paternity test showed it wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not supporting her and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The ex-girlfriend lost her job and was living with the author, which he had to support financially. They broke up because she wasn't looking for work and he suspected cheating. Then she came back claiming she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay so the baby wouldn't be exposed to her parents' smoking. They did a paternity test, and it turned out the child wasn't his. He then asked her to leave, and now others are criticizing him for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was under the impression he might be the father, allowed her to stay for the child's health, but after the test, he no longer wanted to be involved. The question is whether he's in the wrong for that decision.\n\nLegally, if the author isn't the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. However, morally, it's a different story. The author is being criticized for not helping an \"innocent child\" and the mother. On the other hand, he was emotionally affected by the betrayal and the situation. He might feel he's being taken advantage of, especially since she was living with him after the breakup and now he's being expected to support a child that isn't his.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Factors to consider: Did he have a right to expect the child to be his? Did he act responsibly by getting a paternity test? After knowing the child isn't his, is he obligated to help? The mother's actions (cheating, not working) might contribute to the author's feelings of betrayal and not wanting to be involved. However, the child is innocent here, and the author might have a moral duty to support the mother and child regardless of the circumstances.\n\nBut the author's decision to kick her out after the test could be seen as abandoning a pregnant woman and her unborn child. Even though he's not the father, he might still have a moral responsibility if he was the one who agreed to let her stay. However, he did agree under the condition of the paternity test, so maybe he's justified in leaving when the test didn't confirm his paternity.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once he took her in, he's responsible for the situation he created. The mother might not be in a position to support herself, and the author could be seen as abandoning her when she needs help. But the author is dealing with emotional trauma and betrayal, which is a valid reason for his decision.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were based on reasonable expectations and his right to withdraw support once the paternity was confirmed. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's more ambiguous. The question is whether the user is asking for a legal or moral assessment. The original question is about being in the wrong, which usually refers to moral responsibility.\n\nIn the context of \"Am I the asshole?\" forums, the community often looks at intent, actions, and consequences. The author's intent was to support the child if it was his, but once it wasn't, he withdrew. However, by taking her in, he might have committed to helping regardless. The mother's friends are criticizing him, but their perspective is that he should help regardless of paternity. The author's emotional state and betrayal are his reasons for leaving.\n\nIn the end, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because he wasn't the father and had the right to make that decision. However, some might argue that he should still help, making it a moral dilemma. But given the information, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), as he's not legally obligated and acted on the test result. However, others might say he's in the wrong (A) for not supporting a pregnant woman in need. This is tricky, but considering the paternity test and the author's reasons, the answer leans towards B.\n"
