It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he had a girlfriend who got pregnant, but when they did a paternity test, it turned out the kid isn't his. Then he kicked her out of his house. Now, he's wondering if he was wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the father's responsibility towards the child. If the child isn't his, does he have any obligation? Well, legally, if he isn't the biological father, then he's not legally responsible. But maybe there are other factors. The ex had a history of cheating, so maybe he felt betrayed. Also, during their relationship, she wasn't working and he was supporting her, which might have caused some financial stress. Then, after the breakup, she came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he let her back in with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed to that.\n\nNow, when the test came back negative, he made her leave. The friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping. So, the question is, is he wrong?\n\nOn one hand, he's not the biological father, so he's not obligated to take care of the child. Also, the relationship ended because she was cheating and not contributing financially. He might be justified in not wanting to support a child that isn't his, especially after the betrayal. Plus, he's emotionally raw and doesn't feel like he can handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, even if he isn't the biological father, he might have formed an emotional bond with the idea of being a father. Also, she's pregnant and vulnerable, and he might have a moral obligation to support her, even if it's not his child. Some people might argue that once you get involved in the pregnancy and agree to help, you have a responsibility regardless of the test results. \n\nBut legally, there's no obligation. However, social and moral views vary. Some might see his action as selfish, but others might see it as him protecting himself from further emotional and financial strain, especially given the cheating and previous issues. \n\nHe also mentioned that her parents smoke, so he allowed her to stay to protect the unborn child. Then, after the test, he kicked her out, which might be seen as a flip-flop. But his reason was that the child isn't his, so maybe he feels he can't be responsible. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If we go strictly by the facts: not his child, she cheated, he wasn't in a relationship anymore. So, not wrong. But maybe some would argue that once you're involved in the pregnancy, you should help regardless. But legally and ethically, it's a gray area. \n\nThe answer is probably B (No), because he isn't the father and has no legal obligation, and he's making a personal choice based on his own circumstances and the betrayal.\n"
