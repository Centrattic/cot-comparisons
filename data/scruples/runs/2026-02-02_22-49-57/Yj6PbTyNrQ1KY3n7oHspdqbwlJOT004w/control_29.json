It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, then broke up because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected cheating. After the breakup, she came back saying she's pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test shows she's not his, so he kicks her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Paternity is a big deal, and once the test proved he's not the father, there's no legal responsibility. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, possible cheating, financial strain, and now betrayal again. He was supporting her because he thought it was his child, but once that's proven wrong, it's not his duty anymore. \n\nBut there's the ethical angle. Even if it's not his child, is he responsible because he was involved in her life? Maybe. But he's not the legal father. People might argue he should help since he was part of her life, but he's not under any legal obligation. Also, she's with her parents, and he's not the one refusing her shelter; she has family. \n\nHe's also dealing with emotional turmoil. He might feel betrayed again, especially if she had an affair. The friends say he should take her back, but that's not his decision. He's choosing his own well-being here. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not legally or ethically. He's not the father, and he's not responsible for another man's child. He's making a choice to take care of himself after a difficult situation. The answer is B, No.\n"
