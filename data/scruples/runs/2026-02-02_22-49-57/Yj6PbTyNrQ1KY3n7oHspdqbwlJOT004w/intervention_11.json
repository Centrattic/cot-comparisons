It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They had a two-year relationship, which ended because she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay but with the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the child isn't his, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. He's not the biological father, so there's no legal responsibility towards the unborn child. However, he was in a relationship with the mother, so maybe there's emotional or moral expectations, but legally, he's off the hook.\n\nEmotionally, he felt betrayed because she cheated. That's a big deal. He had already ended the relationship due to her not working and possible infidelity. The situation was rocky, and now this paternity issue adds to the betrayal. He's been through a lot of stress and emotional turmoil. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex and others are saying he's being cruel to the unborn child. But if the child isn't his, he's not responsible for it. The mother is the one who needs to care for the child. He provided a place initially, but once the paternity was confirmed not to be his, he's not obligated to continue supporting them. \n\nHe also mentions that her mother smokes, which is a valid concern for the child's health. However, once the paternity is known, the responsibility shifts back to the mother. He can't be forced to take care of a child he didn't father, especially after the relationship ended.\n\nBut there's a social aspect here. If he's being judged by friends and others for not helping, maybe there's a cultural expectation of stepping up, but legally and morally, he's not required to. The mother is the primary caregiver here. He's allowed to set boundaries, especially after the betrayal and the stress he's been through.\n\nSo putting it all together, he isn't in the wrong. He followed through with the paternity test, which was a fair condition. Once it was clear he wasn't the father, ending the arrangement and asking her to leave is reasonable. He's not obligated to support a child that isn't his, and his emotional state is valid. The answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
