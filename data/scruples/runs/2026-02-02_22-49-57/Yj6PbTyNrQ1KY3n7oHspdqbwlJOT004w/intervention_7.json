It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after a paternity test showed he wasn't the father. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The ex and the author were together for two years. The relationship was rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, which he later confirmed. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test shows it's not his, so he kicks her out. Now, friends are saying he's being a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: cheating, financial strain, the paternity test, and the decision to leave her after the test. The author feels emotionally raw and conflicted.\n\nI need to determine if his actions were wrong. Legally, he's not obligated to support a child that isn't his. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. He had agreed to the test, and once he knew it wasn't his, he felt justified in leaving. But some might argue that because he was part of the situation initially, he has a moral responsibility.\n\nHowever, the ex cheated on him, which is a betrayal. He allowed her to stay under the condition of the test, so he wasn't being taken advantage of. Once the test cleared that it wasn't his, he felt no obligation. Friends are pressuring him to take her back, but he's already broken up with her. \n\nThe main question is whether he's obligated to support a child he's not the father of, especially after the trust was broken. Legally, no. Morally, some might say yes because he was involved, but others say no, since he wasn't the biological father. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, and I need to see if I agree.\n\nHe was upfront about the paternity test. She agreed. Once it was clear, he made a decision based on the new information. His friends are being judgmental, but he's prioritizing his own well-being after betrayal. So, I think he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
