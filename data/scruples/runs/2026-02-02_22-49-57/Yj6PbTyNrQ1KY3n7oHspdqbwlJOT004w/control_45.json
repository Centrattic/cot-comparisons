It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The couple was together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. The girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading the author to break up with her. She moved in with her parents, but then came back to say she's pregnant. The author agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had a prior agreement to do the paternity test, which he did. Once the result came back negative, he ended the living arrangement. The ex-girlfriend and others are criticizing him for not supporting the child. But the author is dealing with emotional trauma from the breakup and possible cheating, and feels he's not responsible for the child now.\n\nLegally, if the paternity test proves the author isn't the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, the situation is complex. The author might feel betrayed, especially if there was cheating involved. However, the ex-girlfriend is now in a vulnerable position, pregnant and without a stable home. The author's decision to end the living arrangement is his right, but there's a social expectation to support a child in need, regardless of paternity.\n\nBut the question is about right or wrong. The author isn't the biological father, so he's not legally bound. However, morally, some might argue he should help, especially if he was emotionally invested. Others might say he's justified in prioritizing his own well-being after betrayal and stress. The ex's friends labeling him as a \"terrible person\" adds pressure, but the author's feelings of being through emotional turmoil are valid.\n\nThe crux here is the balance between personal responsibility and moral obligation. Since the child isn't his, and he's already broken up, the author isn't in the wrong legally. Morally, it's a gray area. The decision to end the living arrangement is his choice, and he's not obligated to take care of the child. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
