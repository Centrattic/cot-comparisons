It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author found out the child isn't his. That's a big point. Legally, he isn't the father, so he doesn't have any legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, though, it's tricky because he was preparing to be a parent and then found out he's not. The ex is staying with him because her mom smokes, but she's already moved out after the paternity test. \n\nHe broke up with her earlier because she was jobless and he suspected cheating. Now, after the test, he doesn't want her to stay. His friends are telling him he should help, but he's feeling emotionally drained. The key here is whether he's morally obligated to help a child that isn't his, especially given the circumstances with the ex.\n\nI think legally, he's not responsible. Morally, some might say that once you're involved in someone's life and a child is involved, you should step up. But others might argue that he's not the father and has the right to his own emotional well-being. The ex cheated and was irresponsible with his money. He might feel justified in cutting ties. \n\nHowever, the child is innocent. But the author wasn't the father, so maybe he's not responsible. Still, some might argue that he created a situation where he led the ex to believe he was the father, and now has a moral duty. But if he didn't know until the test, maybe not. \n\nIn the end, he's not the legal father, and his emotional state is a factor. So, I think he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
