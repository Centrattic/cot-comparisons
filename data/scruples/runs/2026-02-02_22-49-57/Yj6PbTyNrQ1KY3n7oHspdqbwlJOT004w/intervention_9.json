It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who discovered that the child their ex-girlfriend is pregnant with isn't theirs and chose to kick her out. The author is questioning their actions, especially given the pressure from friends and others who think they should help. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and ex were already in a rocky relationship for the last few months before breaking up. The ex was not working, relying on the author financially. The author suspected cheating, which was later confirmed. The ex then came back, claiming pregnancy, and the author allowed her to stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test proved the child isn't his, leading the author to ask her to leave again.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is obligated to continue supporting the ex and the child even after discovering the child isn't his. Legally, if the author wasn't the father, he wouldn't have a legal responsibility to support the child. Emotionally and socially, there's pressure from friends and the ex's side to take care of them, but the author is struggling with their own emotional state and past betrayals.\n\nThe ex cheated, which is a significant factor. The author might feel betrayed not just once but in multiple ways\u2014being lied to about the child's paternity and the cheating. The author is also dealing with financial strain from the previous arrangement. It's possible that the author's decision is a mix of legal rights, emotional release from a harmful relationship, and self-preservation.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the unborn child's welfare. Some might argue that the author should still help, even if it's not his child, out of a sense of responsibility or compassion. But others might say that the author isn't obligated to support someone else's child, especially given the circumstances of the relationship ending due to cheating and the ex's previous behavior of not contributing financially.\n\nAnother angle is the ex's actions. She knew the child wasn't his but still came back expecting him to take care of her, which could be seen as manipulative or deceitful. The author might feel manipulated into staying by the false promise of fatherhood, which adds to his emotional turmoil.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's decision to ask her to leave is a personal one. Legally, he's not in the wrong since he's not the biological father. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of a failed relationship. The friends' pressure is there, but it's important to respect the author's autonomy in deciding his own living situation and responsibilities.\n\nSo, based on the legal aspect, emotional context, and the ex's potential deceit, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The decision to not continue supporting the ex and the child isn't necessarily unethical, especially when the author's well-being is considered. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
