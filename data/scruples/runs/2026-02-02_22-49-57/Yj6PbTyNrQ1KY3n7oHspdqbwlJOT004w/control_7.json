It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author had a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, who became pregnant. He let her move back in to avoid her smoking environment, but after a paternity test showed the child wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's wrong for not helping the child.\n\nFirst, the paternity issue is crucial. He thought the child was his, which is why he agreed to let her stay. Learning it's not his must have been a shock. Legally, if he wasn't the father, he isn't obligated to support the child. But there's a moral question here. \n\nHe's dealing with emotional fallout from a breakup, possible cheating, and financial strain. The ex was living off his support, and that's already a point of contention. Now, even if he feels responsible, the test cleared that. But others are pressuring him to help. \n\nThe ex's actions: she might have known the child wasn't his and still asked him to stay. That's betrayal. But the author's response is harsh\u2014kicking her out after the test. However, he's in a vulnerable emotional state. \n\nLegally, he's not responsible. Morally, it's tricky. He wasn't the father, and she's the mother. But the child's well-being is a factor. If he can provide a better home, does he have a duty? Or is he justified in stepping back after betrayal?\n\nHe's also dealing with his own mental health. The mutual friends might be right to question his decision, but his emotional state is valid. The key points are paternity, his mental health, and the ex's responsibility as the mother. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but there's a moral ambiguity. However, since he wasn't the father and the ex is the mother, the responsibility isn't on him. So the answer is B.\n"
