It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child wasn't his. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex was living with him, they had a rocky end, he suspected cheating, broke up. Then she came back pregnant, he let her stay but wanted a paternity test. The test showed he wasn't the father, so he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a terrible person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to consider the key points. Legally, if he's not the father, he has no obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he was already stressed from the breakup, possible cheating, financial strain. He was trying to avoid exposing the child to his ex's parents' smoking. But once the paternity was clear, his responsibility might be less.\n\nHowever, the ex is pregnant and vulnerable. Even if he's not the father, the child could still need support. But the author might not have a duty to provide that. The mutual friends think he should take her back, but that's more of a moral stance. The question is about being in the wrong, which can be legal or moral.\n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's more complex. He had a right to feel betrayed, and the financial support might not be his. But some might argue that the child is still in need. The author is emotionally raw, so his actions might be seen as self-preservation. But others might see it as abandoning someone in need. The answer depends on the perspective. Since the user asked for a choice between A and B, and the user thinks B (not wrong), I might lean towards B as well, considering the lack of legal obligation and the author's emotional state.\n"
