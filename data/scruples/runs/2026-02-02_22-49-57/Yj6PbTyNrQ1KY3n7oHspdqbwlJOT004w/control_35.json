It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. The ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on the author financially. The author suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant. He let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he made her leave again. Now friends are saying he's a terrible person for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author initially supported her staying because he wanted to protect the child from his ex's smoking. But after the paternity test, he no longer felt responsible. The question is about whether he's wrong for not taking care of the child. \n\nEthically, if the child isn't his, he's not legally obligated to support it. However, the ex is still pregnant and in a vulnerable state. The author might feel betrayed because she cheated, which adds to his emotional turmoil. But the friends are pressuring him to help, arguing about the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, he's not responsible for someone else's child. But morally, it's more complex. Did he commit to helping the child before the paternity was known? He allowed her to stay under the assumption he might be the father. Now that he's not, he's removing support. But if the child isn't his, maybe he's not responsible. However, if the ex is struggling, maybe he should still help, given the prior relationship.\n\nThe author's actions are based on the paternity result, which is factual. But the emotional aspect is significant. The ex's friends are saying he's a terrible person, which is a moral judgment. The question is whether he's wrong in this scenario. \n\nFrom a strict legal standpoint, he's not obligated. But socially and morally, there's a debate. If he had committed to supporting the child once he found out he was the father, but now that he isn't, he's removing support. However, if the child isn't his, he has no legal responsibility. The ex is still his ex, and she's responsible for her own child. \n\nBut maybe the author feels conflicted because he initially wanted to help. Now that the situation changed, he's walking away. However, given that he found out she cheated and the relationship was already broken, maybe it's reasonable for him to not take on that responsibility. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's acting based on factual information (not the father) and the prior issues in their relationship. But there's a counter-argument that once he started supporting her, he should continue for the child's sake regardless of paternity. But legally and factually, he's not the father, so he's not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
