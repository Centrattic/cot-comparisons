It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after a paternity test showed he wasn't the father. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author and his girlfriend were in a 2-year relationship, which ended because she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating, which he later confirmed. She came back when she found out she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. After the test showed he wasn't the father, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support them. But ethically, there's a debate. He had let her stay to avoid her exposure to her mother's smoking, which was a good intention. However, once he knew the child wasn't his, he felt it was too emotionally taxing and chose to leave.\n\nHe's facing criticism for not taking care of the unborn child. But he's also been through betrayal and emotional turmoil. The key points are consent for the paternity test, the agreement to stay under the condition of the test, and his right to his own emotional well-being. \n\nOn one hand, he provided a safe environment initially but isn't responsible for a child that isn't his. On the other hand, some might argue he should still help given the circumstances. However, legally and ethically, he's not obligated. The fact that he was upfront about the test and she agreed to it supports his position. His emotional state after betrayal is also a factor in his decision. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong because he wasn't the father and had the right to prioritize his well-being after the test results.\n"
