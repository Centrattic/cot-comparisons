It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the man and his ex had a two-year relationship. They broke up because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. She left to live with her parents. She later returns, claiming she's pregnant with his child. He lets her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he kicks her out. Now, she and others are saying he's wrong for not helping the child.\n\nThe key points here are consent, responsibility, and emotional state. The man agreed to stay with her only because he thought the child was his. Once he found out it wasn't his, he felt betrayed and decided to leave. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to provide support. However, morally, there's a debate here. Did he have a responsibility to step up even if it wasn't his child? \n\nHe mentions he felt emotionally raw and betrayed. His ex was cheating, which adds to the betrayal. Legally, paternity is a big deal because it affects custody and support. If the child isn't his, he doesn't have a legal duty. However, if he had previously agreed to be a parent, there might be some obligations. But in this case, the agreement was conditional on the paternity test. \n\nThe ex is now living with friends to avoid smoking, which he was concerned about. He provided a safe environment when he thought the child was his. Now that he knows it's not his, he's removing himself. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue he's being selfish by not helping the child in need, but others would say he's not responsible for someone else's child. However, if he had started providing care under the assumption it was his, there could be arguments about his responsibility continuing. But since the test proved otherwise, his responsibility might end there. \n\nThe mutual friends are pressuring him, but he's not in a legal obligation. He's also been through a lot emotionally. The question is whether he's wrong. Legally, no. Morally, it's more nuanced. If he's not the father, he's not at fault for leaving. But if he had committed to being a parent, maybe there's an expectation. However, since the commitment was conditional on the test, his action might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, he's not in the wrong, because the child isn't his and he had the right to change his stance upon discovering the truth. But there's a moral gray area here. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Morally, some might argue, but the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about right and wrong, not just opinion. Since he's not the father, he's not wrong for not taking responsibility for someone else's child.\n"
