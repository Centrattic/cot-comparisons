It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. Hmm. First, I need to break down the situation. \n\nSo, the man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky towards the end because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was financially supporting her. He suspected she was cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back, told him she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, found out it wasn't his, and he made her leave. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider the key points. \n\nFirst, the author suspected cheating and later it was confirmed. That's a betrayal. Also, the ex was financially dependent on him for a while. When she came back, he agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, so there was an understanding. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he felt justified in asking her to leave. \n\nBut then, others are criticizing him for not helping her and the child. The ex is staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. The author is feeling emotionally raw and conflicted. \n\nLegally, if he wasn't the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. The main ethical question is whether he's morally obligated to help her despite the betrayal. \n\nFrom his perspective, he had no intention of supporting a child he's not the father of. The ex knew the terms and agreed to the paternity test. After the results, he felt it was right to let her go. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even if he's not the father, he should still help because the woman is vulnerable. But others might say he's not responsible for someone else's child, especially after being cheated on. \n\nThe key here is the mutual agreement on the paternity test. She came to him with the pregnancy, and he conditionally agreed to help. Once the test cleared him, he's not obligated. The emotional turmoil he's under is also a factor. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He followed through on the agreement and isn't responsible for supporting a child that isn't his. The answer should be B.\n"
