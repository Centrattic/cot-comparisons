It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after a paternity test revealed the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because she was unemployed and he suspected cheating. After the breakup, she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. The test showed he wasn't the father, so he asked her to leave. Now, he's being criticized by friends and mutual contacts for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are the paternity, the initial agreement to test, and the subsequent decision to leave her. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally and socially, there's the aspect of responsibility. But since the child isn't his, his obligation might be less. However, some might argue that he still has a moral responsibility if he was under the impression he was the father.\n\nThe ex cheated, which adds to the betrayal. The author's emotional state is mentioned as being raw, so his reaction might be influenced by the cheating and the stress of the situation. The fact that he agreed to the test shows he wanted to confirm the paternity, which he did. Once he found out it wasn't his, he felt justified in ending the arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is pregnant and in a vulnerable position, and some might say the author should still help regardless of the paternity. However, if the child isn't his, he isn't legally responsible, and the ex isn't his current partner anymore. The initial agreement was conditional on the paternity test, so once that was confirmed, the arrangement was void.\n\nThe friends are pressuring him, but their perspective might not consider the betrayal and the emotional toll. The author's decision might be seen as self-preservation after being wronged. So, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether one prioritizes legal/moral obligations versus personal circumstances and past actions.\n\nIn conclusion, since the child isn't his, and he had a prior agreement to test, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
