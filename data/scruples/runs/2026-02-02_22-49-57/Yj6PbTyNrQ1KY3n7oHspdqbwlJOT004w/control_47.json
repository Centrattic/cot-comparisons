It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years but had a rocky end because she lost her job, stopped looking for work, and he suspected cheating. He broke up with her, and she left. Then she came back to tell him she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out. Now he's being criticized by mutual friends for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: he suspected cheating, which turned out to be true (the child isn't his), he agreed to support her under the condition of a test. When the test came back negative, he felt betrayed and asked her to leave. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, then he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. So, he's not in the wrong legally. But morally, it's more complex. The woman is pregnant, and the child is in a vulnerable situation. The author is being criticized for not providing help, but he's also been through emotional turmoil and betrayal. \n\nThe ex cheated, which is a significant issue. The author had every reason to feel hurt and betrayed. By agreeing to the test, he showed willingness to support her if the child was his. But when it wasn't, his decision to leave was based on the truth. However, the author is now struggling with guilt and the pressure from friends. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after being misled. On the other hand, the child's well-being is a concern. But since he's not the biological father, his responsibility isn't the same. The ex is the mother, so she should be the one taking care of the child. The author isn't obligated to help unless he wants to. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the father, and he was deceived, then he's not in the wrong. The wrong here is on the ex for cheating and lying. The author's actions are a response to that betrayal. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
