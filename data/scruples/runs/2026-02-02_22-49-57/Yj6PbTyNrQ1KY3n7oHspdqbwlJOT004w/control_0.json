It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the key facts: The couple was together for two years, then the girlfriend lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and the author suspected she was cheating. They broke up, and she left. Later, she came back saying she was pregnant and they agreed to a paternity test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave again. Now, friends are criticizing him, and he's questioning his decision.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author made a wrong decision by not supporting the pregnancy after the paternity test. Let's consider the ethics. The author had agreed to take her in under the condition of the paternity test. Once it was clear he wasn't the father, he felt betrayed and didn't want to help. But the question is about his responsibility towards the unborn child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since he isn't the father, he might not have legal obligations. But morally, some might argue that he should still help, especially if the mother is struggling. However, others would say he has no obligation if he's not the father. The situation is complicated by the fact that the woman may have known he wasn't the father, which could be considered deceitful. \n\nThe author is emotionally affected by the cheating and betrayal, which adds to his stress. The mutual friends are pressuring him, but he's conflicted. The answer hinges on whether he's morally responsible for a child that isn't his. If the mother is aware of the situation and can take care of herself, maybe the author isn't at fault. But if she's in a harmful environment and he has the means, some might say he should help regardless. However, the article's question is about being in the wrong. If the author isn't the father and didn't agree to be a parent, he might not be in the wrong. The key is the paternity test result and the agreement they had. The answer could be B (he's not in the wrong) because he acted based on the test result and their prior agreement. But if there's an expectation of support regardless of paternity, then A. But since the test showed he's not the father, and the arrangement was conditional on the test, B seems more appropriate.\n"
