It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the author had a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. They had financial issues because she wasn't working, and he suspected her of cheating. He broke up with her, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay because of her mother's smoking. They arranged a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main points here: The author's decision was based on the paternity test result. Legally, if he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's dealing with his own trauma from the cheating and the breakup. The ex and mutual friends are saying he should help, but he's struggling with feelings of responsibility.\n\nBut wait, did he know about the pregnancy before the breakup? The story says she came back after the breakup to tell him about the pregnancy. So he wasn't aware when they broke up. That might matter because if he thought he was the father, he might have made different decisions. But the test proved otherwise.\n\nHowever, the ex might have known earlier that the child wasn't his. If she lied about the paternity to get him to support her, that's a different issue. But the author isn't accused of knowing that. He agreed to help based on her claim, and only found out later. \n\nHe's being blamed for not helping the child, but if he's not the father, is he morally obligated? Some might argue that once a man believes he's the father and starts supporting the child, he might have a responsibility even if it's not his. But legally, in many places, once paternity is disproven, the obligation stops. \n\nThe author is in a vulnerable emotional state, having gone through a breakup, financial strain, betrayal. His decision to end the arrangement after learning the truth is understandable. However, the child's well-being is a concern. The ex is now staying with a friend, which might not be ideal, but the author is not the father. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's complex. Legally, no. Emotionally, maybe he's conflicted. But the question is whether he's at fault. The paternity test result changes things. If he's not the father, he's not responsible. The friends' pressure might be because they don't consider the paternity aspect, but the key fact here is the child isn't his. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
