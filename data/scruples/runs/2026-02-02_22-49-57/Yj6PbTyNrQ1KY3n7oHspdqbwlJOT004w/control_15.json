It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user and their ex had a two-year relationship. The last few months were rocky because the ex lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading the user to support them financially. The user suspected cheating, which led to the breakup, and the ex moved in with her parents. Then, the ex came back to tell the user she's pregnant, which the user initially believed. They agreed to let her stay again because her mother smokes, and they wanted a healthier environment for the baby. They set a paternity test, which the ex agreed to. After a few weeks, the test showed the child isn't the user's. The user then kicks her out, leading to mutual friends and others calling the user a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nNow, the user is conflicted. They feel emotionally raw from the cheating being confirmed and the betrayal. They're torn between their emotional state and the pressure from others to take care of the child.\n\nSo, the main questions are: Is the user in the wrong for not allowing the ex to stay in his home after finding out the child isn't his? \n\nLegally, the user isn't the biological father, so he isn't legally obligated to support the child. However, there's the moral aspect. The ex is staying with a friend now to avoid her parents' smoking. The user provided a home initially under the assumption of being the father and did set up a paternity test, which the ex agreed to. Once the test showed otherwise, the user withdrew support. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the user isn't responsible for the child since it's not his. But morally, some might argue that since he initially supported the arrangement and then abruptly changed his mind, it's harsh. However, the user had valid reasons for the breakup (cheating and financial strain) and the paternity test was a condition they both agreed to. The user might feel betrayed, especially with the confirmed cheating. \n\nThe ex's friends and mutual friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but that's not his legal responsibility. The user's emotional state is also a factor; he's under a lot of stress and might need time to process. \n\nSo the key points: legal vs. moral responsibility, the initial agreement on the paternity test, the emotional context, and the ex's circumstances. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Legally, he's not obligated. Morally, while some might argue for support, the user had a condition set, which was the test, and once that was done, the arrangement was no longer valid. The user also had prior issues with cheating and financial strain. The user isn't responsible for the child, so it's not wrong for him to ask her to leave after the test.\n"
