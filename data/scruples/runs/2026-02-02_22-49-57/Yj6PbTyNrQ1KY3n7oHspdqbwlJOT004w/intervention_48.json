It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author was in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The man and his ex had a rocky relationship. She lost her job, stopped looking for work, and he had to support them financially. He suspected her of cheating, so he broke up with her. She then came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's being selfish.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. When the author agreed to support her during the pregnancy, he did so under the assumption that the child was his. Once that was proven false, his obligation might be in question. He wasn't part of the relationship when she conceived, and she didn't inform him about the possibility. That could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut on the other hand, she's pregnant and dealing with the consequences. The author is a person who had emotional struggles and felt betrayed. His decision to leave might be seen as self-preservation after being emotionally manipulated. However, the unborn child is an innocent party here. The author's actions might affect the child's well-being, especially if the mother isn't in a stable environment.\n\nLegally, paternity is established through biological ties. Since the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. But morally, it's more complex. The author had already agreed to support her until the test came back. After the result, he's within his rights to withdraw support. However, the mother's circumstances might require external help, and the author's refusal could be seen as not stepping up for someone in need, even if he's not the father.\n\nThe author's emotional state and past trauma are valid. He felt used and manipulated. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not obligated to help and the mother isn't his responsibility, then he might not be in the wrong. However, if society expects him to help regardless, then he could be seen as wrong. It's a balance between personal responsibility and societal expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the test result and his initial agreement based on the assumption of paternity, the author might not be in the wrong. He had a right to reevaluate his commitment once the truth came out. However, the moral aspect is debatable, as the child is affected. But legally and based on the information he had, he's making a decision based on new facts. So, the answer would lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
