It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant ex out when he found out the child isn't his. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, making him support both of them financially. He suspected her of cheating, which led him to break up and her moving in with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she's pregnant, assuming his child. He let her back in, but they agreed to a paternity test. When it turned out the child isn't his, he asked her to leave again.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's at fault. From a legal standpoint, if the paternity test confirms he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. Legally, the mother is responsible for the child's care, and he's within his rights to not take on that responsibility if he's not the father. However, the emotional aspect is more complex. The man is dealing with the betrayal from her cheating, which probably added to his stress and feelings of being wronged. He might be justified in not wanting to be emotionally involved with a child that isn't his, especially after the breakup.\n\nBut there's also the argument about the child's well-being. People are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the mother and the unborn child. However, the mother is the legal guardian, and unless there's a court order or some legal obligation, he isn't required to help. It's his home, and if he's not the father, he can choose not to be involved. That said, some might see this as a lack of empathy, especially if the mother is struggling. But the man is also struggling with his own emotional state and the betrayal.\n\nAnother angle: during their breakup, she was staying with her parents but then moved back in under the condition of the paternity test. Now that the test shows he's not the father, he's reverting to his original decision. It's possible he felt manipulated or used during the initial breakup, as she might have tried to keep him in the relationship through the pregnancy. But the paternity test would clear that up. If the test was his main condition for staying, then he's acting on the information he received.\n\nThe man's emotional rawness is a factor. He's been through a lot, and his reaction could be a mix of anger and relief. However, the child is innocent, but the mother is the one making choices. He isn't in a position to decide the child's living situation unless there are legal guardianship issues, which there isn't based on the story. So technically, he's not the legal guardian and can't force her to take the child elsewhere. But since the mother is with the child, her decisions about the child's environment (like staying with a friend to avoid smoke) are her responsibility.\n\nIn terms of fairness, he's not obligated to care for someone else's child. But the social aspect might make people think he should help out. However, the mother is the one who can provide care, not him. So unless he's being pressured by legal or social norms beyond his responsibility, he's not in the wrong. The key here is that the child isn't his, so he's not the one responsible for the child's well-being. The mother is, and she's chosen to stay with a friend. His decision to not let her stay is about his own home and emotional state, which he has the right to prioritize. Therefore, the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
