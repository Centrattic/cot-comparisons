It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. The key points here are the circumstances leading up to the breakup, the paternity test, and the subsequent actions.\n\nFirst, the relationship was already strained. The ex was unemployed, relying on his financial support, and he suspected cheating. Then she left after the breakup. When she returned pregnant, he agreed to let her stay but with the condition of a paternity test. That part seems reasonable. Once the test came back negative, he asked her to leave. \n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. The author isn't the biological father, so he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of the situation. The ex and friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but he's not the parent. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even if he's not the father, abandoning the woman and child during a vulnerable time could be seen as heartless. But he's not responsible for the child's well-being in a legal or moral sense if he's not the father. The fact that he allowed her to stay initially and then followed through on the paternity test shows a willingness to be involved, but once he knew the truth, he had the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. He was already stressed and hurt. Forcing him to take on a responsibility he didn't agree to could be unfair to him as well. So, I think he's not in the wrong here.\n"
