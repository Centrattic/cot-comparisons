It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship. The last few months were rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. After the test confirmed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the paternity test is reliable, the author isn't the biological father. In many jurisdictions, legal obligations to support a child typically apply if you're the biological parent or have formally adopted the child. Since he's not the father, he might not have a legal duty to provide support or housing. \n\nEthically, this is more complex. He had already agreed to provide a home to avoid the child being exposed to harmful conditions (smoking). However, once he found out he wasn't the father, he felt it was no longer his responsibility. On the other hand, some might argue that even if he's not the father, he has a moral obligation because he initially supported her and the pregnancy was a significant part of their dynamic. But others might say he's justified in removing himself from a situation where he feels betrayed, especially after her cheating was confirmed.\n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. He mentions feeling traumatized by the breakup, cheating, and the paternity revelation. His decision to ask her to leave could be seen as a way to protect himself emotionally. However, the unborn child's well-being is a concern here. If the child's mother can't provide a safe environment, others might feel he should step in despite not being the father. But the author isn't the parent, so his obligation isn't the same as a legal parent.\n\nAnother angle: The mutual friends and her circle are pressuring him. They might be right in the sense that the child's needs matter, but the author isn't the parent. He's not responsible for her choices, even if he helped her before. The initial agreement was conditional on the paternity test, which he honored. Once the test came back negative, the condition was met, so his decision to end the arrangement is within the boundaries he set.\n\nHowever, there's a possible lack of follow-through. When he agreed to let her stay, he might have assumed the risk of her not being pregnant with his child. But he set the condition for a test, which she agreed to. So, he's not at fault for acting on the test results. \n\nIn summary, the author made a decision based on the test result and his personal circumstances. Legally, he's not responsible. Ethically, it's debatable, but he's not in the wrong because he followed through on his initial terms and isn't the biological father. The pressure from others might be about the child's well-being, but he's not the parent, so his responsibility isn't absolute. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
