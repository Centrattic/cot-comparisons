It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author had a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. Things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, making him support them both financially. He suspected she was cheating, which led to a breakup, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay again because her mom smokes a lot, which he thought wasn't good for the unborn child. They agreed to a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he told her to leave. Now, her friends and mutual friends are saying he's a bad person for not letting the child live with him, and he's conflicted about whether he was right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. The author and his ex were in a relationship for two years, but the last months were difficult. She lost her job and wasn't contributing, which he found burdensome. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to her parents. Then she returned with news of pregnancy, and he allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. The main issue here is whether he was wrong to kick her out once he found out the child isn't his.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the paternity test is confirmed and he's not the biological father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. However, if he had previously led her to believe he was the father or had made any commitments to support the child, that might complicate things. But in the scenario, they both agreed to the test, and after the result, he made a decision based on that information.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal (cheating confirmed) and the realization that he's not the father. His friends are pressuring him to take responsibility, but he's struggling with his feelings. The question is about fairness and whether he's being a \"piece of shit\" for not wanting to support the child now.\n\nEthically, some might argue that once a relationship has produced a child, there's a responsibility to support it, regardless of paternity. But technically, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation. However, if he had been in a committed relationship and the pregnancy was a result of that, even if he's not the biological father, some could say he shares in the responsibility of the relationship's outcomes. But that's more of a moral stance rather than a legal one.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own emotional state. He mentions feeling emotionally raw and having gone through a lot. If he's not in a stable place to support the pregnancy, whether the child is his or not, it's understandable he might not want to. However, the unborn child is part of his ex and her family, so the decision to live with someone else is between her and her parents/friends, not necessarily his responsibility unless he had agreed to be a co-parent or something similar.\n\nThe key points here are: the paternity test confirmed it's not his, he had a valid reason for the initial breakup (financial burden and suspected cheating), and he's now facing social pressure to support the pregnancy despite not being the father. The ex's family environment is problematic, but he's not taking the child in. He's allowing the ex to stay with a friend to avoid the smoke, but not in his home post-test. So, he's already helped her avoid the bad environment by letting her stay in a friend's place. \n\nIf the friends are suggesting he should take her in, maybe to help the child, but legally and realistically he has no duty to do so. The author's decision seems based on the test result and his own emotional state. It's possible that people are conflating the child's well-being with the author's responsibility, but unless he's the father, his obligation is minimal. However, some might argue that if the relationship was such that they were co-parenting, even without a legal tie, there's a moral obligation. But the author's own feelings of betrayal and the confirmed cheating might affect that. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is required to support the child just because the mother was in their home. Since the child isn't his and he's not in a relationship anymore, he's not wrong for not wanting to take on the responsibility. Friends may feel he's being harsh, but legally and ethically, if the test is correct, he's not the father. The answer is probably B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
