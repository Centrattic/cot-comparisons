It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. The situation is complex with several layers.\n\nFirst, the author had a rough breakup because the ex wasn't working and was living off him. Then, the ex came back pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. When the test showed he's not the father, he asked her to leave. Now, friends are calling him a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the author isn't the biological father, he's not obligated to support the child. However, there's a moral question here. Did he have any responsibility once he found out? The ex might be in a vulnerable position, and the author's decision could affect her and the child's well-being. \n\nEmotionally, the author was through a lot\u2014suspected cheating, financial strain, and the stress of possibly being a father. His reaction might be understandable from his perspective. But does that justify not helping? There's a difference between being legally and morally responsible. Even if he's not legally responsible, society might expect him to do the right thing.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex had a history of not contributing financially and possibly cheating. The author might feel betrayed, and his emotional state is valid. However, the child is innocent here. The author's decision might be seen as heartless, even if legally justified.\n\nI should also think about societal expectations. People might argue that the author should help out regardless, especially since he supported the ex during the pregnancy. But others might say he's not obligated to help with someone else's child. \n\nThe key points are the paternity test result, the ex's past behavior, and the author's emotional state. The answer hinges on whether the author has a moral duty to stay involved despite not being the father. If he feels it's unfair, that's his right, but society might judge him harshly for not helping an innocent child. \n\nConsidering all angles, I think the author is not in the wrong legally, but morally, it's a gray area. However, since the question is about right or wrong, and not legal obligation, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong if we prioritize the child's needs over his feelings. But there's a strong argument for his perspective too.\n"
