It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend when he found out the child wasn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but the relationship became rocky. The ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on the author financially. The author suspected cheating and broke up with her. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed she could stay but wanted a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he told her to leave. Now, people are saying he's being unfair to the unborn child.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author had the condition of a paternity test before allowing her to stay. She agreed. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he followed through on his condition. Legally, he's not responsible for the child since he's not the father. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal from cheating and financial strain. \n\nBut wait, is there any obligation beyond the test? He allowed her to stay temporarily under the agreement of the test. Once that agreement was fulfilled, he's not obligated to continue supporting her. The ex's family issues (smoking) are her problem to handle now. The author's decision to not take responsibility for a child that isn't his seems justified, especially given the prior issues. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once he became aware of the pregnancy and allowed her to stay, he has some moral duty. But since the child isn't his, and he wasn't part of the conception, that argument is weaker. Also, the mutual friends' judgment might stem from a place of not understanding the context of the cheating and financial burden.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author made a clear boundary and followed through. The ex's happiness when finding out the pregnancy might indicate she knew it wasn't his, but he had the right to test. The author's emotional state is valid; he's been through a lot. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
