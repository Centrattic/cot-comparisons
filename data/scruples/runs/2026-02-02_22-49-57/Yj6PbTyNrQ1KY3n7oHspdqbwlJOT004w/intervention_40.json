It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after discovering the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the key facts: They were together for two years but had a rocky relationship. The ex lost her job and wasn't contributing financially, leading the author to break up. She then came back, claiming pregnancy, and they agreed to a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, friends are criticizing him for not helping the child.\n\nSo, legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to provide support. Ethically, it's trickier. The author might feel betrayed, especially since she had been cheating. However, the argument against him is that the child is innocent and shouldn't suffer because of her actions. But the author is also dealing with his own emotional trauma and stress.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if the author has a duty to support a child he's not the father of. If he's not the biological father, there's no legal obligation. But if the mother is his ex, maybe he has a moral obligation due to their past relationship? Not necessarily, unless he had agreed to support the child. Since he was under the impression it was his, but the test proved otherwise, maybe he's justified in stepping away.\n\nAlso, the mother is still responsible. She's the one who needs to care for the child. The author isn't the parent. So, from a legal standpoint, he's not obligated. Ethically, if he can help without being the father, maybe he should, but he's not required. His decision to step back after the betrayal makes sense. The friends' criticism might not consider his emotional state and the betrayal he faced.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). He's not legally or morally obligated to support a child that's not his, especially after the circumstances of cheating and financial strain. His actions are within his rights, even if others disapprove.\n"
