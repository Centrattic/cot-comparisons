It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, the relationship got rocky, he suspected cheating, broke up. Then she comes back pregnant, he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test shows the child isn't his, and he kicks her out. Now people are saying he's being a bad person for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author allowed her to stay under the condition that the child was his. Once the paternity test cleared that up, he no longer felt responsible. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nLegal perspective: If the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. However, there's a social and moral aspect. The woman is vulnerable, pregnant, and might not have other support. The author is dealing with emotional fallout from cheating and being financially strained. \n\nHe's been through a lot\u2014maybe the emotional trauma makes his reaction understandable. But on the other hand, abandoning someone in a vulnerable state could be seen as heartless. However, he's not obligated to take care of someone else's child. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are pressuring him, but that might not mean he's wrong. The main issue is his responsibility. If he didn't father the child, does he have a duty to help? It's a gray area. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author is in the wrong for not accepting responsibility for a child that isn't his. Legally, no. Morally, it's debatable. The woman might need help regardless of the paternity, but the author has the right to prioritize his well-being after betrayal and stress. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's not responsible for someone else's child and has the right to make decisions based on his circumstances.\n"
