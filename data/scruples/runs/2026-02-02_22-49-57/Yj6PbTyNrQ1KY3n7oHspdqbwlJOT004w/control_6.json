It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out when he found out the child wasn't his. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were in a 2-year relationship, but it got rocky towards the end. The girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was supporting them both. He suspected cheating, and that led to the breakup. She left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test, which showed the child isn't his. He then asked her to leave.\n\nThe main issue here is whether he was wrong to not allow the child to stay once he found out it's not his. The ex is now back with her parents, but staying with a friend. People are telling him he's a bad person for not taking care of the child. He's feeling conflicted because he went through emotional turmoil and feels he shouldn't have to \"suck it up.\"\n\nSo, legally, if the child is not his, he has no obligation to support it. However, the ex might be trying to use him for financial gain even after the breakup. Emotionally, he was already hurt by the cheating, and this adds more betrayal. But on the other hand, the child is innocent. But wait, the child's parent (his ex) is the one who might be at fault here. He had a paternity test done, which he had the right to do. The ex knew he was doing the test and agreed to it, so there's a mutual understanding. \n\nIf the child isn't his, then his responsibility to the child is not legal, but maybe moral. But he might have trusted her when she said the child was his. If he's feeling emotionally raw and can't handle the situation, maybe it's understandable. But others might argue that once he knew the child was coming, he should have been supportive regardless. However, since the child isn't his, he might not have a duty. \n\nThe ex's behavior is questionable\u2014maybe she tried to trap him into staying, and after the test, he realized he wasn't the father. So, he's not in the wrong for not taking responsibility for a child that isn't his. The people criticizing him might be missing the fact that the ex is the one who was deceptive. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
