It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, but their relationship was rocky near the end, leading to a breakup. She lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he had to support them both. He suspected she was cheating. Then she came back pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, friends are calling him a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me break down the key points. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support them. Emotionally, he's been through a lot: possible fatherhood, betrayal from cheating. He was already financially supporting her before the breakup, which might have been a strain. \n\nBut there's also the unborn child's well-being. Even if it's not his, the child needs a safe environment. She's staying with a friend to avoid smoking at her parents'. He has the space, and mutual friends argue he should help. However, he's emotionally raw and possibly dealing with post-breakup stress.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, no. But morally, some might say he should help regardless. Others might argue he's entitled to his own emotional state. The answer hinges on balancing his mental health with the child's needs. The user's own opinion is that he's not in the wrong, so I need to see if the facts support that. The main factors are the paternity test result, the prior cheatings, and the financial strain. \n\nIn the end, since the child isn't his and he's not legally obligated to support them, but morally it's a gray area. However, given the circumstances he described, including her cheating and the emotional toll, it's reasonable to say he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
