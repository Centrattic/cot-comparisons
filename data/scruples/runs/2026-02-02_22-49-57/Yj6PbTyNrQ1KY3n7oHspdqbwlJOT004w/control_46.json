It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man and his ex had a two-year relationship. It ended because she lost her job, stopped looking for work, and he suspected cheating. He broke up with her, but she came back pregnant, thinking it's his child. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. When the test shows it's not his, he kicks her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nThe key points here are the paternity test result, the emotional state of the author, and the responsibilities towards the unborn child. Legally, since the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it financially. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, possible cheating, and the stress of thinking he was a father. Socially, others are pressuring him to help, but his home is a safe environment, and he's not the legal parent.\n\nBut then there's the moral aspect. Even if it's not his child, the woman he was in a relationship with is pregnant and in a difficult situation. He might feel a moral duty to help, especially if he contributed to the situation by agreeing to support her temporarily. However, he's also dealing with his own emotional trauma and betrayal. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. But morally, some might argue he should help because she's in a vulnerable state. Others might say he's justified in prioritizing his own mental health after the betrayal. However, kicking her out after she was relying on his home for a safe environment might be seen as unfair, especially if she's now without support. \n\nBut since the child isn't his, he has no legal responsibility. The ex's actions (cheating) might also affect his willingness to help. However, the unborn child is innocent. The author's decision to kick her out could be seen as abandoning someone in need, which could be considered morally wrong. But considering his personal circumstances and the fact that he's not the biological father, it's a tough call. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether one prioritizes legal/actual parental responsibility versus moral obligations. Since the law doesn't bind him, but society might expect community support, maybe he's in the wrong. However, his emotional state is valid. I think the consensus leans towards him not being in the wrong because the child isn't his, but there's a gray area. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. The ex is the one who cheated and had an affair, leading to the child. The author might not be at fault for not supporting a child he isn't responsible for. So answer B.\n"
