It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out their pregnant ex when she wasn't carrying his child. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because she lost her job, stopped looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. She left and went to her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed she wasn't pregnant with his child, so he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are criticizing him for not supporting her and the child, even though it's not his.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he isn't legally obligated to support it. But ethically, it's more complicated. People might argue that he has a moral responsibility to help, especially since he initially supported her and the pregnancy. However, considering he was already dealing with betrayal and the emotional strain, his decision might be seen as understandable from his perspective.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of him financially supporting her when he thought the child was his. Now that the paternity is proven otherwise, he might feel justified in not continuing support. However, some might say that once he knew she was pregnant, even if the child isn't his, he should still help because she's in a vulnerable position. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional trauma from the cheating and the stress of the situation. His mental health is a factor here too. He might be overwhelmed and not in a good place to take on more responsibility. \n\nThe key points are the paternity test results, the emotional toll, and the sudden change in circumstances. Legally, he's not in the wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. The ex's cheating and the author's prior support could tip the scales either way. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the child isn't his, and he's dealing with the aftermath of a betrayal. But others might argue he should help regardless. However, considering the context provided, the author's actions are within his rights and his emotional state is a valid reason for his decision.\n"
