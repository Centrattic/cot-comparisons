It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for kicking their pregnant ex out after a paternity test showed the child isn't theirs. They were in a 2-year relationship, which ended when they broke up, and the ex moved back in with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay again because he didn't want the baby exposed to his ex's smoking. They agreed to a paternity test, which the ex was happy about. After the test came back negative, the author told her to leave. Now she and others are saying he's a bad person for not supporting the child.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. The author didn't know the child was someone else's until the test confirmed it. Before that, he made an agreement with her to get the test, and she agreed. After the betrayal of being cheated on and the emotional stress, he decided not to support the pregnancy. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for this decision.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't the legal father, so he isn't obligated to support the child. But the situation is more about moral and emotional responsibility. The user is feeling conflicted because he's been through a lot, but others are pressuring him to help. \n\nEmotionally, the author might feel hurt and used, especially if the pregnancy was a way for the ex to get back into his life. However, the ex was already pregnant when they broke up, so maybe he was being manipulated. On the other hand, he might be seen as abandoning a vulnerable person just because the child isn't his. \n\nBut he did agree to the paternity test, which was fair. Once the test showed the child isn't his, his responsibility towards the child might not be expected. The user is not being forced to take care of someone else's child, especially after the relationship ended and the trust was broken. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the ex's parents' environment. The author wanted to protect the baby from smoking, so he took her in. But now that it's someone else's child, maybe he feels it's not his responsibility anymore. The ex is staying with a friend to avoid the smoking, so she's trying to find an alternative. \n\nThe user is feeling guilt and pressure from friends. But is he wrong? If he's not the father, then perhaps it's reasonable for him to not take responsibility. However, if he's known about the pregnancy and the ex is in a difficult situation, some might argue he should support her out of compassion, even if not legally required. \n\nBut the key points are the cheating, the agreement to test, and the result. The user followed through on the test and made a decision based on the outcome. It's important that he was upfront and agreed to the test. Once the truth came out, he's not obligated to help with someone else's child. His emotional state is also valid; he's dealing with betrayal and a tough breakup. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision seems to be based on the agreed-upon paternity test and the reality that the child isn't his. While some might criticize his lack of support, legally and morally, he isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, No.\n"
