It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. The last few months were rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, which led him to break up and she went to live with her parents. Then, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and after the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The ex and others are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child. He's conflicted because he's emotionally raw, feels betrayed by her cheating, and is considering whether he should take responsibility despite the child not being his.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, in many places, a biological father has certain rights and responsibilities, but the author isn't the biological father. However, if he was acting as a de facto parent or had assumed responsibility, there might be legal obligations. But since the child isn't his, maybe he's not legally bound to support them. \n\nEthically, it's more complex. He provided shelter initially, which could create an expectation of continued support. But once the paternity was disproven, does he have a moral duty to keep supporting them? Some might argue that by allowing her to stay, he created a dependency, so cutting off support could be seen as abandoning them. Others might say that since the child isn't his, he's under no obligation and that his emotional well-being is valid to consider.\n\nHe also suspected cheating, which was confirmed later. That adds another layer of betrayal. However, regardless of her actions, the unborn child is innocent. There's a balance between his right to emotional recovery and the child's need for support. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If we look from a moral standpoint, some people might think that once he took on a role of supporting the ex and the child, he should continue even if the paternity was a mistake. Others might say his decision is understandable given the circumstances, especially the betrayal and emotional turmoil. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often pressure to support children, but if there's no legal obligation, maybe it's more about personal choice. However, by initially agreeing to let her stay, there's a social contract element. Breaking that might be seen as wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there's an expectation of continued support once he's involved in their lives. Since the child isn't his, he's not legally responsible, but morally, it's a gray area. The ex and mutual friends are criticizing him, implying he should help the child regardless of the circumstances. However, the author's mental health and the betrayal by the ex are also factors. \n\nGiven that the child isn't his and he wasn't aware of the pregnancy when he broke up initially, but then chose to take her back under the condition of a test, once the test came back negative, his choice to end the arrangement might be seen as more about his own well-being. But the sudden withdrawal after offering support could be seen as abandoning them in a vulnerable time. \n\nI'm leaning towards the answer being A (the author is in the wrong) because once he took on the responsibility, even temporarily, there's an expectation of continued support, especially for an unborn child. However, if he had made it clear that support was conditional on the paternity test, then it's different. The story says he agreed to let her stay with the caveat of the test, so maybe he's within his rights to cut ties once the test shows no paternity. But the fact that others are criticizing him suggests society might see his actions as harsh. \n\nBut in the end, without legal obligation, it's more about moral judgment. If the author is making a choice based on his own emotional state and the betrayal, it's his right to prioritize himself. However, the child's needs are also important. Since the answer is A or B, and given the public's view in similar situations, perhaps A is correct because of the sudden withdrawal and the child's vulnerability. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B because he's not legally responsible and has the right to prioritize his mental health after betrayal. Hmm.\n"
