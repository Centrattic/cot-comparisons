It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author and his ex were together for two years. They had some issues, like financial problems when she lost her job, and he suspected her of cheating. They broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she got pregnant and came back to his house, assuming he was the father. He agreed to let her stay but asked for a paternity test. After the test showed he wasn't the father, he kicked her out. Now, friends are saying he's being a bad person for not supporting her and the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the pregnancy wasn't his, he had already broken up with her before finding out, there were existing tensions (cheating, financial issues), and he felt betrayed when the paternity test didn't go his way. He's now being pressured to take her back and support the child, but he's emotionally overwhelmed.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, the biological father isn't responsible unless he's been recognized as such. Since the test proved he's not the father, he doesn't have legal obligations. Ethically, it's about his responsibility. Since he's not the father, is he morally obligated to help her? That's debatable. Some might argue that if he's in a relationship and she got pregnant, he should support regardless, but in this case, they were already broken up, and the pregnancy was discovered after the fact. Plus, the cheating adds another layer of betrayal.\n\nThe woman is now expecting a child that's not his, and he might feel she's being deceptive. However, she might have genuinely thought he was the father. But he had asked for a paternity test, so maybe she should have been honest from the start. But the scenario doesn't mention her lying; she came to tell him she was pregnant, assuming he was the father. She might not have known.\n\nEmotionally, the author is going through a lot. He's hurt from the breakup, the cheating, and the financial strain. Kicking her out after the test result seems harsh, but he's not the father. The friends are pressuring him, saying he's a bad person, but maybe they don't realize the context. He's in a vulnerable time, and the child isn't his, so he might not feel responsible. However, some might argue that he should still help her out of compassion, regardless of the paternity.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the father, then legally he's not obligated. Ethically, it's a gray area. But since he's the one who allowed her to stay under the assumption he was the father, maybe he feels a responsibility. However, once the paternity is proven false, he's not bound. The cheating and financial issues also play into his decision. So, considering all factors, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might say he should help because she's vulnerable regardless.\n"
