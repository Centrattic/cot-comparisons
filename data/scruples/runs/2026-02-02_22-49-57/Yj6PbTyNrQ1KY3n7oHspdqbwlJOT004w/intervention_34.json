It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, they were together for two years but had a rocky relationship, especially when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work. He broke up with her, and she moved in with her parents. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he asks her to leave. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not supporting the child, even though he didn't father it.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Legally, he's not the father, so there's no duty to provide financial or housing support. But morally, it's a different question. Even if he's not the father, he might feel a responsibility because he was in a relationship with the mother and had some involvement. However, since the relationship was already broken up, and she was cheating, there might be less obligation.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The cheating and the breakup probably caused a lot of stress. He might feel betrayed, which explains his reaction. But on the other hand, the woman is now alone with an unborn child, and others are criticizing him for not helping. The key here is whether he has a moral duty to help even though he's not the father. Some might argue that he's being selfish, but others might say he's justified in not taking responsibility for a child that isn't his, especially after the cheating.\n\nAnother angle is the initial arrangement. He allowed her to stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he followed through on his agreement. That seems fair. If he had agreed to help regardless of the test result, it would be different, but he set clear terms. So, he's not in the wrong for following through.\n\nAlso, the ex's parents are smokers, which is a health risk. He wanted to protect the child, but since the child isn't his, maybe he can't enforce that. However, he did consider her well-being by offering her a place before the test. Now, after the test, he's removing himself from the situation, which he has the right to do.\n\nThe mutual friends are pressuring him, but their opinion doesn't necessarily make him wrong. It's about his personal choice and what he's comfortable with. If he's not the father, and the relationship is over, he's under no obligation to support someone else's child. So, the answer is likely B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
