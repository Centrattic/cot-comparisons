It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the author had a two-year relationship that ended because the ex wasn't working and was financially dependent. He suspected cheating and broke up, then she moved in with her parents. She came back to tell him she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, it came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are saying he's being unfair to the unborn child.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the key points here are consent and responsibility. The author agreed to let her stay on the condition of the paternity test. Once he found out the child wasn't his, he had the right to change his mind. The woman is now expecting someone else's child, which is her responsibility. The author isn't obligated to care for a child that isn't his. \n\nHowever, there's a social aspect. Some might argue that he should help out of humanity, but legally and ethically, he's not bound to. The ex cheated, which adds to his betrayal. The author is dealing with emotional turmoil, and his decision to leave was based on the test result. The child's well-being is a concern, but the author's mental state is also valid. \n\nIs he being unfair? If he's not the father, then he's not responsible. The real father should be involved. The author's actions, while harsh, are within his rights given the circumstances. The fact that she cheated and the financial strain before adds context. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
