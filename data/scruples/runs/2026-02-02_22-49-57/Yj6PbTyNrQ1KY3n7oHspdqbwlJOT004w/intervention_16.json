It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after discovering the child isn't his. The setup is that they were in a two-year relationship, which ended because the ex was losing her job, not looking for work, and he suspected cheating. After the breakup, she came back pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he kicked her out. Now she and others are saying he's a bad person for not supporting the child.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the author suspected cheating, got a paternity test, discovered it's not his, and then asked her to leave. The ex is now pregnant with someone else's child, and he's being criticized for not taking responsibility.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the paternity test confirms the child isn't his, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. Legally, the father is the one who is biologically related. So in that sense, the author might not be in the wrong. But socially or morally, the question is more complex.\n\nEmotionally, he went through a breakup, suspected infidelity, and then confirmed the child isn't his. His reaction of not wanting to be around the situation is understandable. But others are saying he should take responsibility, even if it's not his child. That's the crux here: should he take on a role as a father or support the child even if he's not the biological father?\n\nSome might argue that stepping up as a father is noble, but it's not a legal obligation. Others might say that once a relationship is in place and a child is involved, regardless of paternity, he might have a moral or emotional responsibility. However, the user's question is framed as whether he's in the wrong, which could be about legal, moral, or social aspects.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's emotionally raw and doesn't want to be responsible for someone else's child. The ex is cheating, and the child isn't his. So from his perspective, he's not in the wrong. But others are judging him for not helping the child.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's debatable. If he chose to support the child, that would be a kind act, but he's not obligated to. The fact that he agreed to the paternity test shows he was willing to take responsibility if it was his, but since it's not, he's within his rights to not support it. However, some might say that once he was in the situation with the pregnant woman, he may have some ongoing commitment, but that's more of a personal choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong legally, and morally, it's a personal decision. The question is whether he's in the wrong, and since the user thinks he's not, I lean towards answer B (No). The key is that he's not legally responsible and made a personal choice based on the new information, which others might criticize, but it's his right to make that decision.\n"
