It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out because the child isn't his. They had a two-year relationship, which was rocky towards the end. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was supporting them both. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, if the paternity test shows he's not the father, he's not obligated to support the child. But there's the emotional and moral aspect. The ex and friends are saying he should help the \"innocent\" child. The author is conflicted, feeling emotionally raw after the breakup and betrayal.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, he's not responsible for the child if he's not the father. But morally, some might argue that he has a responsibility because he was involved with the mother and the child's well-being is a factor. However, the mother was the one who had the relationship with the author, and if he's not the father, his responsibility might be less. But the mother could be seeking support, and the author might feel pressured because of their past relationship.\n\nThere's also the issue of the mother's behavior. She lost her job, wasn't contributing, and he suspected cheating. The breaking up was on his part, so maybe he's justified in not wanting to take her back. The paternity test was a condition he set, and she agreed. So when it came back negative, he followed through. \n\nHowever, the child is innocent, and there's a question of whether the author should take responsibility. But if the mother is the parent, then she should be the one to care for the child. The author isn't the father, so he's not legally obligated. Emotionally, it's a tough spot, but he's also dealing with betrayal. \n\nThe author might be in a place where he can't handle the situation right now, especially after the breakup. The friends' pressure could be adding to his emotional stress. So, is he in the wrong? If he's not the father, then maybe not. But there's a moral argument for supporting the mother if he was in a relationship with her, but again, he's not the father. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He set the conditions, and when they weren't met, he followed through. The child's responsibility lies with the mother and the actual father. The author isn't obligated to take care of a child that isn't his. Therefore, the answer would be B (No)."
