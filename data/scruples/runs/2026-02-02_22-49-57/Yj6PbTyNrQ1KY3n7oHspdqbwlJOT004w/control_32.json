It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, broke up when she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay, with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he kicked her out. Now, others are saying he's being a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nHe's feeling conflicted, especially after emotional turmoil. The main question is whether he's wrong to do that. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if he's not the biological father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. However, there's the ethical angle. Even if he's not the father, the child might need support. But he's not the parent here. The mother is responsible. The author might feel a moral duty if he thought he was the father, but once that's proven wrong, maybe he's not obligated. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of emotional investment. He thought he was the father and agreed to help, but the betrayal from cheating adds another layer. He might feel manipulated. However, kicking someone out in the middle of a pregnancy could be seen as harsh. But since he's not the father, maybe he's not legally or morally required to take care of them. \n\nSociety often expects people to step up for children, but if there's no legal tie, it's different. The mother's family isn't helping, so maybe she's in need, but is that his responsibility? The author might be in a vulnerable place emotionally, and his decision is influenced by betrayal and stress. \n\nHowever, the child's well-being is a concern. Even if he's not the father, could he provide a better environment? But he's also dealing with personal issues. The answer hinges on whether his decision is fair given he's not the father. Since he's not responsible for the child, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should help regardless. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's not the father and thus not obligated. But there's a gray area regarding moral responsibility. However, legally and ethically, the mother is responsible for the child. The author can choose to help if he wants, but he's not wrong for choosing not to.\n"
