It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a rocky relationship. She lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he had to support her. He suspected cheating, then broke up with her. She came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay, but with the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether he's responsible for supporting the child. Since the child isn't his, legally he has no obligation. But there's a moral angle here. Even if the child isn't his, he had agreed to help her, maybe out of good faith. However, once the paternity test showed he's not the father, his responsibility might be off the table. \n\nBut wait, what about the emotional aspect? He feels used, and she cheated. The mutual friends are calling him a bad person, but he's dealing with betrayal and financial stress. Even though the child isn't his, he might still feel a sense of responsibility, but he's also not obligated. \n\nLegally, he's not the father, so he's not required to provide support. Morally, some might argue he should still help because he was supportive during the pregnancy. But others might say he's justified in cutting ties after finding out the child isn't his, especially since he was already a victim of betrayal. \n\nThe key points are the paternity test result and mutual agreement before the test. Since he made it clear that the condition was the paternity test, and once that was done, he followed through on his caveat. So, he's not in the wrong legally, and morally, it's a gray area, but given the circumstances, he's justified in his actions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
