It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship. It got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back not his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, he's being criticized by her, friends, etc., for not taking care of the child. He's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, a man isn't legally obligated to support a child that isn't his. So if the test proves he's not the father, he has no legal responsibility. However, there's the moral aspect. \n\nMoral considerations: Did he have a duty to help the mother and child despite not being the father? Well, the mother is the primary caregiver. The author isn't the father, so he's not morally bound to help unless there's some other agreement. But he allowed her to stay temporarily to avoid exposure to her mother's smoking. Once the paternity was confirmed, his responsibility might end.\n\nEmotional factors: He's dealing with betrayal from cheating and emotional stress. His decision might be influenced by his own emotional state. However, the child's well-being is a concern. Is the author being selfish by not helping?\n\nBut the mother is still responsible. The author isn't the parent, so he's not in the wrong legally. Morally, it's debatable. If the mother is capable of caring for the child (even if temporarily with a friend), maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the child is in immediate danger, then there are other steps like involving social services. But the scenario doesn't mention any danger beyond the mother's parents' smoking. The mother is staying with a friend, so maybe the child is safe.\n\nAlso, the author allowed her to stay temporarily. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he ended the arrangement. That's within his rights. He's not obligated to host her indefinitely. The friends are pressuring him to help, but it's not his responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had no obligation to support the child since he's not the father. His decision to end the arrangement after the paternity test is confirmed is within his rights. However, it's a sensitive situation, but legally and morally (without legal obligation), he's not at fault.\n"
