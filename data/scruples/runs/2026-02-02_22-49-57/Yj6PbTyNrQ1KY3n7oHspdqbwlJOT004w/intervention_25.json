It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment on whether kicking out their pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't theirs was the right move.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex were together for two years. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was financially supporting her. He suspected her of cheating and broke up with her. She came back saying she was pregnant and wanted to stay with him instead of her parents because her mom smokes. They agreed to a paternity test, which she agreed to. After the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main points to consider: Legally, if he wasn't the father, he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal from the cheating and the stress of the pregnancy. The ex and mutual friends are pressuring him to take her in again. The author is feeling conflicted between his emotional state and societal expectations.\n\nLegally, he has no obligation. He can choose not to be involved. But morally, some might argue he should help her, especially since she's pregnant and in a vulnerable state. However, since he found out the child isn't his, he's not the legal father. The cheating adds another layer of betrayal, which can justify his decision to cut ties.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that even if the child isn't his, he's still responsible for her because they were in a relationship. But she was the one who came back to him, and he had the paternity test done, which was a reasonable step. He provided a safe environment until the test results, which was a good-faith effort.\n\nThe key here is whether he's obligated to support someone else's child. If the child isn't his, he's not legally or morally bound to do so. His decision to leave the situation might be seen as self-preservation after betrayal. The pressure from friends might be based on assumptions that he's the father, but he's not. So, the answer would likely be B (he's not in the wrong), as he's acting within his rights and emotions given the circumstances.\n"
