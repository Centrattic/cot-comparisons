It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were together for two years but had a rocky end. She lost her job, wasn't contributing financially, and he suspected cheating. He broke up with her, and she moved in with her parents. Then she comes back to tell him she's pregnant, thinking it's his. He lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test, which she agrees to. The test shows it's not his, so he kicks her out. Now he's being criticized for not helping the child, but he's feeling emotionally raw and uncertain.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. However, morally or ethically, it's more complex. The author might feel that since he's not the biological father, he's not responsible for the child. On the other hand, some might argue that once you become involved in someone's life, especially in a relationship, there might be expectations of support, even if not legally bound.\n\nThe girlfriend cheated on him, which adds another layer. The author's decision could be seen as a reaction to betrayal. But then again, the child is innocent. The author is also dealing with emotional stress and past issues. He might be justified in not wanting to take on the responsibility of a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship ended poorly.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that once he agreed to let her stay and get the test, he might have shown willingness to support the child if it were his. Now that it's not, is it fair to cut off support entirely? But since he's not the father, maybe he's not obligated. The key here is the initial agreement: he had the caveat of the paternity test, which she agreed to. So the decision wasn't made in bad faith. He followed through on the terms they set.\n\nI think the author's actions are legally sound and morally debatable. The answer depends on whether you prioritize legal obligations over moral responsibility. Since the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" and if it's about moral wrong, some might say yes, but if it's about legal or ethical wrong, maybe not. The author's perspective is that he's not responsible, and he's prioritizing his emotional well-being. The answer is likely B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong given the paternity test results and the agreed terms.\n"
