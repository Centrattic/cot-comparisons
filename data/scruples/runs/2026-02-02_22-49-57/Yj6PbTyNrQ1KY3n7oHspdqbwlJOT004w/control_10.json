It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the couple was together for two years. Then the relationship became rocky because the girlfriend lost her job and the author had to support them financially. The author suspects cheating and eventually breaks up, leading her to live with her parents. She comes back pregnant, and they agree to a paternity test. When the test comes back negative, he kicks her out. Now, he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a man isn't automatically a legal father unless it's established through paternity tests or other means. Since the test showed he's not the father, he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. Ethically, though, it's more complex. People often feel a moral obligation to support a child they believed was theirs, even if the test proves otherwise. But the author was already in a broken relationship, dealing with financial strain and possible infidelity. \n\nThe girlfriend cheated, which adds another layer. The emotional betrayal might justify his decision. However, the author is being criticized for not helping the pregnant woman, especially since she's in a vulnerable state. Society often expects men to step up, but in this case, the child isn't his, so it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the author allowed her to stay temporarily to avoid the mother's smoking, but after the paternity test, he changed his mind. The mother is now staying with a friend. The author's emotional state is mentioned\u2014he's feeling raw and conflicted. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's debatable. If he believed the child was his and then found out it wasn't, he might feel relieved, but the woman is still in a tough spot. However, the cheating was confirmed, which adds to the betrayal. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he's not the biological father and the relationship was already broken. But there's also the argument that he could show compassion regardless.\n\nI think the key points are the confirmed paternity and the cheating. Since the child isn't his and the relationship was already ending, his decision might be understandable. But some might argue that he should still help her. However, given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
