It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend when he found out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation step by step. The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship became rocky when she lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on him financially. He suspected her of cheating and broke up with her. She left to live with her parents.\n\nLater, she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agrees, and they get the test done. The result shows the child isn't his. He then asks her to leave. Now, she's staying with a friend, and people are criticizing him for not supporting her and the child.\n\nThe key points here are: the breakup context, financial support, suspected infidelity, and the paternity test. The author had already broken up with her because of these issues. When she came back with the pregnancy claim, he allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once it was confirmed the child isn't his, he ends the arrangement.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, once the paternity is disproven, the author is not legally obligated to support the child. However, the moral aspect is more complex. The ex had a chance to have a paternity test before moving in, but she agreed to it. The author might feel betrayed again, especially if her cheating was confirmed, which adds to his emotional distress.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The main argument is that the author isn't responsible for supporting a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship issues. On the other hand, some might argue he should show compassion regardless. But since he agreed to the test and acted on the results, it's a personal decision based on his circumstances. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. He had the right to set boundaries, especially given the prior issues and the confirmed non-paternity.\n"
