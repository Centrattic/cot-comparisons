It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking for an opinion on whether kicking out a pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't theirs was fair.\n\nFirst, the user was in a two-year relationship with their ex. The relationship got rocky because the ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on the user's financial support. Plus, the user suspected cheating, which led to the breakup and her moving in with her parents. Then, she came back to say she was pregnant, which the user initially accepted because they wanted the child to be in a smoke-free environment. They agreed to a paternity test, which the ex accepted. After the test came back negative, the user asked her to leave. Now, she and others are telling the user they're a bad person for not taking care of the child.\n\nThe user is feeling torn. They're emotionally raw, dealing with betrayal, and considering if they should take her back. The question is about whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nLet me think about the key points. Legally, if the paternity test is confirmed, the user isn't the father, so they might not have a legal obligation. But morally or ethically? The user provided a home initially, but when they found out the child wasn't theirs, they changed their mind. The ex is now staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking and other problems. The user is being pressured to let her stay for the child's sake.\n\nPossible arguments for the user being in the wrong (A): They might be seen as abandoning the child, especially since they were initially supportive. Even if they aren't the father, the child might be in a vulnerable position. Also, the user chose to let her stay in their home, possibly expecting some level of commitment. Others might argue that the user should take responsibility, especially if the ex is in a bad situation with her parents.\n\nArguments for the user not being in the wrong (B): The user had the right to know if they were the father, and after the test, they have no legal or genetic responsibility. The relationship was already broken, and the user was facing financial strain and emotional stress. They might not be in a position to support another family, even if they weren't the father. The user's decision could be seen as self-preservation after betrayal.\n\nAnother angle: The user was upfront about the paternity test. The ex agreed to it, so there's a mutual understanding. Once the test proves the child isn't theirs, the user's obligation is less clear. The user might also be reacting to the confirmed cheating, which adds emotional trauma. It's possible they feel they can't support a child from someone they no longer trust or are in a relationship with.\n\nBut maybe the user should consider the child's well-being, even if not biologically theirs. If the ex is struggling and her parents are harmful, could the user provide a temporary safe place? The user might not be responsible for the child, but doing so could be an act of compassion. However, the user is also dealing with their own emotional issues and possible financial burdens. They might not have the capacity to take on more, especially if the relationship is over.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. Some people might expect the user to support the child regardless of paternity, while others might see it as the user's right to withdraw support once the test is done. The user's mental health is a factor here. They've been through a lot, and it's valid to prioritize their well-being.\n\nSo, the user isn't legally responsible, but the moral question is more complex. They provided a temporary solution after agreeing to the test, but once the test showed the child wasn't theirs, their obligation (if any) is debatable. The user was in a position where they had to support both financially and emotionally, and the betrayal from cheating could have eroded their willingness to help further. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex's friends are pressuring the user, suggesting societal expectations might be expecting more support. But the user isn't the father, so maybe others overstepping by expecting them to take responsibility. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had and their own circumstances. They made an agreement for a paternity test and followed through. Once the test was done, they can't be expected to support a child they aren't related to. However, there might be a middle ground where offering temporary help if possible, but the user's decision to ask her to leave is understandable given the context.\n"
