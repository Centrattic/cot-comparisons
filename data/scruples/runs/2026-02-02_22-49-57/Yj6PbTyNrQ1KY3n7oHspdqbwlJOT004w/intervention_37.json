It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex-girlfriend out of his house after finding out the child isn't his. They had a two-year relationship, broke up because she was unemployed and he thought she was cheating. After the breakup, she came back when she found out she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave again. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not supporting her and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to take care of them. But ethically, there's a debate. Some might say he should help because he was involved in her life and the pregnancy was initially thought to be his. Others might argue that he's not responsible since he's not the father and he's already been through emotional turmoil.\n\nHe suspected she was cheating, and the paternity test confirmed it, which adds to the betrayal. The ex is now staying with her parents, which have issues, so she's with a friend instead. Friends are pressuring him to take her back. But he feels emotionally drained. \n\nIs he wrong for not wanting to take responsibility for a child that isn't his? If he wasn't the father, then maybe he's not at fault for not supporting the child. However, some might argue that he had a relationship with the mother and should still support her, even if the child isn't his. But others might say he's not responsible for her choices and her current situation is a result of her actions.\n\nAlso, the fact that she cheated on him might be a factor in his decision to end the relationship and not help now. He might feel betrayed and not want to be involved with her anymore. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are within his rights. He's not legally obligated, and he has the right to make his own decisions about his home and emotional state. However, the ethical perspective could go either way. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I think B is the answer here. He's not in the wrong because he's not the father and he's making a choice based on his own circumstances and emotional state.\n"
