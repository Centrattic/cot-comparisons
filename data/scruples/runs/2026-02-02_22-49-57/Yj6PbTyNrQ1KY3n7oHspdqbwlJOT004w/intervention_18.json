It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for kicking out their pregnant ex-girlfriend after a paternity test showed the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship that ended because the ex stopped looking for work and he suspected her of cheating. He broke up with her, she went to live with her parents. Then she came back, told him she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he was wrong. From a legal standpoint, unless there's a prior agreement or a court order, he isn't obligated to support someone else's child. Emotionally, though, it's complicated. He had to support her financially before, which he found burdensome. Now that the child isn't his, he might feel he's not responsible for it. \n\nBut wait, the ex is pregnant, and even if the child isn't his, she's still pregnant. Kicking her out could leave her in a vulnerable position. The author says he agreed to let her stay to protect the child from his ex's smoking. But once the paternity is known, maybe he feels the responsibility isn't his. However, the ex might not be in a stable situation, and he might be abandoning her when she needs support. \n\nThe author is being criticized for not taking care of the child. But since the child isn't his, he's not the legal father. The key is whether he had a prior commitment to support the child regardless of paternity. The story says he agreed to the test, and once it was confirmed, he changed his mind. \n\nThere's also the issue of his emotional state. He feels betrayed, which is understandable. But the ex is now in a situation where she might not have other support. However, he's not obligated to provide it. The author is asking if he's a bad person for not wanting to. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, legally he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. He might be prioritizing his own well-being after betrayal, but the ex is in a tough spot. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the child isn't his, and he didn't commit to support her regardless, maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that once he agreed to let her stay, he should follow through. \n\nBut the core issue is paternity. If the child isn't his, he can't be held responsible. The ex's friends saying he should help the kid anyway might be missing the point that he isn't the father. The author's decision is based on that fact. So, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
