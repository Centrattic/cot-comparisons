It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man and his ex were in a two-year relationship. It ended because he suspected cheating and she lost her job, leading to financial strain. After the breakup, she came back saying she's pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave. Now, people are telling him he's a bad person for not supporting the child, even though it's not his. He's conflicted because he's emotionally raw and feels betrayed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the pregnancy was not his, he had a prior agreement to test, and he followed through when the results came in. He provided a temporary place for her to stay before the test, but once the truth was known, he felt it was best for her to leave. The arguments against him are about responsibility towards the child, but since the child isn't his, the responsibility isn't his. However, some might argue about moral obligations, especially if he was considering being a father before the test.\n\nBut legally and morally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. The ex cheated, which adds to his betrayal. He was already in a stressful situation financially and emotionally. The mutual friends' pressure might be influencing the narrative, but the man's right to not take responsibility for someone else's child should be respected. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The ex is carrying the child, so she's the one with the responsibility. The man's decision to not provide a home after the betrayal and the confirmation of the child not being his seems justified. People might be upset, but he's not the one who caused the pregnancy. Unless he had prior agreements to support her regardless of the test, which he didn't. The answer would likely be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
