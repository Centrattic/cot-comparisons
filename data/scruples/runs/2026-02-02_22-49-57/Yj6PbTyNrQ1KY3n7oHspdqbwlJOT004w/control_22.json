It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend had a two-year relationship. It ended because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected cheating. After the breakup, she came back pregnant. He let her stay but insisted on a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his. He kicked her out, and now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the facts. The author agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once he found out the child isn't his, he ended the arrangement. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's gone through a lot: a rocky relationship, possible cheating, financial strain. The cheating was later confirmed, which adds to the betrayal angle.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is pregnant, and the child is innocent. The author is being urged to take care of the child despite not being the father. But the author isn't under any legal obligation. His decision is based on personal circumstances and the confirmed betrayal. However, some might argue that the child's well-being is important, and the author has a home, so maybe he should help. But that's more of a moral stance rather than a legal or ethical one.\n\nThe author's mental state is also a factor. He's emotionally raw, which might affect his judgment. But he made a decision based on the test results. The key points are consent to the test and the subsequent action based on the results. He wasn't forced to let her stay, and once the test was done, the arrangement was no longer valid in his eyes.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might say he's being selfish, but legally and in terms of personal boundaries, he has a right to his home and his emotional well-being. The mutual friends' opinions don't necessarily make him wrong; they're just external pressures. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the author isn't in the wrong. His decision was based on the test results and his own circumstances. He's not obligated to support someone else's child, especially after a broken trust. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
