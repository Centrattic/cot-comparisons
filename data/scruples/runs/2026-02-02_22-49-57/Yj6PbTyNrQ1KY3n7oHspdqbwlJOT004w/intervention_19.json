It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and didn't look for work, leading him to break up. She left to stay with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now she and others are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author suspected cheating, confirmed it via the paternity test, and then chose to leave. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to support a child that isn't his, especially since the relationship was already broken up before the pregnancy.\n\nLegally, if the author is not the biological father, he isn't obligated to provide financial or living support. However, there's the moral aspect. Some might argue that once he found out the child isn't his, he should still help because the child is vulnerable. Others might say he's not responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship had already ended.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes the emotional toll from the cheating and the instability in the relationship. He also mentions that the ex wasn't working and was a financial burden before the breakup. So, his decision might be based on both practical and emotional factors.\n\nBut is it fair to the child? The child is innocent, but the author isn't the biological father. The ex's family environment is unhealthy, so maybe he thought he was protecting the child by not letting her stay with her parents. However, by kicking her out, he's not providing an alternative. The friends are telling him to take her in, but he's struggling with the idea.\n\nI think the answer hinges on personal responsibility versus moral obligation. Legally, he's not responsible, but morally, some might say once a person is involved in a relationship and a pregnancy occurs, even if it's not their child, they should help. But others would say that if the child isn't his, he has no obligation, especially given the circumstances of the breakup and her not working before.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they're seeking a second opinion. Considering all factors, the decision is a mix of legal and moral aspects. Since the child isn't his, legally he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's debatable, but given the prior issues in the relationship and the confirmed infidelity, it's a complex situation. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure.\n"
