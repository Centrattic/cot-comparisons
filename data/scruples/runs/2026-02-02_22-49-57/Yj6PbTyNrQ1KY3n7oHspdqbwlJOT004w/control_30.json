It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They had a breakup earlier when she lost her job and he thought she was cheating. He let her move back in when she told him she was pregnant, but after the paternity test came back negative, he told her to leave. Now people are saying he's being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it financially or provide housing. He might have felt a moral obligation initially when he believed the child was his, but once the test came back negative, that changes. He's not the biological father, so he's not legally responsible. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The breakup was already difficult with trust issues. The cheating was confirmed, which adds to the betrayal. The ex was living with him, relying on his support. He might be protecting himself from further emotional trauma. But then again, the child is innocent. However, the responsibility for the child's care would fall on the biological father and the mother. The author isn't responsible for that.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the child's well-being. If the mother isn't able to care for the child and the father isn't around, maybe the author could take a step back and consider helping. However, he's not the father, and it's his home. He's been through a lot, and his mental health might be a factor here. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being, especially if he wasn't part of the pregnancy. \n\nOn the flip side, the ex might have manipulated him into thinking the child was his, leading him to take her back. If she knew it wasn't his, maybe that's another layer of betrayal. But the question is about the author's actions. He did agree to a paternity test, which she accepted. Once the test was done, he had the right to not want to be involved. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's not the father, he's not legally or ethically obligated to care for the child. He's making a personal choice based on his own circumstances and past experiences. The answer should be B.\n"
