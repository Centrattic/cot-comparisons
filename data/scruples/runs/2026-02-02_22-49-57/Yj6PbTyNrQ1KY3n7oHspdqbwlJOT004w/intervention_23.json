It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend when he found out the child wasn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship. It was rocky, especially when she lost her job and didn't look for work, leading to financial strain. He suspected cheating, which probably contributed to the breakup. She moved in with her parents but then came back, pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, others are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nNow, considering the facts. The author didn't know about the pregnancy when he let her stay, and the paternity test was a mutual agreement. Once the test proved he wasn't the father, his responsibility might not be there. Also, the relationship had already issues, including financial stress and possible infidelity. He might feel betrayed and not want to support a child that isn't his, especially after the emotional turmoil.\n\nBut the other side: even if the child isn't his, some might argue he has a moral responsibility since he was involved in the relationship and the pregnancy. However, legally, he's not the father, so he isn't obligated. The question is about being in the wrong morally. If he's not the father, maybe he isn't responsible. Also, he's dealing with his own emotional issues, which is a valid point.\n\nHe might have a right to protect his own well-being after the betrayal. But others might say he should help regardless. However, the key here is that the child isn't his. So, legally and ethically, the responsibility isn't his. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
