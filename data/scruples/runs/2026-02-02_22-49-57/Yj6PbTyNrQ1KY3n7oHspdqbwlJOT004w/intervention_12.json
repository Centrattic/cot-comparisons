It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years. The relationship was rocky because she lost her job and didn't look for work, leading the author to financially support both. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay to avoid her mom smoking around the baby. They agreed to a paternity test, which proved the child isn't his. He then asked her to leave, and she's now with friends. People are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo the author is now torn between his emotional state and the pressure to take care of the child. The core issue is whether he made the right decision.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He was already stressed by the breakup, financial strain, and the emotional toll of possible cheating. The paternity test proved he isn't the father, which might have triggered a sense of betrayal (since she might have known earlier or lied). He feels he can't take care of someone else's child in his vulnerable state.\n\nBut others argue he should help. The child is innocent, and maybe the mother is struggling. Also, he had a prior arrangement to let her stay, which he broke after the test. That could make him look unreliable or not trustworthy.\n\nLegally, once the paternity is proven, the author has no legal obligation to support the child. But morally, it's a gray area. The mother is responsible for the child, but if she's in a bad situation (smoking at home, etc.), maybe the author could help. However, he's also dealing with personal trauma and betrayal. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as self-preservation. He had a right to know if he was a father, and once he wasn't, he felt justified in leaving. But some might see him abandoning the mother and child in a time of need, especially if they had agreed to the test upfront.\n\nThe mother's actions could be questionable. She came back with the pregnancy news, maybe expecting support, but then the test shows it's not his. Maybe she was aware earlier and misled him. That could be considered deceitful, which might justify the author's reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the child is innocent. The author might be using the test result as an excuse to avoid the responsibilities he felt when he believed he was a father. However, he wasn't obligated to stay with her regardless of the test outcome. He could have chosen to help her another way if he wanted, but he had the right to decide his own limits.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong if he set the condition of a paternity test and followed through. He isn't legally bound to support the child, and he's prioritizing his own emotional well-being. However, some might argue that once he agreed to let her stay, he had a moral obligation to support her regardless of the test result, especially if he knew the child was in a harmful environment.\n\nBut considering the mutual agreement on the test, and the author's right to his emotional state, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. He had a right to know, and after the test, he made a decision based on his capacity to handle the situation.\n"
