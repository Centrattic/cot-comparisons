It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation carefully. The ex-girlfriend was with him for 2 years. He suspected she was cheating, and they broke up because she wasn't working and was financially dependent on him. Then she came back saying she was pregnant and wanted to stay with him because her mom smokes. He agreed but wanted a paternity test. When the test showed he wasn't the father, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the main points here are: he suspected cheating, which turned out to be true when the paternity test failed. He allowed her to stay under the condition of the test, which she agreed to. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he felt betrayed again and decided she should leave. However, others are pressuring him to help.\n\nLegally, if he isn't the biological father, he isn't obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's been through a tough breakup and possible infidelity, which adds to his stress. The woman might have known he wasn't the father but still asked him to stay, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of responsibility towards the unborn child. Even if he's not the father, if the mother is in need, society might expect him to help. However, he's not legally responsible here. The woman's decision to return to her parents or a friend's house might be her own choice, but she's still seeking his support.\n\nHe's feeling conflicted between his emotional state and societal expectations. His decision to leave her out of his home could be seen as self-preservation after betrayal, but others see it as abandonment. It's a mix of personal ethics and social pressure.\n\nI think he's not in the wrong because he followed through on the agreement he made (paternity test) and acted based on the result. However, there's a moral argument that he could still help, but that's not a legal requirement. The key here is the agreed-upon condition and the outcome. So, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
