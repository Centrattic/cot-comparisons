It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are: the ex-girlfriend lost her job, stopped looking for work, was living with the author, and he suspected her of cheating. They broke up, she left, then came back saying she's pregnant. He let her stay but insisted on a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are calling him a bad person for not supporting her and the child.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI need to consider the facts. The author provided a living arrangement and financial support after the breakup. He agreed to let her stay again under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. The main issue here is whether he's obligated to continue supporting someone else's child.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support them. Emotionally, he's gone through a lot\u2014suspected cheating, the breakup, and the betrayal. He might feel justified in walking away, especially if he's not the biological father.\n\nHowever, there's the argument about moral responsibility. Even if he's not the father, he might have felt connected to the pregnancy before the test. But once the test proves otherwise, his responsibility could be seen as lifted. The ex's friends are pressuring him, which adds social pressure, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Did he have a duty to stay and help regardless of the test? If he had already emotionally invested, does that create a moral obligation? But if the child isn't his, and there's no legal bond, it's more about personal choice. The ex's actions (cheating, financial dependence) might contribute to his decision to leave.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because there's no legal obligation, and he had conditions set. He felt betrayed and needed to protect his own emotional well-being. While some might criticize him, his actions seem reasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
