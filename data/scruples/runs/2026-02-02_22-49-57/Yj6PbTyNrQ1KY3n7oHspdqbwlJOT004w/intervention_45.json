It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author and his ex were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. He ended things because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he suspected cheating. She then came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the paternity test proves he's not the father, then legally he has no obligation to support the child. But maybe there's emotional or moral responsibility? The user says he feels emotionally raw and betrayed. He also confirmed she cheated, which complicates things. \n\nThe friends are telling him he's a terrible person for not taking care of the child. But is he morally responsible? If the child isn't his, and he wasn't involved in the pregnancy, does he have a duty to help? Maybe not. However, sometimes people feel a sense of responsibility even if they're not legally bound. But he's not the father here. \n\nHe allowed her to stay in his house under the condition of the test. Once the test came back negative, he asked her to leave. That seems fair because he had the right to set those boundaries. She was using his home, and he had concerns about his own emotional state and the cheating. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the child's well-being. The author is being criticized for not providing a stable home for the child. However, if he's not the father and the mother is staying with a friend to avoid smoking, maybe there are other resources or support systems she can access. The author isn't obligated to help financially or house her if he's not the father.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The betrayal from cheating and the shock of not being the father might have contributed to his decision. It's important to consider his mental health too. He might need time to process everything.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if he's not the father, he had a relationship with the mother and might feel some responsibility. But legally and ethically, that's not a given. The mother is the one responsible for the child's care, not him, especially if he's not the biological father.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He had the right to make his own decisions based on the test results and his personal circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
