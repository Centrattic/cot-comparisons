It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The ex-girlfriend and the author were together for two years. Things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and broke up with her. She came back saying she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. After the test showed he wasn't the father, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had concerns about her joblessness and possible infidelity, which led him to break up initially. When she returned pregnant, he allowed her to stay under the condition of the paternity test. Once the test proved he wasn't the father, he felt released from responsibility and made her leave. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to provide support. However, the situation is more complex because of their past relationship and the emotional aspects. \n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal and the stress of possibly being a father. His decision to leave might be seen as self-preservation, especially given the cheating and financial strain. But others might argue that he should help regardless of the paternity result, especially since the woman is in a vulnerable state with her parents smoking.\n\nThere's also the social pressure from mutual friends and her friends, labeling him as a bad person. But he's justifying his actions based on the test results and his own emotional state. \n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally and factually, he's not the father, so he's not required to support the child. However, the moral aspect is tricky. Some might say he should help, while others agree with his decision. \n\nGiven that he set a condition for the paternity test and followed through, his actions seem reasonable from his perspective. He's not in the wrong legally, but the moral judgment could go either way. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the user thinks he isn't, but I need to decide based on the information. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the paternity test cleared him, and he made his decision based on that. However, the emotional and social aspects complicate it. But legally and based on the test result, he's not obligated. So, B makes sense.\n"
