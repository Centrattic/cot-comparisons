It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after a paternity test showed the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy was in a 2-year relationship with his ex. Their time together was tough because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, which put a financial strain on him. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, she went to live with her parents. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he tells her to leave. Now, mutual friends are saying he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my input. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, what are the key points here? The man allowed her back into his home under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. The main question is whether he's morally obligated to keep her there regardless. \n\nLegally, he's not the father, so he has no obligation. But ethically? He supported her financially and emotionally during the pregnancy, thinking it was his child. Upon betrayal, he withdraws support. Friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but the child isn't his. The mother is cheating, which is a betrayal. Also, the mother's parents smoke, which is a health concern, but after the test, maybe the friend's house is a better option for her. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once he was involved in supporting her during the pregnancy, he has a responsibility to help, even if he's not the father. But others might say he was right to act when he found out the child isn't his. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The man had no prior knowledge of the pregnancy when he broke up, and he had just ended a relationship marked by cheating and financial stress. The paternity test was a mutual agreement, so she went along with it. After the test, he's justified in not continuing support, especially if he's not the father. The friends' judgment might be based on the idea that he should help the woman regardless, but he's not responsible for a child that's not his. \n\nIn many AITA cases, the decision hinges on intentions and agreements. The man set clear terms: he'd support her under the condition of the test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he's not obligated to keep the arrangement. The woman's friends might not realize that he was trying to protect his own emotional and financial well-being. \n\nOn the flip side, some might say that by allowing her to stay initially, he took on some responsibility, even if the child isn't his. But legally and ethically, the responsibility for the child's care primarily lies with the biological parents. The man is under no obligation to support a child from her cheating. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had the right to set boundaries and made a decision based on the test results, which is fair and reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
