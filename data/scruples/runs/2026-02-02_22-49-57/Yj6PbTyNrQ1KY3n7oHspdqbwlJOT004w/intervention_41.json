It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy and his ex were together for two years. Their relationship was rocky towards the end because she lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected her of cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to move in with her parents. \n\nThen she comes back, pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agrees happily. When the test shows the child isn't his, he kicks her out. Now, friends are telling him he's wrong for not helping the unborn child, considering her parents smoke. He's feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here are paternity, financial responsibility, emotional impact, and the well-being of the unborn child. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot, including the betrayal of cheating. The ex's family environment is unhealthy for the child. \n\nBut there's an ethical angle. Even if the child isn't his, maybe he feels some responsibility because he was led to believe it was his. However, after the test, he's no longer the biological father. The question is whether he has a moral obligation. Some might argue that he should help given the circumstances, but others might say it's not his responsibility. \n\nThe ex's actions are questionable\u2014cheating, not working, then coming back pregnant. The author did agree to a paternity test, which she was happy with, but after the results, he decided to leave. It's possible he felt manipulated or used. \n\nThe friends are pressuring him to take her back for the child's sake. But the author is in a vulnerable emotional state. Legally, he isn't responsible, but morally, there's a debate. However, considering the ex's behavior and the fact that the child isn't his, maybe he's justified in not wanting to be involved. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to step up for children, but if the child isn't biologically his and the mother has a family that's harmful, there's a conflict. But the author isn't the legal father, so he isn't bound by law. The ex's parents smoke, which is bad, but the author isn't responsible for their choices. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on the paternity test and his own emotional well-being. The answer is B.\n"
