It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after discovering the child isn't theirs. The author had a rocky relationship, suspected cheating, broke up, then let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, they asked her to leave. Now others are criticizing him for not helping.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: paternity tests confirm biological relation. If the child isn't his, he isn't legally obligated to support it. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong. But ethically, it's more complex. He provided a home initially when the mother was smoking around her, which he didn't want. Now that the child isn't his, he's under social pressure to keep her. \n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal and feeling overwhelmed. He's had a lot of stress, and the paternity test result might have triggered a sense of betrayal again. However, the key issue is whether he's responsible for the child's well-being now. Since it's not his child, he's not the legal parent. But the mother might still need support, and he's been a part of her life. \n\nBut the scenario says the mother moved back to her parents but stays with a friend to avoid smoke. So she's not in immediate danger. The author's home is offered, but he's feeling that he can't take on the responsibility, given the emotional toll. \n\nSocietal expectations might push him to help, but he's not legally bound. The argument is that he's not in the wrong because he followed through on the paternity test and acted on the results. However, some might argue that he should have considered other options for her, but he did allow her to stay with the caveat of the test. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the information he had. Once the child isn't his, he's not obligated to care for it. So the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong. But the nuance is that while he's not legally wrong, some might judge based on moral grounds. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer would be B.\n"
