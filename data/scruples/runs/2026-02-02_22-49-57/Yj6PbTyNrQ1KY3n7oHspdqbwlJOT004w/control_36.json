It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the situation: He had a girlfriend who got pregnant. He let her move back in with him after she told him about the pregnancy, but they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his. He then kicked her out, and now some friends are telling him he's a bad person for not letting her stay and help with the child.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. The relationship was already rocky before the pregnancy. He suspected cheating and broke up with her, but she moved back in after the pregnancy news. He allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test.\n\n2. The paternity test confirmed he's not the father. He then asked her to leave. \n\n3. He's being criticized for not supporting her and the child now, even though he's not the biological father. His emotional state is mentioned\u2014feeling raw, betrayal from cheating, etc.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since he's not the biological father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. But socially and morally, the situation is more complex. He's being asked to take in someone else's child, which is a big responsibility. However, he was in a relationship with the mother, and maybe felt a connection because he thought he was the father.\n\nBut once the paternity is denied, his responsibility might be seen as less. However, the mother might be in a vulnerable position, and the friends are suggesting he should still help. \n\nOn one hand, he's not the father and felt used or deceived. On the other hand, the child is still a human being in need. But the mother is responsible for the child. The author might feel he was set up to believe he was the father, and after the test, he's not willing to take on the burden. \n\nThe mother might have a responsibility to take care of the child, but if she's in a bad situation (smoking parents), maybe there's a social aspect where the author feels a connection. However, he's not the legal father, so perhaps he's not obligated. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, maybe not legally, but morally? If he was aware of the situation and could help, some might argue he should. However, he was in a relationship that ended with cheating, and this might be a way to cut ties. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key is that the paternity test cleared him, so he's not the father. If he's being asked to support someone else's child, that's a lot to ask. However, maybe he's being selfish, but given the circumstances of the relationship breaking up and the cheating, he might feel justified. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is morally responsible despite not being the biological father. If he had no prior knowledge of the child and just found out it's not his, then kicking her out is understandable. But since he was in a relationship and was led to believe it was his, maybe he's in a grey area. However, once the test is done, his responsibility might end. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's not the father and has the right to set boundaries, especially after the cheating and the previous breakup.\n"
