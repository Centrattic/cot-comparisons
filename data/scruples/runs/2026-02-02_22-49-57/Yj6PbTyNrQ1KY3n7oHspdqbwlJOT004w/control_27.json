It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years but broke up because she lost her job and wasn't working, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and ended it. She came back pregnant, he let her stay but insisted on a paternity test. After the test showed he's not the father, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's being cruel to the unborn child.\n\nHmm. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, there's more to it. He was in a relationship, believed the child was his, and agreed to support them. Now that it's not his, he's not legally responsible. However, if he had been involved and provided support before the test, maybe there's an expectation of continued support. But in this case, he only agreed after the pregnancy was confirmed and the paternity test was done. \n\nHe mentions he felt betrayed because she cheated. That's a huge emotional aspect. If she cheated, that's a separate issue. But the main question is about the unborn child. He's in a vulnerable time emotionally and doesn't want to take care of the child. Is he wrong to prioritize his own well-being?\n\nOn one hand, he's not the father, so he's not obligated. On the other, if he had accepted the responsibility before knowing the child wasn't his, maybe he's expected to follow through. But in the story, he had the test done first. He set boundaries from the start. After finding out it's not his, he's within his rights to withdraw. \n\nOthers are pressuring him to take care of the child regardless. But he's not the father. The woman might need help, but he's not responsible. Unless there's some legal or moral obligation beyond biology, which varies. If he was in a committed relationship and the child was thought to be his, maybe there's an argument there. But since he checked the paternity first, he's not legally bound. \n\nHe's also dealing with emotional trauma from the breakup and cheating. Prioritizing his mental health is understandable. So, is he in the wrong? If the answer is about legal and ethical obligations, he's not in the wrong. But if the question is about moral responsibility despite not being the father, maybe yes. But the key point is he had the test done and isn't the biological father. So, he's not the wronged father here. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
