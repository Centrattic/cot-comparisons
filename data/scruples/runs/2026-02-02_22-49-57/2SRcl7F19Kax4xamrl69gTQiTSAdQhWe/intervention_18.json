It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's still single. The author's friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments over two years, including body-shaming and questioning her dating success. The author finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her struggles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior has been ongoing and insulting for two years. The author has tried to brush it off, giving polite responses. The final response was a direct and honest answer, which the author believes is the truth. The friend reacted negatively, leading to mutual friends criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the friend's insults versus the author's response. The author's statement was factual but could be seen as pointing out a sensitive truth. However, delivering that truth in a direct way might have been perceived as harsh, especially given the long history of insults. The mutual friends' reactions suggest they feel the author crossed a line, even if the statement was true.\n\nI should also consider if there was a better way to handle it. The author might have wanted to set a boundary after being insulted repeatedly. But using the friend's own situation as a counter could come off as cutting, even if it's honest. The question is whether honesty justifies the method, considering the impact on the friendship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author was responding to ongoing insults, which is understandable. However, the response might have been too direct and triggered defensiveness. The author's intentions were to be truthful and stop the insults, but the delivery might have been unkind. The mutual friends' criticism is about the author's approach, not the truth itself.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for speaking the truth, but maybe the way they said it could have been more compassionate. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong at all. Given the context of repeated insults and the author's attempt to set boundaries, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The key is that the author was defending themselves after being attacked, even if the response was harsh.\n"
