It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple kids with different fathers is why she's having trouble finding dates.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making personal insults for two years, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off with generic responses. Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation. The friend reacted angrily, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the insults and the author's response. The friend's comments were not just casual but targeted and personal. The author's response was factual, pointing out a real-life challenge that having multiple children with different fathers might present in dating. \n\nHowever, even though the author's statement is true, the way they delivered it might have come across as harsh or dismissive. The friend might have felt blamed instead of supported. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that they felt the comment was insensitive or judgmental.\n\nBut considering the two-year history of insults and the author's attempts to be polite before, it's possible that the author had a right to set boundaries. The advice given was honest and based on reality, even if it was direct. The author's own situation (having two kids with the same dad) contrasts with the friend's, which might explain why the friend's approach is complicating her dating life.\n\nSo, while the method might be questionable, the author's intent was to be truthful and stop enduring the insults. The question is whether honesty in this context justifies the response. Since the friend was also making personal attacks, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
