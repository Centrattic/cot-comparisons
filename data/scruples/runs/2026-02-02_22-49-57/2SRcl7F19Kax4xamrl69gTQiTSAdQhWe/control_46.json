It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been divorced five times, each time with different fathers, and now the friend is asking the author questions that come off as insulting. The author has been brushing them off but finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the five kids and no child support. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are saying the author was wrong and that they have \"skinny privilege\" and are entitled.\n\nHmm, the key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's comments were clearly mean and personal, attacking the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to be supportive but eventually snapped. The response about the five kids and child support is a factual point, but is bringing that up appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves after being insulted repeatedly. They might feel justified in pointing out the reason why the friend is struggling to find a partner. However, bringing up the number of children and the absence of child support might be a sensitive topic. Even if it's true, it could be perceived as judgmental or hurtful, especially if the friend is already in a vulnerable place. \n\nThe mutual friends think the author was wrong and used \"privilege,\" but the author argues they've worked hard and aren't entitled. It's a bit of a gray area. The friend's behavior was definitely inappropriate, but the author's response might have crossed a line. Maybe there was a better way to address it without being so direct. But since the friend was attacking the author, the author might feel they had the right to respond. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were responding to ongoing insults and trying to give a truthful answer. However, maybe the delivery was harsh. But given the context of being insulted, the author's response was in self-defense. So, probably the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
