It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making hurtful comments towards the author for two years, about her weight, job, and dating life. The author kept brushing it off, but finally snapped by pointing out the friend's five kids with different dads as a reason she's single. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is in the wrong, mentioning things like skinny privilege, entitlement, and being a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend was being insulting repeatedly, the author responded with what they believe is the truth, but others are criticizing the author. The question is whether the author's response was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves against two years of insults. They might feel justified in pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her struggles. But on the other hand, bringing up someone's personal issues, especially as a reason for their personal failures, can be hurtful. Even if it's true, it might not be the right way to address the problem. Also, the author's job in the adult industry adds complexity, as mutual friends might have different views on that, possibly contributing to their judgment of the author.\n\nThe friend's behavior was clearly toxic, making untrue and low-quality insults. However, the author's response might have been a direct attack that's hard for the friend to hear, even if it's true. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was harsh and not well-received, possibly contributing to the friend's current situation.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The initial insults from the friend were the root cause. The author might have been within their right to respond when they felt attacked. However, the way they responded might have been tactless. Maybe there was a better way to address the friend's behavior without pointing out her personal flaws. The friends' criticism about the author's privilege might be part of the reason they're not seeing the author's side, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. It's a complex social situation where both parties have valid points, but the author's response was a direct truth that the friend wasn't ready to hear. \n\nSo, considering that the author was defending themselves after repeated attacks, but their response might have been too harsh, perhaps the answer is a bit of both. However, according to the user's instructions, the answer needs to be either A or B. Given that the author was trying to be honest in response to provocation, but their method might have been inappropriate, it's a tough call. However, since the friends are pointing out the author's privilege and entitlement, maybe the author's response was seen as cutting, especially in a sensitive area. In social dynamics, even if true, pointing out someone's personal issues in a way that's critical can be seen as wrong. So, maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nThe friend's behavior was the initial problem, and the author was defending themselves. The author's response was a factual observation about the friend's situation. However, it's possible that the author crossed a line by directly linking the friend's personal choices to her current problems, which can come off as judgmental. In such cases, even if true, it's often better to use \"I\" statements or avoid making direct accusations. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle it delicately enough. Therefore, Answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) might be correct.\n"
