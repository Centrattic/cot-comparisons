It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's single. The friend was making hurtful comments, and the author finally snapped with the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of making insults that target the author's appearance, work, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off but eventually responded with their honest opinion. \n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was clearly abusive and insincere, but does that give the author the right to call out her situation? The author's comment points out a factual issue that the friend is facing\u2014multiple children with different fathers and no child support. That could be a legitimate reason why someone might be hesitant to date her, but the author frames it as the reason, which might be oversimplifying her situation. \n\nThe author's friends are now saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is being entitled. That's a common reaction when someone from a different background makes a judgment. The author's response was direct and truthful, which they felt was necessary after being insulted. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, especially after so many years of putting up with the insults. \n\nI should also consider if there was a better way to respond. The author could have addressed the friend's actions without pointing out her personal situation in such a direct manner. That might have been more constructive. But given the friend's history of belittling, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They were being insulted and finally stood up for themselves, but their response might have been tactless. The friend's actions were wrong, but the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they were defending themselves against a friend who had been persistently cruel. However, the method could have been improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their method was optimal. So, the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that the response could have been handled better.\n"
