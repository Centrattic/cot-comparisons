It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their friend the truth about why she's still single. The friend has five kids with different fathers and no child support, and she's been making snarky comments about the author. The author finally responds honestly, which caused a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend made a lot of personal, possibly hurtful comments. The author tried to brush them off but eventually decided to address the root cause of her friend's situation. The response was direct and factual, pointing out the child support issue as a barrier to finding a partner. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend started the toxic behavior with insults. The author's response, while blunt, was a truth that the friend might be ignoring. But delivering that truth in a direct way might have come off as harsh, even if it's accurate. However, the friend's behavior was ongoing and harmful, so maybe the author had a right to respond. \n\nBut the author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, and mutual friends are calling them privileged. The author argues they're not. That adds complexity. The friend's issues are real, but her behavior was also toxic. The author's response was a factual statement, not an insult, but it's possible they could have phrased it more sensitively. \n\nStill, the friend's prior actions were disrespectful. The author was defending themselves by pointing out the friend's own issues. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were addressing a valid point, albeit in a direct way. Alternatively, the method could have been better, but the content wasn't malicious. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but with a note about the delivery.\n"
