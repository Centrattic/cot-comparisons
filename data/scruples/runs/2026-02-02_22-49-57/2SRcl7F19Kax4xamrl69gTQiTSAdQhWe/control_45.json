It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their friend has five kids with different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The friend has been insulting the author about her own dating life and job. The author finally snaps and tells the friend that her situation with multiple kids and no support is making it hard for her to find someone. The friend gets angry, and now the author is getting backlash from mutual friends, who say the author was privileged and shouldn't have said that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author has been brushing them off. The author's response was a direct answer to the friend's question, pointing out the possible reason for her difficulties. The key here is whether the author's response was a valid and appropriate reply to the friend's questions.\n\nThe friend's comments seem to be filled with jealousy and insults, implying that the author is somehow \"better\" because she has a partner and kids. The author's job in the adult industry is a sensitive topic, and the friend's mockery of it might be a way to deflect from her own issues. The author's response directly addresses the friend's situation, which is a factual observation. However, even if true, the way it's delivered might be harsh, especially after a long history of passive-aggressive comments.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The friend was the one initiating the insults and making the author the target. The author's response was a truth she felt was necessary to share. The mutual friends are criticizing the author for not understanding \"privilege,\" but the author is defending her hard work. The question is whether the author overstepped by pointing out a real issue that the friend was facing.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's often considered unkind to point out someone's flaws, even if they're true, especially if the person is already struggling. However, the author had been the target of the friend's negativity for a long time. The friend's question was direct, and the author's answer was a factual response. The author might have been justified in calling out the friend's situation, but the method and timing could be seen as harsh. The friend's subsequent anger might be a result of feeling attacked, which the author had been enduring for two years.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's response was a direct answer to a question, even if it was delivered in a moment of frustration. The friend's behavior was the root issue, and the author was responding truthfully. The mutual friends' reactions might be a case of not seeing the entire context of the two years of insults. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. But there's a nuance in how to handle such situations. Maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better, but the core issue was the friend's behavior. So the answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong."
