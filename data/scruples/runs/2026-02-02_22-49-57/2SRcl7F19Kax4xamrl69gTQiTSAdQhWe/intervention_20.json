It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend was being insulting and making comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a lot of hurtful and untrue comments over two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses but finally responded with the truth about the friend's situation. The author's intention was to point out a real issue that might be affecting the friend's ability to find a partner. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author was defending themselves from insults and pointing out a factual situation that could impact the friend's dating life. On the other hand, the way the author chose to address it might have come off as harsh, even if true. \n\nBut the friend had a history of making low-quality insults, and the author was tired of being insulted. The friend's actions, like having multiple kids with different fathers and not getting child support, are real factors that could make it hard for someone to find a partner. The author's response was honest, though it might not have been delivered with the most tact. However, given the friend's behavior over two years, some might see it as justified. \n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the author, but they might not fully understand the context. The author's job in the adult industry is a sensitive topic, and the friend's insults there could be especially hurtful. The author's response was a truthful reflection of the situation, even if it led to conflict. \n\nSo, considering the history of insults and the author's attempt to address a real issue, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
