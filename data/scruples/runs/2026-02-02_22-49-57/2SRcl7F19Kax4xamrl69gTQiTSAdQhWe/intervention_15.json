It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are affecting her chances of finding a partner. The context is that the friend has been making insulting comments about the author for two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend has been persistently making hurtful remarks, which the author has been trying to brush off. The author's response directly addresses the friend's situation, pointing out something the friend might be aware of but not addressing. The key here is whether the author's response was justified given the provocation.\n\nThe author mentions that their friend has five children with different fathers and none of the fathers pay child support. The author's comment is that this situation makes it hard to find a partner. This is a factual observation, as potential partners might be concerned about taking on financial responsibilities without being part of the children's lives. However, the delivery was during an argument, and it's possible that the author's frustration made the comment come off as harsher than intended.\n\nNow, looking at the mutual friends' reactions, they accuse the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author works in the adult industry and has an MBA, which might contribute to others perceiving them as having advantages. However, the author feels they've worked hard and aren't privileged. The friends might be defending the friend out of loyalty, so their judgment could be biased.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the insults by addressing the root cause they believed was hindering the friend's dating life. While the truth can be hurtful, especially in a sensitive topic like this, the author might have considered that the friend wasn't aware of the impact of her actions. However, a more constructive approach, like expressing concern without blaming, might have been better. For example, suggesting ways to improve her situation without pointing out her children's fathers.\n\nBut the friend was already being critical and the author was tired of the insults. In that context, the author's response was a direct but honest reaction to protect themselves. The real issue is whether the comment was a valid response to the friend's behavior. Since the friend was attacking the author, and the author was defending themselves by pointing out the obvious, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's comment was a direct cause of the friend's anger, so maybe the author should have found a different way to convey the message without being so blunt during a heated moment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was definitely toxic, the author's response might have been a valid attempt to set a boundary. However, the delivery and the content of the message could be seen as crossing a line, especially since it's a sensitive topic. So, the author might be partially at fault for not handling it more delicately.\n"
