It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is divorced five times. For two years, this friend has been asking the author questions that the author feels are insults. Examples include comments about the author's weight, implying she's only dating because she's skinny, and questioning her work in the adult industry. The author has tried to brush off these comments with responses like \"you're in a small town\" or to focus on herself. Finally, the friend asks again, and the author replies honestly that her situation with five kids and no child support might make it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets angry, hangs up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and not understanding her friend's struggles. The author is upset, feeling that she's worked hard and is not entitled, and she's also defending her work in the adult industry, which her friend has mocked.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was in the wrong for being honest and pointing out her friend's issues. Let's consider the possible angles. \n\nFirst, the friend's behavior: she's been making repeated, personal, and potentially hurtful comments over two years. The author tried to ignore them and give vague advice. But when pushed, they gave a direct response about the friend's situation. The friend then reacted negatively. \n\nNow, the friend's actions might be problematic. Making constant, insulting remarks about someone's appearance, job, and relationships could be seen as toxic and unkind. The author's response, while direct, is pointing out a factual aspect of the friend's life that could be affecting her dating prospects. The friend's five children with different fathers and lack of child support is a real challenge that many people might find difficult to navigate, especially when seeking a new partner. The author's comment was meant to highlight that reality, which is the core of her friend's situation. \n\nHowever, the way the author delivered the message could be seen as harsh. Even if the friend was being mean, confronting someone with a blunt truth about their personal failures might not be the best approach. The author could have been more empathetic, perhaps acknowledging the difficulty of the friend's situation before offering the honest assessment. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment might have been perceived as judgmental or privileged. The author mentions working hard and having a stable job and MBA, which might be contrasted with her friend's struggles. But the friend's issues are more about her personal choices and circumstances, not about privilege in terms of socioeconomic background. The author might not be \"entitled\" in the traditional sense, but the comment could have come off as dismissive of the friend's feelings, even if it's objectively true. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend's behavior was likely the root problem, but the author's response could have been more tactful. The key here is whether the author's comment was a justified response to the friend's ongoing insults or if it was an overstep. \n\nSince the friend was asking for advice and the author provided a truthful, albeit blunt, response about the friend's situation, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the manner in which it was delivered could have contributed to the friend's negative reaction. The author's intent was to be honest, but the impact was hurtful. \n\nIn conflict resolution, it's often about both the content and the delivery. The author's content is valid, but the delivery might have been lacking in empathy. So, while the friend was being mean, the author's response might still be seen as the wrong approach because it was direct and potentially hurtful without considering the friend's feelings. The mutual friends are reacting to the author's comment as if it was an insult, which it might have been, even if it was based on truth. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they delivered the message, even if the message itself had merit. The better approach would have been to address the friend's issues with kindness and support, perhaps offering a different perspective without being critical. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the response was a direct, blunt truth that could be seen as hurtful, even if the friend's behavior was the initial problem.\n"
