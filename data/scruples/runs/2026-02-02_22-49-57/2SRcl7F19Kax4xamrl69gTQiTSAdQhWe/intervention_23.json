It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has gone through five divorces and has five kids with different fathers. The friend keeps making comments to the author that come off as insults, questioning why the author has a partner and kids when she (the friend) doesn't. The author tried to brush off these comments for two years, giving vague advice. Then, when the friend asked again, the author responded by pointing out the friend's situation with the kids and lack of child support as a possible reason. The friend got angry and hung up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and insinuating that the author's success in relationships (or perceived success) was due to superficial reasons like being skinny or more attractive. The author, feeling attacked, responded with what they believe is the truth: the friend's situation with multiple kids from different fathers might make it harder to find someone. \n\nBut is pointing out that truth okay? The friend's behavior included insults and passive-aggressive questions, which the author tried to handle politely. However, when the author finally responded with the truth, it caused a fallout. The friends are now taking sides against the author, saying they're privileged and not understanding the friend's struggles. \n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves after being insulted. They have their own valid reasons for feeling targeted. On the other hand, the author's response was direct and possibly hurtful, even if true. The line between giving honest feedback and being cruel can be thin. The author might have been justified in feeling defensive, but the way they communicated it could have been more empathetic.\n\nThe friend's actions included repeated insults, which is part of the problem. The author's response, while honest, might have been the trigger that ended the friendship, but it was in response to years of one-sided interactions where the author felt attacked. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend's behavior was problematic and the insults were unwarranted. The author's response was a direct consequence of being pushed too far. While the author's truth might be valid, the delivery could have been more tactful. However, the main issue is that the friend was the one making the insults, and the author was finally asserting themselves. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They were responding to ongoing issues. But maybe there was a better way to approach it. Still, the fault lies more with the friend for the initial insults and the author's response was a reaction to that. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
