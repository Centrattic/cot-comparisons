It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids by different fathers is why she's still single. The friend made a lot of insults over two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend kept asking personal and insulting questions about the author's dating life, implying that the author's success is due to being skinny or other superficial traits. The author felt they were being attacked and finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation with multiple children and no child support, which might make it hard to find a partner.\n\nThe author's response was direct and honest, but it led to conflict. The mutual friends are now saying the author is privileged and shouldn't have said that. The author feels they were just telling the truth and defending themselves after being insulted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend was being rude and making the author uncomfortable for a long time. The author might have felt justified in pointing out the friend's own issues as the reason for her situation. However, even if the friend was being mean, does that make it okay for the author to respond with a personal attack on her parenting and exes?\n\nI think the key here is how to handle situations where someone is being hurtful. The author tried to brush it off for two years, which is a long time. But when they finally responded, they targeted the friend's personal life, which could be seen as cutting off the conversation and escalating the conflict. Even if the underlying reason is true (that having multiple children with different fathers might affect dating), pointing it out in that way could come off as harsh and judgmental.\n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry was insulted by the friend, which the author might have felt was unfair. But responding with a personal truth might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe a better approach would have been to set boundaries without attacking the friend's personal life, even if the friend was being difficult.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author was defending themselves after being insulted, which is understandable. But the way they responded might have crossed a line by targeting sensitive personal information about their friend. While the friend's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response could be seen as equally hurtful, hence why the mutual friends are criticizing them. So, maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong for how they chose to respond, even if the friend was the initial aggressor. So I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong)."
