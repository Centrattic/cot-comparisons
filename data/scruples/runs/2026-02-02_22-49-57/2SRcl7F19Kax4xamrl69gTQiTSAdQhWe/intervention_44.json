It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been divorced five times, each with different fathers, and the author is a friend who's had a different life path. The friend has been making snide comments and insults about the author's dating life and job. The author, after two years of brushing off these insults, finally tells her that her situation with the five kids from different dads might be a barrier to finding a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and untrue. The author tried to be polite before, giving advice like \"focus on yourself.\" When the insults continued, the author decided to be honest. The response points out a fact that the friend is aware of: having five children with different fathers without child support could make it hard for someone to commit. \n\nIs that a valid point? Well, it's a sensitive topic. People might have different views on whether that's a legitimate reason. However, the author isn't making a judgment about the friend's choices but pointing out a potential reality. The friend's behavior was mean, so the author's response was in self-defense of sorts. \n\nThe mutual friends are side-eyeing the author, saying things like \"skinny privilege\" and that the author is entitled. But the author mentions they work hard, have an MBA, and a second job. The author's job in the adult industry might be stigmatized, making the friend's comments more hurtful. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response crossed a line. The friend had been insulting the author for two years. The author's response was factual and not an insult but a direct answer. Even if the mutual friends disagree, the author's intent was to be truthful, not malicious. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They stood up for themselves after enduring hurtful comments and provided a truthful answer when asked directly. The friend's reaction was over the top, but the author's response was justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
