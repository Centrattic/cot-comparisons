It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has been making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out that the friend's multiple children with different fathers might be affecting her dating life. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of making personal, hurtful remarks about the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author has been brushing these off for two years, which is a long time. The final comment the author made was about the friend's situation, which is factual (five kids with different dads, no support), but it's a sensitive topic. \n\nThe key points here are the ongoing insults and the author's response. The author's statement was honest, but it's a direct accusation that could be seen as judgmental. Even if the author's intention was to point out a valid issue, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The friend was already defensive and prone to insults, so the author's response might have been the last straw. \n\nNow, mutual friends are calling the author privileged and a bad friend. The author feels they're not getting support and that their hard work is being ignored. However, the friends might be reacting to the content of the comment, which touches on sensitive topics like child support and relationship issues. Even if the statement is true, bringing up someone's personal life in a confrontational way can be seen as crossing a line, especially after the friend has been making her own insults.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the friend was being rude and the author had a right to defend themselves. On the other hand, the response was a direct attack on the friend's personal circumstances, which might not be the best approach, even if it's true. There might have been a more constructive way to communicate the same point without attacking the friend's choices. \n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry is mentioned. The friend has also tried that job, so maybe there's a history there. The author's work in that field might be a sensitive topic, so bringing up the friend's child support issues could be seen as adding salt to the wound, especially if the friend is already struggling with self-esteem issues.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if the friend was at fault for the insults, the author's response could be seen as the final act that ended the friendship. The friends might be taking the side of the friend who has been the victim of ongoing insults, but their reaction to the author's comment might be influenced by their perception of the situation. The author's comment could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation or as a valid but harsh truth.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to address the insults. By pointing out the friend's situation, the author might have been trying to call out the root of the problem, but it might have come across as judgmental. The author could have been hurt and finally snapped, which is understandable, but the method of response might not have been the best. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is somewhat in the wrong because even though the friend was insulting, the response was a direct attack on a sensitive personal issue. It's possible that there was a better, more empathetic way to address the friend's behavior without making a pointed comment about her circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
