It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for telling their friend that she's still single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the user finally snapped by pointing out the friend's situation. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the user for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, which the user denies.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user's response was justified. The friend's comments were clearly personal and hurtful, targeting the user's weight, job, and dating life. The user tried to brush off the insults previously, offering advice like focusing on oneself. When the friend became aggressive again, the user responded with the truth about her having five kids with different dads. But the friend took it as an insult, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the insults and the user's response. The friend's remarks were not just questions but were framed as taunts and sleights. The user's reply was factual but might have come across as judgmental. Even if the user believes it's the truth, delivering it in a way that's direct and potentially hurtful in the context of a friendship might not be the best approach. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that they felt the user's comment was harsh, especially pointing out the friend's child support situation. While the user's intention was to be honest, the manner and context of the statement could have been unkind. The user mentions that their friend had also tried the same job, which the user says is untrue, but that's a separate issue.\n\nConsidering the dynamics, the user was in a position where their friend was being hostile, but responding with a personal truth might not have been the right way to handle it. The user's response could be seen as crossing the line from defending themselves to attacking the friend's personal life, which can be hurtful regardless of the truth. So, the user might be in the right for standing up to the insults, but their delivery could have been more tactful. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer depends on the perception of the response's appropriateness. The user's reply was factual but delivered in a way that caused the friend to react strongly. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for how they expressed the truth instead of the truth itself.\n"
