It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of insulting the author for two years, making comments about their weight, job, and dating life. The author kept brushing it off, but then finally responded with the truth about the friend's situation. The friend took it as an insult, got angry, and now mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and untrue. The author's response was pointing out a factual reason (the five kids with different fathers) as a potential barrier to dating. But was that the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves after enduring two years of insults. The response was honest, and the author's own situation (two kids with the same dad, working in a certain industry, etc.) contrasts with the friend's. The author might feel that the friend's comments were unfair, so they called out the actual issue.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the author's statement is factually true, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. Friends are supposed to support each other, and directly pointing out someone's flaws, even if true, can be seen as judgmental. The friend is in a tough spot with multiple children and custody issues, and the author's comment, while factual, might not have been the most compassionate or constructive way to handle it.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that they think the author could have handled it differently. The author might have been better off setting boundaries without making a direct accusation. Maybe a more empathetic approach, like acknowledging the friend's struggles but also explaining that their behavior is hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were defending themselves after repeated insults. However, the way they handled it could have been more tactful. The key is whether the response was a justified defense or crossing a line. Since the friend had a history of insults, the author's frustration is understandable, but the response might not have been the best approach. So, the author is in the wrong for how they handled it, because even though the friend was rude, a more constructive response might have been better. So answer A."
