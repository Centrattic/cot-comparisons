It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids by different fathers is why she's still single. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally responded with the truth. Now mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and crossed into personal insults, like questioning the author's weight, implying they only have dates because of their looks, and commenting on their job. The author tried to brush these off for two years. When the friend kept asking the same questions, the author finally responded with the truth about the friend's situation. The friend then reacted negatively, and now the author is facing backlash from mutual friends.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the nature of the insults and the appropriateness of the response. The friend's behavior was persistent and unkind. The author's response was factual but also points out a sensitive issue about the friend's life choices. The author is in a different situation with two kids by the same father and a stable arrangement. The friend's comments also targeted the author's job, which the friend tried herself. \n\nThe friends are saying the author is privileged and being entitled. But the author argues they've worked hard and aren't privileged. The question is whether pointing out the friend's situation was a valid response or if it crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while honesty can be important, the way it's delivered matters. The author's response was direct and addressed a real issue that the friend might be facing. However, it's also possible that the author's comment was a bit harsh, even if truthful. The friend was already in a vulnerable position, and the author's comment could be seen as adding insult to injury. \n\nBut the friend had been making the first move with insults, so the author's response might be seen as a justified pushback. The mutual friends might be reacting from a place of not seeing the two years of insults, only the final comment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author was responding to ongoing hurtful comments. The response was a factual statement that might be the root of the friend's issues. The author's intent was to be honest, not to attack, but the friend took it that way. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to a long pattern of behavior, and their comment was a truthful observation that the friend might need to hear. The friends' reactions might be missing the context of the two years of insults. So the answer is B."
