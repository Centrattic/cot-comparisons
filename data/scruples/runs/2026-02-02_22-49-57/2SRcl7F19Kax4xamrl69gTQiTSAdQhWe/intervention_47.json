It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author had a friend who went through five divorces, each with different fathers for her kids, and none of them pay child support. The friend has been making hurtful comments about the author for two years, like implying she's only getting dates because she's skinny or a blonde, which the author clarifies isn't true. The author tried to brush off the insults with advice, but finally told the friend that her situation (five kids by different dads without child support) was likely why she's having trouble finding someone. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong, that she has \"skinny privilege\" and is privileged in general.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were not just questions but insults, which the author had been ignoring. The author's response was direct and called out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her single status. The key here is whether the author crossed a line by pointing out the friend's situation, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nThe author's intention was to be honest and stop the cycle of insults. However, the friend's situation is personal and potentially painful. The author's statement might have been true but delivered in a way that could be perceived as judgmental. The friend's reaction suggests that she felt attacked, which is understandable if the comment was meant to highlight her struggles rather than offer support.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that her friend had tried to do the same job and the author works part-time in the adult industry, making good money. The author's financial situation is better, which mutual friends are pointing out as \"privilege.\" But the author argues she worked hard and isn't privileged. However, the concept of \"privilege\" isn't about how hard one works but about systemic advantages. The author might have social or economic advantages compared to her friend, which the mutual friends are highlighting.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's response was a justified defense against ongoing insults or if it was an overstep. While the author was responding to two years of insults, the way she addressed it might have been too harsh. The friend's situation is complex, and pointing out the child support issue could have been a truth but also a sensitive topic. The author might have needed a different approach, like setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal life.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because she was responding to ongoing harassment, but the method could be questioned. However, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was hurtful. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she was finally standing up for herself, though the better approach might have been to set boundaries without attacking the friend's issues directly.\n"
