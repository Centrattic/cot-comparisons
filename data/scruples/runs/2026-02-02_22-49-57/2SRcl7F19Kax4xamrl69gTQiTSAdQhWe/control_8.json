It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who has five kids with different fathers and keeps making hurtful comments to the author. The author finally tells her that her situation might be making it hard to find someone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is divorced five times, two years ago, and has been asking questions that insult the author. The author has been trying to brush them off with comments about the friend's environment or encouraging her to focus on herself. Then, when the friend keeps being harsh, the author responds by pointing out her friend's five kids with different dads and no child support. The friend takes offense and hangs up.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged and is a bad friend. The author feels wronged, thinking they were just speaking the truth and that they've worked hard for their life.\n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The author's friend was making personal, untrue insults. The author's response was a direct answer to why the friend might be having trouble finding dates. The friend's situation is indeed complicated, but the author's statement might come across as judgmental. Even if it's true, pointing out someone's personal issues in response to their insults can be seen as attacking rather than supporting. The author's intention was to give honest feedback, but the way it was delivered could have been harsh. Friends might argue that the author should have handled it more sensitively instead of directly blaming the friend's past actions. The concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) usually hinges on the tone and approach, not just the truth. So, even if the author's statement is accurate, the method of responding might be considered inconsiderate or unkind, hence in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's a nuance. Wait, but the friend was already being insulting, so maybe the author was just defending themselves. However, the author's response might have escalated the situation. The key is whether the truth was said in a respectful way. Since the author's advice was blunt and could be seen as shaming, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the author had the right to be honest, but the way they phrased it was hurtful. So, even if the friend was being an asshole, the author's reply could be seen as equally unkind. The mutual friends are on the friend's side, which suggests that the author's comment crossed a line. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
