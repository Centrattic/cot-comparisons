It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, their friend has five kids with different fathers and is still single, and the friend has been asking the author questions that the author considers insults. The friend's comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life seem to be personal attacks. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the five kids and no child support, which makes the friend angry and cuts off communication. Now the mutual friends are blaming the author, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author mentions they've been brushing off the insults for two years, which is a long time. The friend's behavior seems to be pattern of attacking the author instead of addressing her own issues. The author's response was direct and honest, pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her difficulties in finding a partner. \n\nBut is that fair? The author says it's the truth. However, even if it's true, the way it's delivered might be hurtful. The friend's question was about why the author can get dates while she can't, and the author's answer is a bit of a backhanded jab. The friend has been using insults, so the author's response could be seen as a form of self-defense or standing up for themselves. However, the mutual friends think the author is being privileged and not understanding the friend's struggles. \n\nWait, the author works in the adult industry, which might be contributing to their \"skinny privilege\" comments from others. The friend's comments about the author's job also come into play here. The author's job might be a sensitive topic, and even though they work hard, others might not acknowledge that due to societal stigmas. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a proportionate reaction to the friend's ongoing insults. The author had been trying to be supportive all this time, but the friend kept attacking. The author's answer was factual but perhaps not delivered with empathy. The friend might be in a difficult situation, dealing with multiple divorces and the stigma around that, so the author's comment might have been a trigger. \n\nAlso, the friend's behavior seems to be more about deflecting her own issues onto the author. The author's response was pointing out the reality the friend is facing, which is that having five kids with different fathers could be a challenge in finding a stable partner. But is it the author's place to say that? Maybe the friend is already aware but doesn't want to confront it, so the author's comment felt like a betrayal. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that even if the author's comment was true, it could be seen as insensitive. Friends might expect support even if their behavior isn't ideal. The author might have been justified in wanting to stop the insults, but the way they responded might have crossed a line. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was constantly attacking the author, it's possible that the author's response was a legitimate stand up for their own dignity. The problem is that the author's response could be perceived as judgmental, even if it's based on truth. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The friend's behavior was definitely inappropriate, but the author's response, while honest, might not have been the best approach. Maybe a better way to handle it would be to set boundaries earlier, like not engaging in the insults and clearly stating that they don't want to be insulted. But since the friend kept pushing, the author might have felt cornered. \n\nThe mutual friends are saying the author is privileged, which might be a reflection of how the comment came across, regardless of the author's intentions. The author's job in the adult industry could be a point of sensitivity, and others might not recognize the effort involved. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's response was truthful but perhaps not the most compassionate or supportive way to address the issue. Since the friend was already in a sensitive state, the author's directness might have been too harsh, especially after years of trying to be a good friend. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the friend's behavior was so toxic that the author needed to call it out, maybe B (not in the wrong). But society often frowns on such direct honesty in friendships, so the author's approach could be seen as unkind. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author told the truth in a way that the friend found hurtful. Even if the friend was being an insufferable critic, the author's response could be seen as a valid point but delivered without tact. The friend's reaction was to go into insult fury and hang up, which is her own overreaction. But the author's answer was a factual reason for the friend's difficulty, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nI think the answer is A because even though the friend was being rude, the author's response was a personal attack on the friend's situation rather than a refusal to engage. Friends are supposed to support each other, and the author's response, while true, might have been too harsh. The author could have addressed it differently, like saying they don't want to discuss it anymore and set a boundary without insinuating the friend's choices are the problem. So they might be in the wrong for not handling it more constructively.\n"
