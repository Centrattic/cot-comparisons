It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's still single. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the author finally snapped with what they thought was the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and made the author uncomfortable. The author replied with their own truth, which was about the friend's child support and seeking a father figure. The friend then became angry and hung up. Mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up such a sensitive topic. Even if the friend was being hurtful, the author's response might have been too direct or harsh. Friends often have boundaries, and discussing someone's personal life, especially in a judgmental way, can be crossing a line. The author's comment about the friend's child support and seeking a father figure could be seen as blaming the victim, even if that's not the intention. It might invalidate the friend's feelings and further the conflict rather than resolve it.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions highlight that the author might have come across as privileged, even if they feel they aren't. The way the author mentions their own job in the adult industry and their MBA could be perceived as one-upmanship, especially if not done with care. The friend's situation is complex, and the author's response might not have considered the nuances, like the friend's possible struggles or the fact that none of the fathers pay child support, which is a systemic issue rather than her fault.\n\nThere's a better way to address hurtful comments without being confrontational. The author could have expressed their feelings about the insults and perhaps suggested support or resources, but directly pointing out the friend's child support issues in a judgmental tone probably wasn't the right approach. The key here is whether the author's response was constructive or just an attack back. Since it led to the friend's fury and damaged the friendship, it's likely the author did cross a line, even if they were tired of the insults.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. They could have handled it more sensitively. But I need to check again: the friend was being insulting, and the author was trying to be honest. However, honesty doesn't excuse being hurtful. The mutual friends' reactions also suggest that the author's reply was not appropriate. So yeah, AITA here is the author.\n"
