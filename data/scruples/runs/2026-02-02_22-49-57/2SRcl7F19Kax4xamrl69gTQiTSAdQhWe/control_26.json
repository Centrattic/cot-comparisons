It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault for telling their friend the truth about her situation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has five kids with different fathers and is single. She's been divorced five times. She's been making comments that the author feels are insulting\u2014like questioning the author's weight and dating life. The author kept brushing these off but finally told the friend that her situation with the kids might be why she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend got upset, hung up, and now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author tried to address the friend's behavior after being insulted repeatedly. The author's response was direct but based on their observations. The friend's reaction was emotional, and others are criticizing the author for being privileged and not understanding.\n\nI need to consider if the author crossed a line. The comments the friend made were personal and possibly hurtful. The author's response was factual, pointing out a possible cause for the friend's situation. But even if true, how it's delivered matters. The author might have been justified in wanting to stop the insults, but maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the friend's own actions (insulting the author) might have justified a response. The author's statement was based on their own experience (having kids with the same dad and working towards education). The mutual friends' reactions are interesting\u2014they think the author is privileged, but the author argues they've worked hard. Maybe the author isn't being entitled, but the way they spoke might have come off as judgmental.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, even if the truth is spoken, the delivery can affect how it's received. The friend might have felt attacked, even if the author's statement was a valid observation. So, while the author had a reason to respond, the method might not have been the best. But since the question is if the author is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the truth was delivered in a constructive way. The author's statement, while honest, might have been harsh. However, they were responding to years of insults. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they were standing up for themselves, but some might argue that they should have addressed it differently. Considering the options A or B, I think the answer leans towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they were responding to a friend's hurtful comments and stating their honest opinion, even if it wasn't received well. The friend's own behavior contributed to the conflict.\n"
