It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because of having five kids with different fathers and not getting child support. The friend had been making insults for two years about the author's weight, job, and dating life.\n\nFirst, the author's friend was making a lot of hurtful comments. The author tried to brush them off with advice like focusing on oneself. Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer about her situation with the kids and child support. The friend responded angrily and hung up. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and a bad friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's response was justified. The friend was being insulting for a long time, but the author's reply brought up a sensitive topic\u2014commenting on her friend's personal life and children. Even if the author's statement is true, calling out someone's personal situation in the heat of the moment might come off as harsh or judgmental, especially if the friend wasn't open to that kind of feedback.\n\nAlso, the author's friend might already be feeling vulnerable or defensive about her dating issues and child support problems. The author's response could have been perceived as blaming her for her current state, which can be really hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, it's possible that the delivery was too direct without considering the friend's feelings. Friends might feel that the author crossed a line by bringing up the children, which is a sensitive and personal matter, especially when the friend's own insecurities are involved.\n\nMoreover, the mutual friends are pointing out that the author might have \"skinny privilege,\" which suggests that the author's own experiences are seen as different from the friend's. The author's job in the adult industry, though maybe not known to others, might be a point of sensitivity. But the key here is the nature of the response. While the friend's behavior was inappropriate and the author had been patient, the directness of the reply could have been too much, especially if the friend wasn't seeking advice but just venting or trying to mock.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for standing up for themselves, but the way they delivered the response could have been more empathetic. Maybe a better approach would have been to set boundaries and not engage in the insults, rather than confront the friend with a blunt truth. However, the friend's persistent insults over two years probably contributed to the build-up, so the author's frustration is understandable. The answer depends on weighing the friend's hurtful comments against the author's direct response. Since the situation is complex, but the author's reply was a truth they felt necessary to state after enduring years of insults, I think the answer is B (No), but with the consideration that the delivery could have been better. However, the user wants a choice between A and B. Given that the friend was being insulting and the author was responding to a question they asked, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's a better way. However, given the context, the answer is B.\n"
