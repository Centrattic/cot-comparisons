It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are affecting her dating life. The friend was making personal insults about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author finally responded with a truth they believed, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior was clearly toxic. She was making passive-aggressive comments, attacking the author's appearance and career, and even implying that the author's success was due to superficial reasons. That's pretty harsh. The author tried to brush it off for two years, which shows some patience, but eventually, they had to set a boundary.\n\nThe author's response points out the friend's situation as a factor in her dating struggles. While it's true that having multiple children with different fathers can complicate dating, the way it's framed might come off as judgmental. However, the friend was already in a cycle of relationships that didn't work out, so the author's comment might be a valid observation.\n\nThe friends' reactions about the author having \"skinny privilege\" or being entitled seem a bit off track. The author mentioned they're not skinny but work out, and they have a legitimate career (MBA and multiple jobs). The friend's issues might stem from her own insecurities rather than the author's privilege.\n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The author's intention was to address the root of the friend's dating issues, which they believed was the children's situation. However, the method might have been too direct and hurtful. A better approach could have been to express concern without blaming, maybe framing it as a challenge rather than a direct criticism.\n\nBut given the friend's history of insults, the author had a right to defend themselves. The friend's behavior was the catalyst for the argument, and the author was defending their own situation. While the response could have been more tactful, the underlying issue was the friend's toxic behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have handled it differently, they weren't entirely wrong for pointing out a truth they believed in, especially after enduring repeated insults. The friend's actions likely contributed to the conflict. So the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
