It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the friend has been making these insults for two years, and the author finally snaps and tells her she's single because of having five kids with different fathers. The friend then gets angry and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged and is a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making personal and potentially hurtful comments for a long time. The author has been brushing them off, but maybe they reached a breaking point. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in dating. The friend's response was a \"insult fury\" and hanging up.\n\nThe author mentions that their work in the adult industry is being criticized by the friend, even though the friend tried it too. The author also works another job and has an MBA. The friend's comments seem to be a mix of personal attacks and maybe jealousy.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The key factors here are the content of the response and the context of prior interactions. The author's friend had been making repeated, insulting remarks. The author's response, while pointing out a factual aspect (five kids with different dads), might be seen as a harsh truth. However, the way it's delivered could be hurtful. But considering the friend's history of insults, the author might be defending themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, mutual friends think the author is privileged and didn't understand the friend's situation. The author argues they worked hard and aren't entitled. The question is whether the response was justified given the context. The author was defending themselves against ongoing insults, so maybe it's not wrong. But maybe there's a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries without being confrontational.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response was a reasonable defense against the friend's insults or if it crossed a line. Since the friend had been making personal attacks for two years, the author's response might be seen as a justified pushback, even if it was blunt. However, some might argue that pointing out someone's situation in a negative way isn't helpful. But given the context of ongoing insults, the author might not be in the wrong. So, possibly answer B (No).\n"
