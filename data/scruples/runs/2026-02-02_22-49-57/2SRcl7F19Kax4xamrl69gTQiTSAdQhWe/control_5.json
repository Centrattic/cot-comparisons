It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that their friend has gone through five marriages, each resulting in a child with a different father, and now the friend is asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author finally snaps and tells their friend that having five kids with different dads without child support makes it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets angry, and mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, saying the author was rude and had \"skinny privilege.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've been brushing off the insults for two years, which is a long time. The friend's comments seem to be not only critical but also personal, targeting the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author felt that the friend's behavior was low-quality and untrue, so they finally responded with the truth about the friend's situation.\n\nThe key question here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend has a history of multiple marriages and children, which could be a sensitive topic. The author's statement points out a specific issue that could indeed affect the friend's dating life. However, the way it was delivered might have been hurtful. Even if the statement is factually true, it could come off as judgmental or lacking empathy.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are reacting by accusing the author of entitlement and privilege. The author's line of work in the adult industry might add another layer, as it's a controversial field, and their friends might perceive them as having advantages they don't. The author's response might have been seen as condescending, especially if the friend's situation is more complex than it appears on the surface.\n\nAnother angle is whether there was a better way to respond. The author could have addressed the friend's issues without directly pointing out the children and child support. Maybe offering support or understanding instead of a blunt truth. However, the friend had been making the author uncomfortable for two years, so the author might have felt cornered.\n\nIt's also important to consider intent. The author's intention was to stop the insults and provide an honest answer. But the impact was that it caused a fallout. The question is whether the method used was appropriate despite the intent.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have been trying to be truthful and set a boundary, the way they expressed it could have been more compassionate. The situation is complex, but the author's response might have crossed a line, making them partially in the wrong. However, the friend's behavior over two years also contributed to the tension. It's a tricky balance between honesty and empathy.\n"
