It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers is why she's having trouble finding a partner.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making hurtful comments about the author's size, job, and dating life for two years. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses, but eventually, when the friend asked a direct question, the author gave a honest answer pointing out the friend's situation as the issue. The friend then became angry, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"privilege\" and being a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's behavior has been consistently insulting, the author tried to avoid conflict but eventually set a boundary by telling the truth, and now others are side-eyeing the author. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, while the friend was disrespectful, the author's response was a direct and personal critique about the friend's life choices. Saying that having five kids with different fathers makes it hard to find someone is a judgment call, even if it's based on truth. Even if the friend's actions are contributing to her problems, the way the author delivered this could be seen as insensitive or cutting, especially in a personal conversation. \n\nAlso, the author is working in the adult industry, which might be a sensitive topic, and their friend also tried that job. So, mutual friends might perceive the author as having a better life or more privilege, even if that's not the case. The author's frustration is valid, but the timing and method of addressing the issues might not have been the best approach. \n\nIn situations like this, it's often about how you communicate truth. The author's response was blunt and potentially hurtful, even if the underlying message had some truth. Friends might feel that pointing out such a sensitive issue, especially after years of back-and-forth insults, was a breach of friendship boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), because while the friend was insulting, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line in a personal and potentially damaging way. However, there's nuance here. The friend's behavior was also problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the mutual friends' reactions and the nature of the response, the author might be seen as at fault for not handling it more compassionately or choosing a better time to address it. So, Answer A.\n"
