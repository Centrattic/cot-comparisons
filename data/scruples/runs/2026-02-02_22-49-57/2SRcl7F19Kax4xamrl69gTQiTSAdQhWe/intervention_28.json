It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for telling their friend that her status as a single mother with five kids by different fathers is why she's struggling to find a partner. The friend had been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author finally snapped with a truthful but blunt response. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and are being insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and insulting, targeting the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author had been trying to be supportive, but after two years of this, they responded with the truth about the friend's situation. The key here is that the author's response was a direct answer to the friend's question, not an unprovoked attack.\n\nNext, the friend's behavior over two years was persistent and hurtful. The author had been brushing off the insults, which shows they tried to handle it patiently. When the friend continued to ask the same question repeatedly, the author's answer was based on reality\u2014having five children with different fathers can indeed be a barrier to forming a stable relationship, as potential partners might feel they're being asked to take on a role as a de facto father figure without commitment or support.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions are also important. They accuse the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, but the author works hard, has an MBA, and a non-traditional job. The friend's issues with the author's job are hypocritical since she tried it too. The author's response was factual and not malicious, just stating a challenge the friend faces.\n\nHowever, the way the author delivered the truth might have been harsh. The friend was already sensitive about her situation, so even if the statement was true, it could have been phrased more compassionately. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for saying the truth after being insulted for so long. The author was defending themselves against ongoing attacks, which might justify their response.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that bringing up the friend's personal struggles in a conversation about dating isn't helpful. But given the history of insults, the author's response was a direct answer to a question, not an accusation. The friend's reaction (insult fury and hanging up) suggests she was more hurt by the truth than the author was in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the delivery could have been softer, the author's response was honest and a reaction to persistent provocation. The author isn't in the wrong for stating the truth after being subjected to two years of hurtful comments.\n"
