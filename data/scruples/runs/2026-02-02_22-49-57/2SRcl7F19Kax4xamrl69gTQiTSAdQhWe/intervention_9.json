It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by telling their friend that her situation with five kids from different fathers is why she's single. The friend was being insulting for two years, and the author finally replied honestly. \n\nFirst, the friend's comments were personal and hurtful, making the author feel targeted. The author tried to brush them off initially, but after repeated insults, they gave a direct answer. The key here is the context of the prior insults and the author's motivations.\n\nThe author's response points out a factual aspect of the friend's situation, not a personal attack. The friend's question was about why the author is successful in relationships while she isn't. The author's answer addresses a real-life obstacle the friend has created, not a judgment on her worth as a person. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's response was too direct and could be seen as insensitive. But considering the two-year history of insults, the author's response was a truthful reaction to the situation. The mutual friends' reactions seem to be projecting their own biases, like the \"skinny privilege\" comment, which doesn't align with the author's reality.\n\nThe author also mentions their own challenges, like working in a stigmatized industry and having an MBA. They worked hard, and their response was a factual observation. So, while the method might not have been the most tactful, the content wasn't malicious. The friend's behavior was the main issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
