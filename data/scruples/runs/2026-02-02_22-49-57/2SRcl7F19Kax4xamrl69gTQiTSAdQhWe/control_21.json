It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years before the author finally replied with their honest opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a pattern of making personal and insulting remarks about the author's dating life, comparing her to the author. The author tried to brush off the comments, giving advice like focusing on oneself. But after repeated insults, the author responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her being single. The friend then got angry and hung up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author works hard, has two kids with the same father, and works in the adult industry but also has an MBA and a regular job.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's response was justified given the context. The friend had been making repeated, hurtful comments, and the author was defending their own situation. The author's response might be seen as honest but perhaps harsh. However, the friend's behavior was also problematic with the constant insults. The mutual friends are siding with the friend, which could indicate that the author's response crossed a line. However, the author's frustration with being insulted repeatedly might also be a factor.\n\nI need to decide if the author's truthful response was a reasonable reaction to ongoing insults or if it was an overstep. In relationships, honesty is important, but the way it's delivered matters. The author might have been justified in wanting to set boundaries after two years of insults, but the choice of words might have been too direct or hurtful. The friend's situation is complex, and while the author's statement is true, it's possible that it came across as judgmental or insensitive, especially if the author didn't consider the friend's feelings or the context of her own struggles.\n\nAdditionally, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was perceived as coming from a place of privilege, which might not align with the author's self-perception. However, the author's own experiences of working hard and facing challenges (like being in the adult industry) might mean that they have faced their own difficulties. The question is whether the author's response was an appropriate defense against ongoing insults or if it was unkind regardless.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's behavior was clearly problematic, the author's response might have been a valid reaction to being insulted repeatedly. However, the harshness of the truth-telling might have been too much, and there could have been a more tactful way to respond. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a justified defense or if they overstepped despite the provocation.\n"
