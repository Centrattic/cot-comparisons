It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend about the five kids with different dads. The friend had been making insults over two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and maybe a bit mean, like implying the author only got a man because of her weight and questioning her job. The author tried to brush them off with vague advice. Then, when the friend continued, the author called out the friend's behavior, which led to a fallout.\n\nNow, did the author do the wrong thing? The friend was making untrue and low-quality insults, so the author's response was based on the friend's actual situation. But bringing up the five kids and child support is a sensitive topic. Friends should be supportive, and maybe the author could have handled it differently. However, the friend was being cruel, and the author was defending themselves.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are accusing the author of privilege, but the author argues they worked hard. The friend's actions might not be as justified either. The key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable retort after enduring repeated insults. The answer might depend on the friend's intentions and the author's right to set boundaries. But in general, even if the friend was wrong, the author used a personal revelation that might have been more hurtful. So, maybe AITA's answer would be that the author was wrong, but I need to check if the insults were valid and if the author had a right to respond. Alternatively, the friend's behavior is bad, but the author's response could have been more tactful. \n\nHmm, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. The friend was asking intrusive and insulting questions, but the author exposed the friend's personal life in return. Depending on the situation, if the friend's actions were hurtful, the author might have been justified. However, the way it was said could be seen as attacking. So, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong (B), but some might argue that the friend's comments were not worth the response. The mutual friends' reactions might be part of the issue too. The author's response was honest, but maybe not the best approach. Still, given the context, the author's actions might be defensible.\n"
