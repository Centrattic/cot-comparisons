It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's struggling to find a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making hurtful comments towards the author for two years, and the author finally snaps by pointing out the friend's situation. The friend then reacts negatively and the mutual friends side with the friend, accusing the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The friend had been persistently insulting the author for two years.\n2. The author's response was based on an observation they believed to be the root of the problem.\n3. The author's own situation is different\u2014they have kids with one father and a stable arrangement.\n4. The mutual friends are taking the friend's side without considering the context.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to be honest, but the way they delivered it might have been harsh. Even if the friend's situation is a factor, pointing it out in a direct and possibly judgmental way could be seen as hurtful. However, the friend had been making the author feel attacked for a long time, so the author might have felt justified in setting boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's response was a valid critique versus an insult. The author is pointing out a factual situation (five kids by different fathers) as a possible reason, which could be a legitimate concern to someone looking for a partner. But the tone and timing matter. The friend was already in a vulnerable state, repeatedly asking for advice and making insults, so the author's response might have been the catalyst she needed to address the issue, even if it came off as harsh.\n\nThe mutual friends' reaction is also worth considering. They might not fully understand the two-year history of insults, leading them to side with the friend. The author feels wronged because they were defending themselves after prolonged negativity.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, the author could have addressed the friend's behavior earlier or set clearer boundaries without making a direct accusation. But given the ongoing situation, the author's response might have been a culmination of frustration.\n\nSo, balancing the friend's behavior over time against the author's honest response, it's a tricky call. The author might not be entirely at fault since they were responding to years of negativity. However, the way they delivered the truth could have been more compassionate. The answer hinges on whether the author's response was an appropriate defense against the friend's attacks or an overstep. Given the context, the author's actions might be seen as a justified reaction to being targeted, making them not in the wrong. But some might argue that honesty needs to be delivered with care. However, considering the friend's history, the author's response, while blunt, was a truthful observation that the friend may have needed to hear.\n"
