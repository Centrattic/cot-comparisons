It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's single. The friend made a lot of insulting comments over two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and hurtful, targeting the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off, but after two years, they responded by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason she's struggling to find someone. The friend got upset and hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to speak the truth. The author feels they were just being honest and that they have worked hard for their success. They also mention their own challenges, like working in the adult industry and having kids. The friend's behavior included insults that were low quality and untrue, which the author was tired of enduring.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to feel defensive and frustrated. The friend's comments were not just occasional but over two years, which is a long time to endure. The author's response was direct and addressed the root issue they believed was causing the friend's problems. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, especially if the friend was already emotionally vulnerable. The friend's situation is complex, having five children with different fathers, which can be a significant challenge, and the author's comment about child support and needing someone to accept that could have been a valid point, but perhaps not the best way to approach it.\n\nOn the other hand, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, suggesting that the author didn't consider the friend's feelings. The author might have thought they were being honest, but maybe the approach was too direct and hurtful. The friend might not have wanted to hear that her personal decisions are the root cause of her single status, even if it's true. People often don't want to hear the truth when they're feeling vulnerable, and the author's comment could have come across as judgmental or condescending.\n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. They were tired of being insulted and wanted to defend themselves. However, responding with a critique of the friend's life choices might have been seen as crossing a line. The author's response could be perceived as attacking the friend's character rather than addressing the insults directly. The friend's repeated questioning and insults were problematic, but the author's response might not have been the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, both parties might have contributed to the conflict. The friend's behavior was hurtful and persistent, which is inexcusable, but the author's response might have been too harsh. The key is whether the author had a right to say that. While the statement itself is factual, the delivery and the timing could have been problematic. The author might have been trying to help the friend see the truth, but sometimes people aren't ready to hear that, especially from someone they consider a friend.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intentions were to be truthful and possibly to help the friend, but the method used caused further harm. The friend's situation is complex and challenging, and the author's comment might have come off as a personal attack rather than constructive feedback. Therefore, while the author had valid reasons for being upset, the way they responded might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's a better way to phrase it.\n"
