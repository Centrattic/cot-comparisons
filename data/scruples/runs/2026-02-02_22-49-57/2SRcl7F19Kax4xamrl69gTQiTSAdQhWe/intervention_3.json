It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers and no child support. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally snapped. The friend then got angry and ended the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior over two years has been a series of insults and personal attacks. The author mentions that they've been brushing off these insults with polite responses, but the friend persisted. The final comment from the author points out a specific issue\u2014the friend's situation with multiple children and lack of support. \n\nThe author's response is direct and honest, but it's also a personal truth they've observed. The friend's reaction was to get upset and hang up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author works hard and has challenges of their own.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's prior behavior, the author's response as a truthful observation, and the mutual friends' judgment. The question is whether the author crossed a line.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves after years of insults. They pointed out a valid point that the friend's situation might make it harder to find someone. On the other hand, the author's comment could be seen as a personal attack, even if it's true. Insults, even if based on truth, can be hurtful and might not be the best way to handle the situation.\n\nBut the friend had been the one starting conflicts with their own insults. The author was responding to a pattern of behavior. The author's comment was in response to the friend's repeated questions and attacks. The author might have felt justified in pointing out the obvious, especially if they believe their friend's actions are contributing to her problems.\n\nHowever, the way the author expressed it might have been harsh. Instead of focusing on the friend's situation, a better approach might have been to express concern without attacking. But given the friend's history of insults, the author might have been at their breaking point.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that they think the author overstepped, maybe because the comment about the children was too personal. Even if true, bringing up sensitive topics like child support and multiple fathers can be seen as crossing a boundary, especially in a friendship where such topics might be delicate.\n\nBut considering the context of ongoing insults, the author's response was a direct answer to the friend's question. The friend asked why the author has had success while she hasn't, and the author provided their perspective based on the situation. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest, especially when the friend had been attacking them first.\n\nIn conclusion, the author was responding to two years of insults and providing a truthful, albeit blunt, answer. While the delivery could be improved, the content of the message is a valid observation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
