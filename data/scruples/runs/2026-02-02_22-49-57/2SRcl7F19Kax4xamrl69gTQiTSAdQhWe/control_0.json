It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author has a friend who's been divorced five times, each with different fathers for her kids, and the friend hasn't been paying child support. The friend has been making comments that the author feels are insulting, like implying that the author's success in relationships is due to being skinny or being a \"basic blonde,\" even though the author clarifies they're not skinny and have two kids with the same dad.\n\nThe author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation\u2014five kids with different dads and no child support\u2014as a reason why others might be hesitant to date her. The friend gets angry, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend. The author is upset because they feel they're not privileged and have worked hard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend was making personal, potentially hurtful comments. The author tried to brush them off for two years, which shows they tried to handle it politely. When the friend kept pushing, the author finally responded with what they believed to be the truth about the friend's situation. \n\nBut is it the author's place to make that comment? The friend's behavior could be seen as toxic or bullying, with the insults. The author's response was honest but might have been direct or harsh. The key is whether the author's response was a justified defense of themselves or an overstep.\n\nIn terms of friendship, it's important to communicate in a way that's respectful. Even if the friend was insulting, the author might have been better off setting a boundary without reciprocating with their own judgment. However, the friend's comments were clearly undermining the author, and the author felt they had to defend themselves. \n\nThe mutual friends are saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The author's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, but they're also working hard. The friend's issues with child support and multiple partners could be seen as complicating her dating life, which the author pointed out. \n\nIs it fair for the author to mention the child support issue? That's a personal and sensitive topic. Even if true, bringing it up in a confrontation might be crossing a line. The author's intention was to explain why others might not want to date the friend, but doing so could come across as judgmental or using someone else's problems to deflect from their own insults.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending themselves against persistent negativity. They tried to ignore it but eventually felt cornered. The response was direct, which might not be the best approach, but maybe it was a moment of frustration. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend's behavior was clearly problematic, but the author's response might not have been the best way to handle it. The author could have said something like, \"I don't think I can discuss this further without being disrespectful to you,\" which sets a boundary without being confrontational. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions might be influenced by their own biases, but the author's comment could be seen as attacking the friend's personal situation, which can be hurtful even if it's true. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be partially in the wrong for responding in a way that was direct and potentially hurtful, even if the friend was being a jerk. The better approach would have been to set a boundary without reciprocating with personal attacks. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if the friend's behavior justifies the response. Since the friend was being toxic, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, in terms of how to respond to insults, the author could have handled it better. The truth might be true, but the way it was delivered matters. So, maybe A is the right choice here.\n"
