It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers might be making it hard for her to find a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been divorced five times and has five kids with different fathers. She's been making comments that the author finds insulting. The author finally responds by pointing out her situation as the issue. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and are being a bad friend.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was right to make that comment. Let's break it down. The author's response was based on the friend's actual circumstances, which are publicly known (since she has five kids). But is it fair to say that to her face, especially after she's been making negative comments about the author?\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves against what they perceive as unfair insults. They felt it was honest to point out a possible reason for their friend's situation. On the other hand, even if the statement is true, delivering it in a way that could be seen as judgmental or hurtful might cross a line. The friend's actions (five marriages, kids) are her own choices, and commenting on them might come off as shaming, especially if it's not constructive.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the comment was perceived as insensitive, possibly because it's a personal and sensitive topic. The author's job in the adult industry might add another layer, but that's more of a background detail here.\n\nI should consider whether the author had the right to make such a direct comment. Even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered and the intent matter. The author was tired of being insulted and wanted to respond truthfully, but maybe there's a better way to address the issue without shaming the friend. For example, suggesting support or offering advice could be more constructive than pointing out the friend's flaws.\n\nSo, while the author might have been justified in feeling frustrated and responding, the method of response could be seen as harsh. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more tactfully, even if the content was truthful.\n"
