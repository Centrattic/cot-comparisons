It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because of having five kids with different fathers. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author for two years, and the author finally snapped with a truthful response, which led to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend has been making personal attacks, focusing on the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush off the insults but eventually responded by pointing out the friend's situation. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, which the author denies.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior included repeated insults, which the author tried to ignore. However, when the author finally spoke the truth, the friend reacted negatively. The author's comment was about a factual situation (five kids with different fathers) which could be a legitimate factor in the friend's dating struggles, though it's a sensitive topic.\n\nBut in social interactions, even if something is true, how you say it matters. The author's response might have been blunt and could be perceived as judgmental. Friends often expect support rather than criticism, especially when the friend is in a vulnerable state. The author's honesty, while truthful, might have crossed a line into being hurtful, especially since they had a history of the friend making attacks.\n\nHowever, the author was also defending themselves after two years of being insulted. The friend's behavior was unkind, and the author's response was in response to a direct question. The mutual friends' reactions might be influenced by their own perspectives, but the core issue is whether the author's response was inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author wasn't entirely wrong because the friend was being cruel. However, the way the author delivered the truth could have been more tactful. The author might have been justified in defending themselves after enduring insults, but the manner of the response could have been more compassionate. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they handled the situation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's response, while truthful, was a direct criticism of the friend's personal life and might have been unkindly delivered, the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But there's a nuance because the author was responding to ongoing insults. It's a tricky balance between defending oneself and being hurtful.\n\nBut in social dynamics, even if someone has been insulted, responding with a direct and potentially judgmental comment might be seen as the wrong approach. The author could have found a more supportive way to address the issue without attacking the friend's personal choices. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their response, although true, was delivered in a way that was unkind and contributed to the conflict.\n"
