It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend has been making a lot of insults over two years, like implying the user's success in dating is due to being skinny or not having a real job. The user finally snapped and told her the truth, which made the friend angry and hung up. Now, mutual friends are saying the user has \"skinny privilege\" and is being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's friend has a history of making personal and untrue insults. The user tried to brush them off and give supportive answers before. The friend's own situation is problematic\u2014five kids with different dads and no child support, which might make it hard for others to be interested. The user's response was pointing out that fact, which the friend found offensive.\n\nBut the mutual friends are criticizing the user. Maybe they think the user was rude or that the comment was hurtful. The user is in the adult industry, which might be a sensitive topic, and the friend also tried that. The user feels they were defending themselves after enduring two years of insults.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the user cross a line by being honest? Is the friend's reaction justified? Are the mutual friends right in calling the user out for \"skinny privilege\"?\n\nThe user's response was direct and possibly harsh, even if true. Insulting the friend's personal choices might not have been the best approach. The user's own job in the adult industry is a valid point, but the friend's comments were about the user's dating success and weight, which the user felt were untrue. \n\nThe user might have been defending themselves by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason for her own struggles. However, even if the friend's situation is a factor, calling it out in a confrontational way could be seen as judgmental. Friends might not appreciate being compared or having their personal issues highlighted, especially if it's a sensitive topic like child support.\n\nMutual friends' reactions suggest that the user's comment was hurtful or inappropriate. The user claims they worked hard, but their statement might come off as condescending. Even if the user's intentions were to be truthful, the method of delivery in the middle of a conflict might not be effective.\n\nAlternative responses could include expressing empathy, acknowledging the friend's struggles without blaming, or setting boundaries without attacking. But the user chose to directly address the friend's situation, which might have been too harsh.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the user is in the wrong) because they responded with judgment instead of handling the insults more constructively. Even if the friend's situation is a factor, the way the user communicated it may have been unkind and not helpful, leading to the friend's negative reaction.\n"
