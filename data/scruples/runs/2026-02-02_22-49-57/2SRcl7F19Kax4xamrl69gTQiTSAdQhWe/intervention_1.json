It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend about having five kids by different fathers is in the wrong. The friend was insincere and kept making backhanded comments about the user's dating life, work, and appearance. The user finally responded with a direct answer, which the friend took as an insult and ended the conversation.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior seems problematic. She's been making snide remarks and insinuating negative things about the user's choices. The user tried to be kind and supportive, offering advice like \"focus on yourself\" and deflecting the insults. But after repeated provocation, the user called out the friend's situation, which led to a fallout.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are criticizing the user, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are entitled. The user feels this is unfair because they work hard and have a legitimate job in the adult industry, which they managed alongside their MBA and custody arrangement. The friend's complaints are about being unable to find dates, but her own actions (multiple pregnancies, no child support) might be the real issue.\n\nThe key here is whether the user's response was an appropriate way to handle the friend's behavior. The user's statement was a factual observation about the friend's situation, not an outright insult. However, it's possible that the way it was delivered came across as harsh or unsupportive. The friend was already defensive and the user might have been trying to be honest, but timing and delivery matter in friendships. Maybe a more compassionate approach could have helped without being as direct.\n\nBut considering the friend's history of making false and hurtful comments, the user had a right to set boundaries. The user's own life situation is stable, and the friend's issues with dating might be self-inflicted. The mutual friends' reactions might be a knee-jerk response, possibly influenced by guilt or not wanting to take sides. The user isn't in the wrong for pointing out a truth that others might not want to hear, especially if the friend was being insincere. The user's response was honest, even if it wasn't sugarcoated. So I think the answer is B.\n"
