It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has gone through five divorces and has five kids with different fathers. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author about her dating life and her job. The author has been trying to brush off these insults for two years but finally snapped and told her friend that her situation with the kids and lack of child support might be why she's having trouble finding someone. This led to a fallout where mutual friends are now saying the author is in the wrong, mentioning things like \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend was making personal, hurtful comments repeatedly over two years. The author tried to respond with advice that was positive, like focusing on oneself. But when the friend kept pushing, the author gave a direct answer that was honest but perhaps harsh. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and insulting. However, the author's response also points out a sensitive issue about the friend's personal life. Even if true, bringing up someone's past in a conflict might not be the best approach. The author might have felt wronged and wanted to set boundaries, but did it in a way that could be seen as attacking her friend's character.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions are important. They feel the author is privileged and entitled, which might be a valid point if the author's comments came off as judgmental. The friend's situation with multiple divorces and child support issues is a heavy topic, and commenting on it in the heat of an argument might not be helpful, even if factual.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's own behavior. She was the one starting the insults, which is inconsiderate and hurtful. The author had a right to feel upset, but responding with a direct critique of her friend's life choices could be seen as adding fuel to the fire. The author might have been within their rights to defend themselves, but the manner in which they did so might have crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of better responses, maybe the author could have set boundaries without attacking the friend's personal circumstances. For example, stating that they wouldn't engage in such insults or redirecting the conversation. However, given the ongoing nature of the insults, the author might have felt that a direct answer was necessary.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend's behavior was definitely wrong, but the author's response could be seen as equally harsh. The author might not be in the wrong for defending themselves, but the way they did it might have been inappropriate, leading to the fallout. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was perceived as judgmental, which could mean they are at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the friend was being rude, the author's response might have been too direct and contributed to the conflict. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the friend's insults justified a strong response. But since the question is from the author's perspective, considering the social context and the friends' reactions, the answer leaning towards A makes sense."
