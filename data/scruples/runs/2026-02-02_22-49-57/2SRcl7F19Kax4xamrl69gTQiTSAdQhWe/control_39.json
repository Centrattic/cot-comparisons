It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is divorced from all of them, and she's been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author for two years. The friend's questions are not just curious but also carry a tone of mockery and personal attacks.\n\nThe author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with five kids and no child support might be why she's struggling to find a partner. The friend then gets upset and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend. The author feels this is unfair and wants to know if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The friend has been persistently insulting the author for a long time. The author tried to deflect with advice like \"focus on yourself\" or \"you're in a small town,\" which might not have addressed the underlying issue. When the author finally responds truthfully, it's a direct statement about the friend's circumstances. The friend's reaction is anger, and the mutual friends side against the author, implying that the author shouldn't have criticized the friend's life choices, even if they were making the author's dating life harder.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, the friend was being hurtful and untrue in her insults. On the other hand, the author's response singles out a personal aspect of the friend's life (five kids with different fathers) which could be sensitive. But the author is also stating a fact that could be a valid concern for people considering a relationship with the friend. \n\nHowever, the way the author delivered the response might come across as judgmental. Even if the statement is true, pointing it out in a direct manner during a conversation where the friend is already being critical could escalate tensions. Friends who are upset might be emphasizing that the author should have handled it more delicately or not at all. \n\nThe author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, which could be a point of contention. The friend's comments about the author's job and work status might have been disrespectful. The author might feel justified in pointing out the friend's issues, but the context is important. The friend's situation could be due to various factors beyond her control, and the author's response might be seen as invalidating her experiences, even if the friend is not being a good friend. \n\nSo, the key points are: the friend was being insulting for a long time, the author's response was honest but direct, and mutual friends are now defending the friend, accusing the author of privilege. The author's intention was to stop the insults by pointing out the friend's own issues, but the method might not be the best.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main consideration is about the balance between honesty and respect. Even if the author is not wrong to be tired of the insults, responding with a potentially hurtful truth might not be the best approach. There's a difference between stating a fact and delivering it in a way that's compassionate. The friend's situation is complex, and the author's response could be seen as blaming her for her circumstances, which might not be fair if the friend is struggling. \n\nBut the friend's behavior over two years shows a pattern of disrespect. The author tried to ignore it but was pushed to a breaking point. The response was a direct answer to the friend's question, which was \"why can't I get anyone?\" The author's answer points out a possible reason. However, the friend might not want to hear that, and the author's tone could be contributing to the problem. \n\nMutual friends are now saying the author is a bad friend, which suggests that in their community, such comments are seen as crossing a line. The author might have a right to be honest, but the way they said it without considering the friend's feelings could make them at fault. Also, the author might have been trying to protect themselves from ongoing insults, which is understandable, but the method might not be the healthiest. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a reason to be frustrated and state the truth, the way they did it could be perceived as harsh, especially in a friendship where the friend had been consistently insulting. The author's response, though honest, might be seen as out of line without a more empathetic approach. The mutual friends' reactions indicate that the community values kindness over blunt honesty in such situations. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it.\n"
