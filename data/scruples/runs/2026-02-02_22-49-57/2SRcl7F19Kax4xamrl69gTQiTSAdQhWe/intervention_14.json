It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong after telling their friend that having five kids with different dads is why she's single. The friend had been making a lot of insults about her appearance and dating life, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the friend's situation. The mutual friends are now side-eyeing the author, saying things like they have privilege.\n\nHmm. The author's friend was clearly being rude and making personal attacks. The author tried to brush it off for two years, which shows they were trying to be polite. But when the friend kept pushing, the author felt justified in responding about the five kids issue. Now, the question is whether that response was appropriate.\n\nThe friend's comments about the author's job, weight, and dating life were pretty harsh and possibly untrue. The author's response was a direct but honest assessment of the friend's situation. While it might have been harsh, the key here is intent. The author was defending themselves after enduring two years of insults. But did they cross a line?\n\nThe mutual friends are saying the author had privilege, implying they didn't understand the friend's struggles. But the author mentions working hard and having different circumstances. The friend's behavior was toxic, and the author was trying to be honest. However, bringing up child support and the number of kids could be seen as personal and cutting. Maybe there was a better way to handle it without being so direct, but the friend was already being insulting. \n\nIn the end, the author had a right to set boundaries after being insulted. The response might not have been the best, but the situation was the friend's fault for being rude. So the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Considering the context, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
