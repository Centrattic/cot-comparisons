It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend who's been divorced five times and keeps making insulting comments about the author's dating life and job. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's five kids with different fathers, leading to a fallout.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the dynamics of the friendship and the nature of the insults. The friend has been making comments over two years that the author finds insulting and untrue. The author tried to brush them off but eventually snapped back with a direct statement about the friend's situation. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author has had their own challenges like working hard for their achievements and having a difficult divorce as well.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was justified. The friend's comments seem to be both personal and perhaps rooted in jealousy or frustration. The author's reply was honest but maybe not the most tactful way to address it. Saying that the friend has five kids with different dads and none of them pay support might be the truth, but it's delivered in a way that could be seen as shaming or judgmental. Even if the friend was being mean, the author's response could have exacerbated the situation instead of resolving it.\n\nThen, the mutual friends' reactions. They're saying the author has privilege and doesn't understand the friend's struggles. The author argues they've worked hard and aren't privileged. It's tricky because the friend's comment about the author's job and dating might have been hurtful, but responding with a personal attack might not be the right approach. \n\nIn terms of advice, sometimes even if someone is being mean, the best strategy is to avoid reciprocating with similar harshness. It can lead to more conflict. The author was trying to be honest but perhaps could have found a more supportive way to address the issue without attacking the friend's choices. Mutual friends might be taking sides, but if the author's comments were harsh, it's understandable why they might blame the author, even if the friend was being difficult. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they responded in a way that could be seen as judgmental and hurtful, even if the friend was being unkind. The better approach might have been to set boundaries without bringing up the friend's personal failings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
