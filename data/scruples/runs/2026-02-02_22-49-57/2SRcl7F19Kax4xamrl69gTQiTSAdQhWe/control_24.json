It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single. The friend had been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author finally responded with what they considered the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and insulting, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses but eventually snapped. The key here is whether the author's response was a justified reaction to ongoing insults or if it crossed a line.\n\nThe friend has five children with different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The author pointed out that this might make it hard for someone to accept her. The author's own situation is different: two kids with the same father, a stable custody arrangement, and a job that provides a good income. The author might feel that their friend's situation is contributing to her difficulties in dating.\n\nHowever, the friend's response was to launch into an insult fury and hang up. The mutual friends are now taking her side, saying the author has privilege and was entitled. The author is defensive, feeling they've worked hard and aren't privileged.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and persistent. The author was defending themselves after being insulted repeatedly. But when the author responded by pointing out the friend's situation, it might have come across as judgmental or blaming, even if it's the truth. \n\nIn social dynamics, even if something is true, how it's delivered matters. The author might have been justified in feeling frustrated, but the way they responded could have been seen as attacking their friend's personal choices. It's possible that the author's comment, while honest, wasn't the best way to address the situation and could have been perceived as cruel, even if it's a factual observation.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friend's issues are complex, and the author's comment might have oversimplified or judged her circumstances. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the comment was hurtful enough to damage the friendship and social standing. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's response, while perhaps a reaction to ongoing insults, might still be seen as crossing a line by making a judgmental statement about their friend's personal life. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
