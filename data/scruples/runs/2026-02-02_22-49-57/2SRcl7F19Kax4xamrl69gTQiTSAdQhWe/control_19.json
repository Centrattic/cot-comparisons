It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who has five kids with different fathers and is single. The author's friend has been making insults, and the author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation regarding the kids and child support. Now, the mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and are being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author's friend has been making repeated, hurtful comments directed at the author. The author has been brushing them off, but after a while, they respond honestly when asked a question. The friend reacts negatively, and then mutual friends side with the friend.\n\nThe key points are whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's statement was that having five kids with different fathers makes it hard to find someone. Is that a valid point or an insult? It seems like the author is pointing out a factual challenge, but it's framed in a way that might come off as judgmental. However, the friend's behavior of repeatedly insulting the author might have justified the author speaking up after enduring the negativity for two years.\n\nThe mutual friends are blaming the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. But the author mentions working hard, having an MBA, and a stable job in the adult industry. So, the mutual friends' judgment might be superficial. Also, the friend's insults were untrue or low-quality, as the author notes they don't have to starve to be skinny and work out. The friend's comments about the author's job might be hypocritical since the friend tried the same work.\n\nThe author's response was a direct answer to the friend's question, highlighting a real issue that could affect relationships. While it's possible that the author could have phrased it more sensitively, the core issue is whether pointing out the truth was wrong. Since the friend's behavior was the catalyst and the author was defending against untrue insults, the author might not be in the wrong. The friends' reactions could be based on misunderstanding the context of the insults and the author's situation.\n\nSo, considering the back-and-forth and the fact that the author was responding to persistent negativity, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
