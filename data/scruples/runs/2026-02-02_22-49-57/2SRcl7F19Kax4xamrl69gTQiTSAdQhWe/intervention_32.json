It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and no child support. The friend was being insulting, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been dealing with two years of insults from their friend, who's clearly in a bad place with her life. The friend's comments were personal and hurtful, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses, but eventually, they called out the friend's situation as a possible reason she's still single.\n\nNow, the author's response was direct and pointed out a factual issue: the friend's multiple children with different fathers and lack of child support. That might be a valid point in terms of why someone might hesitate to date her, but is it the author's place to say that? The friend was already being hostile, so the author might feel justified in defending themselves after being insulted for so long.\n\nHowever, the friends are saying the author used \"skinny privilege\" and is being entitled. Even if the author is not skinny, the friend might perceive the comment as linking the author's success in dating to physical attributes, which could be seen as insensitive. But the author's actual point was about the children and child support, not about their weight. The author also mentions they work out and have a healthy weight, so maybe the friend misinterpreted the comment.\n\nThe author's main point is about the practical issues of having five kids with different fathers. That's a real challenge in finding a partner, but bringing it up in a direct way might come off as harsh, even if true. The friend was already defensive and insulted the author multiple times, so the author might have felt cornered. The author's response was honest, but it's possible they could have phrased it more empathetically or used a different approach.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author was in the wrong. The friend was the one initiating the insults for two years, and the author finally responded with what they believed to be the truth. While the method might not have been the best, the content of the message was pointing out a legitimate factor. However, in social dynamics, even factual statements can be hurtful if delivered in the wrong context. The author might have crossed a line by addressing the friend's situation so bluntly, especially after being insulted multiple times. Friends often have boundaries, and the author might have overstepped by bringing up such a sensitive topic, even if it's true.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending themselves against constant insults. They didn't respond immediately but waited two years, which shows they tried to be patient. The friend's behavior was the initial problem, so the author's response, while direct, could be seen as a justified defense. The friends' reactions suggest they don't see the friend's behavior as harmful, which complicates things. The author's actions might be seen as a necessary boundary after repeated provocation.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's behavior was the root issue, and the author was finally standing up for themselves. However, the way they delivered the message could be seen as harsh, but the content itself was a truthful observation.\n"
