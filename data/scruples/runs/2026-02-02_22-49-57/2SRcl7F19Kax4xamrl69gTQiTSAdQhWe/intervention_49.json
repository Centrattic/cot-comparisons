It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has had five kids with different fathers, all divorced, and hasn't been paying child support. The friend has been making insincere and insulting comments to the author about her dating life and work. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a reason she's having trouble dating, which leads to the friend getting angry and cutting off contact. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying she's privileged and in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been insulting the author for two years, making comments about her weight, job, and dating life. The author has tried to brush it off, but the insults are persistent. When the friend asks a question, the author answers honestly, pointing out the friend's own issues as a barrier to dating. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: Was the author's response a justified defense against ongoing insults, or was it an unkind attack? The author's friend has been making personal and untrue comments, so the author's response was addressing the root of the problem. However, even if the friend's issues are valid, the way the author presented it might have come across as harsh, especially if the friend was already sensitive about it. \n\nAnother angle is the friend's history of making the author feel bad. The author might have felt that by pointing out the friend's situation, they were being honest and truthful. But maybe there was a better way to handle it without being confrontational. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was seen as attacking the friend's personal life, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they have their own challenges and have worked hard for their achievements. The friend's claim that the author is \"entitled\" might be a projection from the friend's own insecurities. However, mutual friends are siding with the friend, which could indicate that the author's approach backfired, even if the intention was to be honest.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, sometimes pointing out someone else's flaws, even if true, can be seen as unkind if not done with care. The friend was already in a place of feeling insecure and was lashing out. The author's response might have been the honest truth, but it could have been delivered more compassionately. However, the author had been enduring two years of insults, so their frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, responding to insults with a truthful but direct answer might be seen as justified self-defense. On the other, it could be seen as crossing a line by bringing up sensitive topics. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate and considerate of the friend's feelings. Since the friend was already being insulting, the author might have felt justified, but the outcome shows that the friend was hurt, leading to a breakdown in the friendship. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might have been to be honest and truthful, the method could have been more tactful. However, given the friend's prior behavior, it's debatable whether the author is in the wrong. The mutual friends' judgment might be biased, but their reaction suggests that the author's response was perceived as harsh. So, the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because even if the friend was being mean, the author's response might have been the final straw and could have been handled more sensitively.\n"
