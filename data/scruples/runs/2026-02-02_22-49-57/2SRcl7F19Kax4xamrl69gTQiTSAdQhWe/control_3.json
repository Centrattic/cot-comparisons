It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and none of them pay child support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments over two years, insulting the author's appearance, work, and dating life. The author finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in finding a partner. The friend took offense and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics of the friendship. The friend's behavior over two years has been persistent and insulting. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses, but eventually felt compelled to address the root cause they observed in the friend's life. The author's response was direct and honest, pointing out a factual situation (five kids with different fathers, no child support) that could be a barrier to forming a stable relationship. However, mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, suggesting the author was out of line.\n\nI need to consider whether the author's response was a reasonable reaction to ongoing insults or if it crossed a line. The author's intention was to address the underlying issue they believed was causing the friend's difficulties. However, friends are now saying the author is privileged and that they shouldn't have made that comment. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's important to assess if the response was a justified defense against constant attacks. The author might have felt that their friend's situation was being ignored, and they wanted to highlight a real-world challenge. However, delivering this critique in a direct manner during a conversation where the friend is already in a critical mood might have been unwise. \n\nFriendship dynamics also play a role here. Even if the author's statement was factually true, the manner and timing could be problematic. Friends might perceive it as judgmental or insensitive, especially if the friend is not open to receiving such feedback. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that they found the author's comment harsh or inappropriate, which complicates the matter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had been enduring a two-year period of insults and might have felt that their friend was projecting insecurities onto them. The author's response was a direct attempt to address the core issue they observed, which could be seen as honest communication rather than an attack. However, the effectiveness of that communication is in question because it led to a breakdown in the friendship.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's response was a reasonable defense against ongoing insults or if it was an overstep. The fact that the author was working on their own issues (two kids, split custody, a job in the adult industry) might provide context for their own perspective. However, mutual friends are criticizing the author for entitlement, which could indicate that the community's standards of what's acceptable to say are different.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have felt justified in pointing out the friend's situation, the way they delivered it could be seen as crossing a line, especially in a friendship where the friend was already being hostile. The mutual friends' reactions support the idea that the author's comment was perceived as hurtful despite their intent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the sensitivity of the topic and the existing tension between them.\n"
