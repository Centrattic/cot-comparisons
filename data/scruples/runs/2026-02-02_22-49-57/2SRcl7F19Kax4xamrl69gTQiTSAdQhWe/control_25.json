It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has gone through five divorces and has kids with different fathers. The friend has been making passive-aggressive comments about the author's dating life and job, and the author finally snapped by pointing out that the friend's situation with five kids and no child support might be a barrier to finding someone. The friend got angry, hung up, and mutual friends are now taking her side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been insulting the author for two years, which is a long time. The author tried to brush off the comments with polite responses. The friend's comments are not just about the author's dating life but also touch on sensitive topics like body image, job, and the adult industry. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a reason for her dating struggles. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's response was a fair and appropriate way to address the friend's behavior. On one hand, the author was being honest and perhaps pointing out a valid point. The friend's situation could indeed make it harder to find a partner, but is it the author's place to say that? Also, the friend's comments were personal and hurtful, so maybe the author was just defending themselves. \n\nHowever, the way the author delivered the message could be problematic. Telling someone they're in a bad situation because of their choices might come off as judgmental, even if it's true. The friend might feel attacked, especially since the author's response was direct and possibly harsh after years of passive comments. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's words were seen as hurtful and maybe even privileged, even if the author didn't mean to be.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's own behavior. She's been making untrue and insulting comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author might have felt cornered and finally broke, which could be understandable. But the question is about whether the author was wrong to respond in that way. \n\nThe answer might depend on the intent and the context. The author was tired of being insulted and tried to address the root cause, but maybe a better approach would have been to set boundaries without making a direct accusation. The author's comment could be seen as cutting and judgmental, even if it's true, which might explain why the mutual friends side with the friend. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong not because the statement was factually incorrect but because it was delivered in a way that was hurtful and escalated the conflict after a long period of passive-aggressive behavior. The better approach might have been to address the friend's comments without attacking her directly, perhaps by explaining that the comments were hurtful and setting boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong)."
