It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple kids with different fathers are affecting her dating life. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend has been making a lot of comments that are insulting and personal. She's been asking the author questions that come off as condescending, like linking the author's dating success to being skinny or not eating. The author has been trying to brush these off with advice like focusing on oneself.\n\nThen, when the friend keeps pushing and asking why she can't get dates, the author replies honestly about the kids with different dads and lack of child support. This leads the friend to get angry and hang up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author works hard and has a stable situation.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the author was justified in calling out the friend's situation. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and invasive. The author was defending their own choices and pointing out a realistic barrier the friend might have. But the friends are reacting poorly, suggesting that the author crossed a line.\n\nOn one hand, the author was responding to years of insults by stating a fact that could be a legitimate reason for the friend's difficulty in dating. On the other hand, bringing up someone's personal issues, even if true, in a direct way can be seen as harsh, especially if it's done in a way that's not sensitive. The friend's history with multiple partners and child support issues is a sensitive topic, and pointing it out might have been a low blow, even if it's true.\n\nThe author mentions they have two kids with the same dad, so they might have a different perspective. But the friend's behavior was clearly problematic, and the author was tired of being insulted. However, the response might have been too direct and hurtful, leading to the fallout. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries without bringing up the friend's personal issues. \n\nThe mutual friends' reaction suggests that they see the author as the one who overstepped. Even if the comments were true, the approach might have been wrong. The question is whether the truth justifies the way it was delivered. Sometimes, even if something is true, saying it in a confrontational way can damage a relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they responded with a personal truth that could be seen as an attack, even if the friend was being difficult. However, the friend's behavior was also toxic. But in terms of the author's action, it's possible they went too far, even if they were justified in feeling targeted. So, probably answer A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it the best way, even if their intention was to be honest.\n"
