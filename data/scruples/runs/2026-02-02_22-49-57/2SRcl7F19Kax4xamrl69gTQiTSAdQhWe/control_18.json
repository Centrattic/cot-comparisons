It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids from different fathers and is still single. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's dating life and work. The author finally tells her that having five kids with different dads without child support is making it hard for someone to commit. The friend got angry and hung up, and now mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the two friends. The author mentions that the friend has been making personal and sometimes untrue insults for two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses, but eventually, they snapped. The key here is whether the author's response was justified given the context of ongoing insults.\n\nThe friend's statement about the author's job seems like an insult, especially since the author is in the adult industry but also has an MBA and a regular job. The friend's comments are not just about the author's dating life but also about their work, which the author worked hard to achieve. So, there's a pattern of the friend belittling the author's efforts and choices.\n\nWhen the author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason for her difficulty in dating, it's a direct but honest answer. The author is trying to highlight a real-life challenge the friend is facing, which could be a valid point. However, the way it's communicated might come off as harsh, especially if the friend wasn't ready to hear it. But given the history of insults, the author might have felt justified.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are saying the author has privilege and is being entitled. The author argues they've worked hard for what they have. This touches on the concept of \"privilege\" and whether the author's response was insensitive. However, the author's own challenges\u2014like being in the adult industry and managing two kids with split custody\u2014might be more complex than the friends realize.\n\nThe question is whether the author crossed a line by pointing out the friend's situation. While honesty is important, it's also about timing and the context of the conversation. The author had been defending against insults for two years, so the response might be a form of self-defense. However, the manner of delivery could have been more empathetic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were responding to a long-standing issue of being insulted. However, there's room for a more constructive approach. The friend's behavior was problematic, and the author's response, while honest, might not have been the most supportive way to address it. \n\nBut considering the context, the author's response was a direct result of being targeted with insults over a long period. The friends' judgments about privilege might not fully understand the author's situation. So, the author's actions are more of a reaction to ongoing disrespect rather than an unprovoked attack. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
