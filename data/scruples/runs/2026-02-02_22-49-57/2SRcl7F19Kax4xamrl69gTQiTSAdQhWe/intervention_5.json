It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's struggling to find a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making repeated, hurtful comments about the author's appearance, dating life, and job. The author tried to brush these off for two years but finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in finding someone. \n\nThe friend then reacted angrily and hung up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, which the author disagrees with.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key point is whether the author's truthful response was an appropriate way to handle the ongoing insults. On one hand, the author was defending themselves and addressing the root issue the friend had been circling around. On the other hand, the friend's situation is complex and sensitive, and the author's comment might have been hurtful, even if true.\n\nBut the author had been the target of insults for a long time. They tried to deflect with polite responses, but when the friend kept pushing, the author's honest reply was a direct response to the underlying issue. The friend's behavior was already toxic, and the author might have felt cornered. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions seem to focus on the author's privilege, but the author argues they've worked hard. The friend's issues with child support and dating are real challenges. However, the author's response was a factual observation, not a malicious attack. \n\nIn such cases, while the author's method of responding could have been softer, the underlying issue the friend raised (why the author has dates while she doesn't) was addressed with a truthful answer. The friend's reaction might be more about defensiveness than the content of the response. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer leans towards B.\n"
