It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple kids with different fathers are affecting her chances of dating. The friend was making a bunch of insults, and the author finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation. Now mutual friends are calling the author out for being privileged and not understanding.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend had been making personal and hurtful comments for two years, and the author tried to brush them off but finally snapped. The author's response was about the friend's kids and child support, which the author believed was a valid reason for the friend's dating struggles. \n\nBut the question is whether that response was wrong. The friend's behavior was definitely problematic, making untrue and insulting remarks. However, the author's reply was also a personal attack, pointing out the friend's situation. Even if the statement is true, the way it was delivered might have been too harsh or not the best approach. \n\nThe mutual friends think the author is entitled, so maybe the author's tone or the content of the message came off as judgmental. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, the response might have been more about pointing out the friend's flaws rather than offering support. \n\nAlso, considering the friend's history of insults, the author was likely feeling defensive. But responding with a direct criticism, even if it's the \"truth,\" can be seen as crossing a line. It might be better to address the insults by setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal life. \n\nSo, while the friend definitely was in the wrong for the ongoing insults, the author's response might not have been the best way to handle it. The author could have expressed their feelings about the insults without making a personal attack. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for responding in a way that escalated the conflict, even if the friend was being an ass.\n\nHmm, but maybe the author was just being honest. However, in a friendship, even if someone is being insulting, the way you respond matters. The key is whether the author's response was a valid form of self-defense in the context of the relationship. If the friend was consistently attacking the author, the author might feel justified in pointing out the cause of the friend's issues. But in reality, making a personal critique about someone's life choices, even if true, can be hurtful and might not be helpful. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's statement was a proportionate response to the insults. The friend's comments were personal and untrue, so the author's response, while truthful, was also personal. It's possible that the author's response was a valid defense, but it's also possible that the mutual friends' reactions show that the author's response wasn't well-received and caused more harm. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely wrong for responding the way they did, given the context of ongoing insults. However, there might have been a better way to communicate the same point without attacking the friend's personal life, which could have been more productive. So, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong (answer B), but maybe could have handled it better. But since the question is a yes or no, the answer would be B (No).\n"
