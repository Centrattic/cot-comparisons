It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their friend that she's still single because she has five kids by different fathers. The friend has been making repeated, insulting comments about the author's appearance, job, and dating life for two years. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation, which leads to the friend hanging up and mutual friends criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comments are clearly hurtful and contain elements of bullying. The author has been trying to brush them off with advice like \"focus on yourself,\" but after two years, they feel compelled to respond directly. The author's statement about the friend's five children and child support is factual, so they aren't spreading rumors, which is a point in their favor.\n\nThe friend's actions are problematic. Making persistent, personal insults is on them. The author's response, while direct, addresses a real issue the friend has. The key here is whether the author's reply was a justified response to the ongoing insults or if it crossed a line. Mutual friends are blaming the author for \"privilege,\" but the author is in the adult industry, which isn't typically considered a privileged position. They also have an MBA and a stable income, but the friend is making baseless comparisons.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was an appropriate defense. In many cases, responding to insults with your own points can escalate conflicts, even if the points are true. The author's intent was to set boundaries after being insulted repeatedly. However, the way they framed the response might have been confrontational. Maybe a better approach would have been to redirect the conversation without attacking back, but in the heat of the moment, the author chose to address the root cause they believed was the issue.\n\nConsidering the friend's history of insults and the author's intent to stop the negative behavior, the author's reply might be seen as a reaction to defend themselves rather than an unprovoked attack. However, the method of communication is crucial. Even if the friend's actions are inexcusable, the author's response could be perceived as harsh. The friend's emotional state might contribute to the reaction, but the author is also justified in wanting to stop the bullying.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. They were defending against insults, but the approach may not be the most constructive. However, given the context, it's a response to ongoing negativity. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they were addressing a real issue that the friend's comments were attacking, but some might argue that the delivery was poor. However, the friend's behavior initiated the problem. I think the author is not at fault here, so the answer is B.\n"
