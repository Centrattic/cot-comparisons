It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of insults towards the author for two years, commenting on the author's weight, dating life, and job. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the five kids and no child support. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and were out of line.\n\nSo, the core question is whether calling out the friend's situation is justified. The author felt they were being insulted and tried to brush it off for two years. When they finally confronted the friend, they were honest about what they saw as the reason for her being single. \n\nI need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and insulting, which the author endured for a long time. The author's response was a direct statement of a fact about their friend's life that could impact her dating prospects. However, even if true, delivering it in a way that's blunt might have been harsh. \n\nThe mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and entitled, but the author feels they've worked hard and aren't privileged. The key here is whether the author had the right to point out the friend's situation in that context. \n\nAlso, the friend has a history of making low-quality insults, so the author might have felt justified in responding with something they believed to be true. However, the way it was delivered could have been an insult in itself, even if based on a truth. \n\nIn terms of friendship, honesty is important, but so is how that honesty is communicated. The author might not be wrong for telling the truth, but maybe the approach could have been more considerate. However, given the friend's prior behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the context of two years of insults and the author's attempt to finally address it honestly, I think the author's response, while perhaps not the kindest, might not be in the wrong. They were responding to a friend who had been consistently insulting them. So maybe the answer is B (not wrong). But I need to check if there's a better way to frame the response without being confrontational. \n\nHowever, mutual friends are criticizing the author, so maybe the author overstepped. The line between honesty and being hurtful can be thin. But since the friend's actions were harmful, the author's response might be seen as a form of self-defense. So leaning towards B.\n"
