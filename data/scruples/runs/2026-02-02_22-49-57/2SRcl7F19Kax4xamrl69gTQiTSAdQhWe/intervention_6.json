It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple kids with different fathers are affecting her ability to find partners. The situation involves a lot of back and forth between friends, with the author feeling insulted and finally responding with the truth they believe in.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author's friend has been making comments about their own situation, which the author brushes off for two years. The friend's comments are personal and seem to be insults, comparing the author's life to hers. The author then responds with the truth about the friend's situation, which leads to the friend being upset and others criticizing the author.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's response was justified. The friend made repeated comments, some of which were untrue (like saying the author is skinny, which they aren't, and questioning their job). The author's response points out the friend's history of multiple children with different fathers, which they think is a barrier to finding someone. \n\nNow, considering social norms and friendship dynamics, honesty is important, but so is empathy. The friend's history might be a sensitive topic. Even if the author believes it's the truth, bringing it up in a direct and potentially shaming way could be hurtful. Friends often have boundaries about what's okay to discuss. The author's frustration is valid given the two years of insults, but the way the response was delivered might have crossed a line. \n\nAdditionally, the mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting that the author's comment might have come off as judgmental or privileged. Even if the author's intention was to be truthful, the delivery might not have considered the friend's feelings or the deeper issues the friend might be facing. The author also mentions their own challenges, like working in the adult industry and having an MBA, which shows they have their own struggles, but that doesn't necessarily justify the response.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author was defending themselves and speaking honestly about a real issue. On the other hand, the friend's situation is complex, and the author's comment might have been too harsh without giving the friend the benefit of the doubt. The author could have approached the conversation with more sensitivity, perhaps acknowledging the friend's difficulties while still offering their perspective.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on whether the truth was communicated in a constructive way. The author might not be entirely wrong for speaking their mind, but the method could have been better. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the context of two years of insults and the author's own challenges, it's a tough call. But the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the approach was problematic, leaning towards the author being in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. Hmm.\n"
