It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been making a lot of comments that come off as insults. The friend has five kids with different fathers and has been divorced five times. She's been asking the author questions that are pretty demeaning, like implying that the author's success in dating is because she's skinny or a blonde.\n\nThe author tried to brush these off for two years by giving advice like focusing on oneself. Then, when the friend kept pushing, the author finally told her that having five kids with different dads might be making it hard to find someone. The friend got angry and hung up. Now the mutual friends are saying the author is being entitled and using skinny privilege, even though the author doesn't feel privileged.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's friend was being rude and making personal attacks. The author's response was honest and pointed out a fact that the friend's situation might be affecting her dating life. But the way it was said might have come across as harsh, even if it's true. The author's friend might have felt attacked, especially if the friend was already sensitive about her situation. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the friend tried to do the same job in the adult industry but failed. Maybe the author's comment about child support was a valid point, but perhaps there's a better way to approach it. However, the friend's behavior was pretty toxic with all the insults. The author was defending themselves and pointing out a real issue. \n\nThe mutual friends are taking the friend's side, but maybe they didn't see the context of the insults the author was receiving. The author might not be in the wrong because they were finally standing up for themselves after enduring two years of negativity. It's possible the comment was harsh, but it was a truthful observation. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were responding to ongoing insults with the truth, even if the delivery could have been softer.\n"
