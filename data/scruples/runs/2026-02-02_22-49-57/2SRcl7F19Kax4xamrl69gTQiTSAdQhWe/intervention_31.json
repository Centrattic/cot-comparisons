It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been divorced five times, each time having a child with a different father, and now she's been making some pretty insulting comments towards the author. The author has been trying to brush them off but eventually called out the friend's situation as the reason she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend took offense, hung up, and mutual friends are now saying the author is in the wrong for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship and the context. The friend has been making personal and insulting remarks about the author's appearance, work, and dating life. The author has tried to respond with advice like \"focus on yourself\" and similar, but the friend keeps coming back with more insults. Then, the author finally confronts the friend's situation, which seems to be a valid point\u2014having five kids with different fathers could make it harder to find a stable partner, especially if there's no child support. But the way it's phrased might come across as judgmental or hurtful.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a justified defense against a friend who was being insulting. While the comment might be true, the delivery and context matter. The author was tired of being insulted and responded with a truth they believe applies. However, mutual friends are interpreting it as the author being privileged and not understanding the friend's struggles. The friend's issues are complex, and the author's response might have been a direct but harsh way of pointing out a potential obstacle.\n\nBut then again, the friend was the one making the insults first. The author might have felt attacked and wanted to call out the friend's behavior. However, in friendships, even if someone is being rude, the appropriate response isn't always to reciprocate with criticism. The author's comment could have been intended to help but came off as a personal attack, especially if it wasn't delivered with empathy.\n\nAnother angle is the mutual friends' reactions. They might not see the prior context of the insults and just perceive the author as being judgmental. The author's statement could be seen as invalidating the friend's situation instead of offering support. But the author's perspective is that they were defending themselves after repeated insults.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author's comment was a factual observation about a potential barrier the friend faces, but the way it was delivered might have been hurtful. The friend's behavior was clearly problematic, but the author's response might not have been the best approach. There might be a better way to address the issue without attacking the friend's circumstances, even if those circumstances are part of the problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were responding to a friend who had been insulting them. However, the delivery could have been more constructive. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's a balance between defending oneself and maintaining a supportive friendship. I think the answer is more nuanced, but according to the options given (A or B), the decision is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was responding to a friend's insults and gave a truthful, if blunt, answer, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that even if the friend was being rude, the author shouldn't have retaliated.\n"
