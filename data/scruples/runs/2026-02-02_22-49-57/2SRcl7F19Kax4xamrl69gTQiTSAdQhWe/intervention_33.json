It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers. The friend has been making hurtful comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life for two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been insulting the author repeatedly, and the author tried to brush it off with polite responses. But after a long time of this, the author responds with what they see as the truth. The author's reasoning is that the friend's history with multiple partners and no child support makes it hard for someone to commit. The friend then gets angry and ends the conversation.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are criticizing the author, suggesting they have privilege and are being a bad friend. The author feels they're being unfairly judged because they've worked hard and are not privileged. \n\nI need to think about whether the author's response was justified. The friend was being rude and making untrue comments. The author's reply was a direct answer to the question the friend asked. The author didn't just attack the friend but pointed out a reality that the friend's situation might be affecting her dating life. \n\nBut maybe the way it was said was harsh. Even if the statement is true, the delivery could be considered unkind. Friends are supposed to support each other, so being blunt like that might not be the best approach. However, the author had been enduring two years of insults, which could justify their frustration. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author overstepped, but maybe they're projecting their own biases. The author's intent was to be honest, not to hurt. It's a tough call. In some cases, honesty is necessary, but in a friendship, it's also about how it's communicated. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer hinges on the harshness of the truth, then maybe A. But if the friend was being a jerk for so long, and the author was just standing up for themselves, then B. I think it's a B because the author was responding to a long history of insults with a truthful, if blunt, comment. The author's intent was to address the root cause the friend's question, not to attack. The friends' criticism about privilege might be missing the point of the friend's behavior.\n"
