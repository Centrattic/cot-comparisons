It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insults for two years, and the author finally snapped with a honest but direct response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and insulting, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author had been brushing them off, giving polite advice each time. When the friend asked again about why the author had dates, the author responded by pointing out the friend's situation with multiple children and lack of child support. This led to a fallout.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author have a right to respond with the truth? The friend's comments were hurtful and repeated, which could justify the author's frustration. However, the author's response was a personal critique of the friend's life choices, which might be seen as crossing a line, even if true. The author's answer might have been direct and honest, but it was also a personal attack on the friend's situation. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions are important. They accused the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, suggesting the author's response was insensitive. The author argues they worked hard and aren't privileged. But others might see the author's comment as invalidating the friend's struggles, even if they're not perfect. \n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, the author might have the right to set boundaries if the insults were relentless. However, the way they set that boundary was confrontational. A better approach might have been to explain the impact of the insults without attacking the friend's choices. \n\nThe author's job in the adult industry might also play a role. The friend insulted the job, so the author's frustration is compounded. But responding by pointing out the friend's situation could be seen as deflecting or attacking rather than addressing the issue.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's response was honest but perhaps not the best approach. It's possible they were within their right to express their feelings, but the method could have been less confrontational. However, whether they're in the wrong depends on if the truth of their statement justifies the manner. Since the friend's comments were harmful and the author had been patient, some might argue they were justified. Others might say it's not their place to judge. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because even if the truth was the case, the author's response was a personal attack that could have been delivered more compassionately. However, there's a middle ground. But given the mutual friends' reactions and the potential for insensitivity, the author might be seen as at fault.\n"
