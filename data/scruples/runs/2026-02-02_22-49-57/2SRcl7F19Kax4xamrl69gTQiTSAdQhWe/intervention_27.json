It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life for two years. The author finally responded with a honest but blunt reply, leading to a fallout with mutual friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior was clearly toxic, with repeated insults and personal attacks. The author tried to brush off the comments and even offered positive advice. The final straw was when the friend kept attacking the author's dating success and work in the adult industry. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulties in finding a partner. \n\nNow, the key points here are the nature of the insults and the appropriateness of the response. The author's statement was factual but could be seen as hurtful. However, the friend had been making similar insults that were untrue or hurtful. The author's response might have been a justified defense after enduring two years of negativity. \n\nAnother angle is the mutual friends' reactions. They accused the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author argues that they are not privileged and have worked hard. This could indicate that the friends aren't considering the context of the insults and the author's response as a necessary boundary setting.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's important to be kind, defending oneself against prolonged insults is understandable. The author's response was honest and addressed the root cause the friend pointed to (her situation with multiple children), so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the delivery might have been harsh. But given the friend's history, it's a valid reaction.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were responding to sustained negative behavior and gave a truthful, if blunt, answer. The mutual friends' judgment might be missing the context of the insults the author endured.\n"
