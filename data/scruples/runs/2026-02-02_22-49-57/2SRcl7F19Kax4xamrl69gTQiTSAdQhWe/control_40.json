It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's still single because she has five kids by different fathers and none of them pay child support. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author's appearance, job, and dating life for two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the friend's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was persistently making hurtful remarks, and the author tried to brush them off with polite responses. But the author felt it was justified to reply with the truth about the friend's circumstances. However, the friend took offense and ended the conversation, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author. \n\nThe main question is whether the author crossed a line. Even if the friend was being insulting, the author's response was a direct critique of the friend's personal life. While the author might have felt wronged, calling out someone's behavior as the reason for their situation can be seen as judgmental. Friends might take sides based on their own experiences with privilege or judgment. The author's comment about child support and the number of kids is a sensitive issue, and even if true, bringing it up during an argument could be considered harsh or unsupportive. \n\nThe author's intention was to be honest, but the delivery might have been unkind. The friend's behavior was clearly problematic, but responding with what could be perceived as a personal attack might not have been the best approach. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment made the situation worse. \n\nSo, even though the author had a reason to be defensive, the way they responded might have been inappropriate. Friends often expect support, not judgment. The author could have addressed the insults without directly blaming the friend's past decisions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, despite the friend's initial comments.\n"
