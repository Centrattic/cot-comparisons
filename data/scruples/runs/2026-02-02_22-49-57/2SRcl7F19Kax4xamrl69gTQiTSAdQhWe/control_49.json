It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments about the author's body, job, and dating life. The author has been trying to brush it off but finally called out the friend's situation as a reason for her being single. The friend reacted negatively, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nSo the main question is: was the author justified in making that comment? Let's break it down. The friend's comments were hurtful and untrue, attacking the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author felt targeted and eventually responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a barrier to finding a partner. \n\nThe friend's actions (five kids with different fathers, no child support) might indeed make it harder to find a stable partner, especially if she's looking for someone to be a father figure. The author's response was honest, but maybe it came off as a jab. However, considering the friend's prior insults, the author might have felt justified in defending themselves by pointing out the obvious issue in the friend's life.\n\nOn the other hand, mutual friends are saying the author had no right to make that comment and that it was unkind. The author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, which might be a sensitive topic. But the author also has an MBA and a regular job, so maybe the friends don't understand the context of the author's work.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author crossed a line. The friend was being insulting, and the author was finally standing up for themselves. However, the author's comment might have been a direct attack, even if it was the truth. Sometimes, even if something is true, the way it's delivered and the context matter. The friend was in a vulnerable situation, and pointing out her personal struggles as the reason for her being single could be seen as insensitive, even if the author felt it was justified.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The friend was being insulting for two years, and the author finally said something. The comment was a direct response to the friend's own issues. So in that sense, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending themselves against ongoing insults. However, the mutual friends think the author is privileged, which complicates things. The author might not have intended to be cruel but was being honest.\n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the truth justifies the comment, especially given the history of insults. If the friend was being cruel, the author might have a right to push back. But the delivery might have been harsh. However, the question is not about the delivery but whether the truth is acceptable. Since the author's statement was factually correct (she has five kids with different fathers), pointing that out as a factor in her being single isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it was said could be seen as attacking, which might make the author in the wrong. But considering the friend's prior comments, the author might have been defending themselves.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were responding to ongoing insults and finally addressing the root issue. The friends saying the author is privileged might be missing the point of the ongoing harassment. So the author had a reason to speak up, even if it was harsh.\n"
