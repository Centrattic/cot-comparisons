It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author for two years, and finally, the author just snapped and gave a direct answer. Now, mutual friends are accusing the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has five kids with different fathers and is divorced five times. She's been asking the author how they managed to have a partner and kids at 30, with the author having two kids by the same dad and a 50/50 custody arrangement. The author works in the adult industry but also has a regular job and an MBA. The friend's comments were both questioning and insulting, targeting the author's weight, job, and implying that the author's success is due to being \"basic\" or not good enough.\n\nThe author's response was pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her being single. The friend took offense and ended the conversation. The mutual friends are now supporting the friend, saying the author was harsh and not understanding. The author feels they were just being truthful and are not privileged, working hard for their success.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let me break it down. The friend had been making personal and insulting remarks for two years, which the author tried to brush off. The friend's comments were not only personal but also untrue, like saying the author is skinny or that guys only want basic blondes. The author's own situation is more stable, and perhaps that's a sensitive topic for the friend. \n\nHowever, when the author finally responded with the truth about the friend's five kids, it seems like they targeted a sensitive issue. Even if it's a factual point, bringing it up in a conversation where the friend is clearly struggling and projecting her insecurities onto the author might be seen as cruel. Friends often look for support, not criticism that's based on their personal circumstances. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reaction suggests that the author's approach was hurtful. They mentioned \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement, which the author disputes. But the context is that the friend was in a vulnerable position, and the author's response might have come off as judgmental. While the friend's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's retaliation might have been too harsh. \n\nThere's a balance in friendships between honesty and compassion. The author's truth might be valid, but delivering it in a way that shuts the friend down and causes her to hang up could be seen as not handling it properly. Maybe there was a more supportive way to address the friend's situation without making her feel attacked. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author's statement is factually true, the way it was delivered and the context of the friend's mental state might make the author at fault. The friend was likely in a place where she needed support, not a direct critique of her life choices, especially when the author was responding to her own insults. The author's frustration is understandable, but the timing and method of the response could be problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
