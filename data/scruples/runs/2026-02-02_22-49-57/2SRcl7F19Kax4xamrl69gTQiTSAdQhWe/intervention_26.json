It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their friend that she's single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author's weight and dating life for two years, and eventually, the author snapped back with that truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was making negative and possibly untrue comments, like implying the author's success in dating is due to being skinny, even though the author says they're not skinny. The author also mentions working in the adult industry, which might be a sensitive topic, and the friend had tried that too. The author's response was pointing out the friend's situation with five kids and no child support, which the author believes affects her ability to find a partner.\n\nThe mutual friends are saying the author had \"skinny privilege\" and was being a bad friend. But the author feels they were just being honest and defending themselves after years of insults. The question is whether the author's response was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defensive after repeated insults. They might have felt it was a factual point rather than an insult. But on the other hand, the way it was delivered could be seen as confrontational. Maybe there's a better way to address the issue without being blunt. However, the friend's behavior was also problematic, with constant belittling. The author's response was a culmination of their frustration.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's statement was a truthful response to the friend's situation, even if it was direct. The friend's actions were clearly hurtful, so the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the method of responding could have been more diplomatic. But given the context of ongoing insults, the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
