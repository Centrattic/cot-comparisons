It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's still single because of having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally snapped with a truthful reply. The mutual friends are now accusing the author of being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's comments seem to be both personal and possibly envious or hurtful. She's making fun of the author's weight, job, and relationships, which the author has been brushing off. When the author finally responds with a direct statement about the friend's situation, it leads to a fallout.\n\nThe key issue is whether it was appropriate to call out the friend's situation directly. Even if the author's statement is factually true, the manner in which it was delivered could be problematic. Friends often have boundaries and certain topics they avoid. Bringing up someone's family situation in a judgmental way, even if it's the truth, can come off as harsh and unsupportive, especially if the friend is known to be sensitive or to make inappropriate remarks.\n\nThe author's reply was meant to be honest, but honesty doesn't always equate to being kind or considerate. The friend's reaction suggests that she was not ready to hear that feedback, and the author might have overstepped by making an assumption about her current situation and the reasons for her lack of dates. It's possible that there are other factors at play that the author isn't considering.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' responses indicate that they perceive the author's comment as insensitive. They mention terms like \"privilege\" and \"entitled,\" which are social critiques implying that the author is dismissive of the friend's challenges. Even if the author believes they're being truthful, the context of their relationship and the friend's history of making jokes about others' insecurities might make the author's response seem like a low blow, even if it's technically the truth.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the friend's behavior is clearly problematic, the author's response might have been too direct without considering the friend's feelings or the impact of the words. The better approach could have been to set boundaries without attacking the friend's personal situation. For example, explaining that such comments are hurtful and choosing not to engage further, rather than giving a direct and potentially judgmental answer.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they crossed a line by making a direct, judgmental statement that caused the friend to end the conversation, even if the friend was being rude. The author could have handled it differently without attacking the friend's personal life.\n"
