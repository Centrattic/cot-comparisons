It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers makes it hard to find a partner. The friend was being insulting and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, the friend made a lot of hurtful comments over two years, targeting the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off but eventually responded honestly. The friend reacted badly, leading to mutual friends criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're being judged unfairly.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend's behavior was clearly toxic, making personal attacks. The author's response, while direct, was a factual point about the friend's situation affecting her chances. But the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The author could have handled it more compassionately, but the friend's repeated insults likely contributed to the conflict.\n\nThe key is whether the author crossed a line. The response was honest and addressed the root of the issue (different fathers and child support), which the friend was ignoring. While the method might not have been the best, the content itself was a valid observation. The mutual friends' reactions seem to miss the friend's toxic behavior and the author's valid frustration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Not really. They were defending themselves against ongoing insults. However, there might be a better way to approach it next time. But in this case, the answer is B (No).\n"
