It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their friend that her single status is because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend was giving a lot of insults over two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made repeated comments that were both personal and insulting. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses like \"focus on yourself,\" but the friend kept pushing. Then, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out the five kids with different dads as a barrier to finding someone. That led to a fallout, and mutual friends are now taking sides, saying the author had \"skinny privilege\" and was being a bad friend.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the friend's comments were hurtful and possibly crossed into bullying. The author was defending themselves and pointing out a factual issue that the friend might not have considered. On the other hand, bringing up someone's children in a judgmental way can be very sensitive and might come across as harsh, especially if it's a topic the friend is already struggling with. The mutual friends are on her side, which complicates things because it's a social group that's now against the author.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was a reasonable defense or if it was an overreaction. The author's answer was honest but might have been tactless. Even if the friend had issues, pointing out her situation in such a direct way could be seen as attacking her instead of just standing up for oneself. Also, the author mentions their own job in the adult industry, which might be a sensitive topic they're defending, but that's separate from the main issue.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's behavior was clearly problematic with the constant insults. The author had been patient, but eventually, their response was a reaction to ongoing negativity. However, the way they responded could have been more constructive. Maybe suggesting the friend focus on self-improvement without attacking her situation directly would have been better. Instead, the author made a judgment about the friend's personal choices, which can feel like an attack even if it's based on truth.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions might be influenced by their perception of the situation, possibly missing the context of the friend's prior insults. But the author's response did address the root of the friend's problems, even if it was blunt. The key here is whether the author's statement was a justified response to defend themselves against ongoing insults or if it was an unkind jab that escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid reason to be upset and the friend's comments were inappropriate, the way the author chose to respond might not have been the best approach. However, it's understandable that someone would feel defensive after being insulted repeatedly. The line between defending oneself and being offensive can be thin here. Considering the friend's history, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but the response could have been delivered more tactfully.\n"
