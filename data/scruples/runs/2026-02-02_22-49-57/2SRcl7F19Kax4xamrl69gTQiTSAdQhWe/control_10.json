It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author for two years. The friend is single, has five kids with different fathers, no child support, and seems to be struggling. She keeps asking the author why she, the author, is successful in dating and has a good life, while the friend isn't.\n\nThe author tried to brush off the insults with polite responses, but eventually, when the friend kept pushing, the author told her that having five kids with different dads and no child support makes it hard for someone to commit. That led to the friend getting angry and cutting off, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comments were clearly insults, attacking the author's weight, job, and suggesting that the author's success is superficial (like being a \"basic blonde\"). The author felt that these insults were untrue and low-quality. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a reason for her own difficulties in relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was out of line. The author's friend has a history of making hurtful comments, and the author was defending themselves. However, bringing up the friend's personal issues might be seen as attacking her in return, even if it's a factual statement. The friend's situation is sensitive, and the author's comment could be perceived as judgmental. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was reacting to a long pattern of insults and felt that the friend's behavior was undermining her own experiences. The author's response might have been a way to set a boundary after being insulted repeatedly. However, even if the statement is technically true, it might have been delivered in a way that was hurtful and contributed to the conflict.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that they see the author's comment as crossing a line, especially pointing out the friend's personal struggles as a flaw. The author's job in the adult industry is another sensitive point, and the friend's previous attempts to work there might add to the tension. \n\nBut considering that the friend had been attacking the author for a long time, maybe the author felt justified in pushing back. However, the response focused on the friend's personal situation, which might be more sensitive than the insults the author faced. It's possible that the author's comment was a direct and honest answer but not the most tactful way to handle it. \n\nIn terms of whether it's right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author was responding to years of insults, so self-defense is understandable. But choosing to highlight a sensitive aspect of the friend's life might have been unkind, even if it's a true statement. The key is whether the response was a proportionate and appropriate way to address the ongoing insults. \n\nI think the author's intention was to be honest and set a boundary, but the method might have been harsh. The friend's issues with child support and having multiple children are significant and complex, and pointing that out in a direct manner could be seen as shaming. The author might have been trying to help by pointing out a reality the friend wasn't considering, but it came across as judgmental. \n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards the author being at least partially in the wrong because even if the insults were hurtful, responding with a critique of the friend's personal life might not have been the best approach. However, the friend's prior behavior complicates things. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the mutual friends' reactions, it's possible that the author's response was perceived as crossing a line. So, answer A (Yes) or B (No)? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because the friend was being insulting. The author was defending themselves. But the way they did it might have been unkind. It's a tough call. In situations where someone is attacked for a long time and finally responds, sometimes it's seen as self-defense, but the response's content can still be problematic. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because even though the friend was being mean, the author's response targeted a sensitive personal issue of the friend, which could be seen as shaming. However, some might argue it was a truthful response to a truthful question. But the mutual friends' reactions support that the author did something wrong. So, answer A.\n"
