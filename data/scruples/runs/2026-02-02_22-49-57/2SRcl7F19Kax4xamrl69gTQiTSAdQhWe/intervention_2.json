It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been divorced five times and is now in a situation where she's asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author is a 30-year-old with two kids from the same father, a stable custody arrangement, a job in the adult industry (which they mention isn't their main job), and an MBA. They've been getting tired of their friend's comments, which seem to be both untrue and low-quality. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation with five different fathers and no child support, which the friend took as an attack and ended the conversation. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author feels they've worked hard for what they have.\n\nThe core issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and judgmental. The author tried to brush them off for two years but finally responded with the truth about the friend's circumstances. The author's reply was meant to be honest but might have come off as harsh or blaming. The friend is now upset, and the author is being called a bad friend by others.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, even if the author's statement is factually true, the way it's delivered can impact how it's received. The friend has a history of multiple divorces and possibly unstable relationships, so the author's comment about five different fathers and child support might touch on sensitive issues. While the friend's behavior was rude and unkind, the author's response could be seen as shaming or pointing out her faults in a public or personal way, which might not be supportive even if it's true. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are bringing up \"privilege\" and entitlement, which suggests they feel the author is not acknowledging the friend's struggles. The author's defense is that they are not privileged, but in this context, maybe the friends are reacting to the author's comment as if it's a judgment rather than support. The author's main point is that the friend has made choices leading to her current situation, and the author is tired of being insulted. \n\nHowever, even if the friend was asking for advice, the author's response could be perceived as attacking her rather than offering constructive feedback. The author might have been trying to be honest, but the friend's insecurities and past experiences could make her more sensitive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would depend on whether the truth was delivered in a way that was unkind or unnecessary. The author was responding to a friend who was being hurtful, so their response could be seen as a form of boundaries. But some might argue that pointing out the friend's personal life in a way that could be seen as judgmental is not the right approach. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe the method could have been better. However, the user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nAlternatively, considering the support for the friend from mutual friends, maybe the author's truth was misunderstood. The author's response is factual but perhaps not the right way to handle the situation. In terms of being a good friend, sometimes honesty is necessary, but it's important to consider the delivery and context. The friend was in a vulnerable position, and the author's comment might have exacerbated that. But the author was also defending themselves from ongoing insults. \n\nI think the key here is that the author was responding to a friend who was being unkind and unappreciative. Even if the response was harsh, the underlying issue is the friend's behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the truth, especially since the friend's actions (insulting) were already problematic. However, the way it was said could have been softer. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they were addressing the truth of the matter in response to their friend's harmful comments.\n"
