It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend about her situation with five kids and different fathers.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making comments that are pretty harsh and insulting. The author tried to brush them off for two years, giving supportive answers each time. But eventually, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out her situation with the kids and child support. The friend took offense, and now mutual friends are siding with her, saying the author was privileged and harsh.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the friend was being insulting and the author was defending themselves. But the way the author responded was pretty direct and maybe hurtful. Even if the comment was true, bringing up someone's personal issues in a judgmental way might not be the best approach. The author's friend was likely sensitive about her situation, and the comment could have felt like a personal attack, even if it's true.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the comment was out of line, even if the author's intention was to give an honest answer. The key here is whether the author had the right to make that comment, especially after the friend was already being critical. Maybe the author could have addressed the insults without bringing up the friend's personal life in a judgmental way. There might have been a better, kinder way to respond without shaming her.\n\nBut the author felt attacked and was defending themselves. That adds complexity. However, even when people are being mean, responding with a personal jab might not be the right way to handle it. It's important to consider the impact of one's words, especially when discussing sensitive topics like child support and relationship issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's response, while perhaps a reaction to being insulted, was probably not the right approach. It's possible they were defending their own worth but ended up hurting their friend. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they chose to respond, even if the underlying issue wasn't their fault."
