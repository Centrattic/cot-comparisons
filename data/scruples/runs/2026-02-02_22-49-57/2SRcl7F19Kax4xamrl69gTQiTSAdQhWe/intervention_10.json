It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been divorced five times and now is single with five kids from different fathers. The friend keeps making comments that are a bit insulting to the author, asking about how the author is successful in relationships and implying things about body image, job, and such. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with the five kids and no child support might be a reason she's having trouble finding someone. The friend gets upset, and now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong for being critical and having \"privilege.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was honest but maybe not the best way to handle it. The friend was being rude and making personal attacks, so the author was just trying to point out the obvious. The author mentions they worked hard and have an MBA, so maybe they feel justified in pointing out the friend's situation. But on the other hand, bringing up the friend's personal issues in a confrontational way might not be the best approach. Even if the friend was being mean, the author's comment could come off as judgmental. \n\nThe author says they were tired of being insulted and wanted to respond with the truth. But was it necessary to say it the way they did? Maybe there's a more constructive way to offer advice without being so direct. Also, the mutual friends are saying the author has privilege, which might be a point. The author's friend's situation is complex, and the author's comment might have hit a sensitive spot. However, the author was responding after two years of being mocked, so it's understandable they felt the need to set a boundary. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was cruel versus honest. Since the author was trying to be truthful and had a valid point, but the way they delivered it might have been harsh. However, considering the friend was being insulting, the author's response was a reaction to that. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because they were honest and had their own experiences to draw from. The friends might be projecting or not seeing the context of the insults. So, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
