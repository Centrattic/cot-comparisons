He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, depending on the jurisdiction. Since the girl is 18, it's legally permissible for both parties to be in a relationship. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying the girl was underage at the time, but now she's 18. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author's friend is an adult, and the girl is also an adult. Both are capable of making their own decisions. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life, possibly out of concern. However, is it right for the author to take such actions as trying to prevent the relationship? The author has approached the girl directly and is trying to keep them apart. That seems like overstepping because it's not their place to dictate their friend's romantic choices. \n\nThe friend hasn't forced the girl into anything. The relationship seems to be developing consensually, though there's some ambiguity about the girl's intentions. But the author's actions, like trying to find ways to keep them apart, might be based on their own discomfort rather than the friend's well-being. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the age difference\u201413 years\u2014could be a personal opinion. While a 13-year age gap might raise eyebrows, both parties are adults and can decide what they're comfortable with. The author's justification is that the girl \"looks\" younger, but that's a superficial judgment. \n\nThe friend's loneliness and past experiences with women are mentioned. The author might be trying to help, but by interfering, they might be causing more harm, like making the friend feel even more isolated. The approach of using another friend to actively prevent the relationship could be seen as manipulative or controlling.\n\nIn summary, the author is acting on their own concerns without being in a position to control the friend's romantic life. The actions taken (directly approaching the girl, trying to keep them apart) go beyond advice and into interference. Legally, there's no problem. Ethically, the author is overstepping by interfering in a consensual adult relationship between two people.\n"
