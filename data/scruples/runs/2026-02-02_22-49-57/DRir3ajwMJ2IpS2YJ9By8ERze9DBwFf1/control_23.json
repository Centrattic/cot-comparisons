He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But the author feels the girl looks younger, maybe even 16, and is concerned because it's close to the age of consent. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them from getting together. The girl isn't thrilled about the idea but laughed shyly when told it's not a good idea. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with girls before.\n\nHmm, the key points here are legality versus personal opinion. The author's main argument is that the girl is too young, but legally, she's an adult. The author's actions are based on their own discomfort and concern for their friend. But does that give them the right to interfere? Friendship often involves giving advice, but where's the line between helping and overstepping?\n\nThe friend is an adult and can make their own decisions. Even if the author thinks the relationship is a bad idea, they can't legally stop them. The girl is also an adult, so she can choose who she wants to date. The author might be projecting their own feelings of the girl being too young because of her appearance, not actual age. Also, the friend is seeking companionship, which is valid. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to meddle? Probably not. They can express their concerns, but actively trying to prevent the relationship by keeping them apart could be overstepping. The girl's reaction was shy laughter, so maybe she's not against the idea, but the author is imposing their opinion. The author might be in the right to express their worries, but the actions taken (like trying to keep them apart) might be wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for expressing concerns, but the actions they take could be seen as overstepping. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the actions are interfering in a way that's not their decision to make, then maybe A (Yes). But legally, they can't be wrong for expressing concern. However, the act of trying to prevent the relationship could be considered meddling. The line between caring and controlling. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're acting out of concern for their friend's well-being, even if their methods are questionable. Since the relationship is legal, the author can't be wrong for trying to advise, but the situation is complicated. The question is about being in the wrong, and since there's no legal issue, maybe the answer is B.\n"
