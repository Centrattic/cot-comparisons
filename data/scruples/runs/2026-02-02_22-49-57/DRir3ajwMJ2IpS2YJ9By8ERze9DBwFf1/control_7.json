He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so legally, it's allowed. However, there's a big age gap here. The girl is 18, which is the minimum legal age, but the friend is 31, so a 13-year gap. Some might see this as a significant difference, even if it's legal.\n\nThen, the writer's intentions. They mention their friend has had bad luck with relationships and is lonely. The writer is concerned about their friend's well-being and is trying to protect him. But is it their place to intervene? The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The writer is trying to control their friend's choices, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the writer approached the girl directly and told her it's a bad idea. That's crossing a boundary because the girl isn't the writer's responsibility. They might be imposing their own judgment on her, which isn't fair. The girl is an adult too and should have the autonomy to decide her own relationships.\n\nAnother point is the writer's personal discomfort. They say the age gap makes them uncomfortable, but that's subjective. Just because it feels wrong to them doesn't mean it's wrong for their friend. The writer is projecting their own feelings onto the situation.\n\nThe friend is an adult, so he has the right to date whoever he chooses. The writer's actions (trying to keep them apart) could be seen as manipulative or controlling. However, they might be acting out of concern for their friend's happiness and to avoid potential issues down the line.\n\nBut in the end, unless there's actual harm or illegal activity, adults should be free to choose their partners. The writer isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be overstepping by interfering in their friend's personal life and the girl's choices. The correct answer is probably that the writer is in the wrong (A) because they're not the one to make that decision for their friend and the girl.\n"
