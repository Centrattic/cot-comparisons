He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them, even telling the girl it's a bad idea. The question is whether the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal age of consent. In most places, 18 is the legal age, so technically there's no crime here. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, but now it's legal. So legally, there's no issue. But the author is concerned about the age gap. The girl is 18, which is just a year younger than the legal age she was previously. The author thinks she looks younger, but that's subjective.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The author is trying to influence both friends and the girl. The girl seems to show interest, so maybe she's not a child but a young adult. The author's friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships, so the author is trying to help. But is it their place to make that decision for their friend? The friend is an adult, so he should have autonomy in his relationships. The author might have good intentions, but they're not the ones in the relationship. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're actively trying to keep them apart. Also, the author is manipulating the girl by telling her it's a bad idea without her consent, which might be a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the girl's agency. If she's 18 and capable of making her own decisions, then the author shouldn't be the one to decide for her. Even if she looks younger, she's an adult. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with age gaps. The friend's loneliness is a valid issue, but that doesn't mean the author can prevent him from pursuing a relationship he wants, as long as it's consensual.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is concerned about their friend's well-being. Maybe the girl isn't a good match. But the author isn't in their friend's relationship, so they can't judge that. They should probably advise their friend to make his own choices. The author's methods of trying to prevent the relationship by manipulating both parties could be harmful, even if their intentions are good.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect their friend, the way they're acting is overstepping boundaries. The friend and the girl are both adults and can make their own decisions. The author has no right to interfere in their personal choices unless there's clear harm involved, which isn't mentioned here. So the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
