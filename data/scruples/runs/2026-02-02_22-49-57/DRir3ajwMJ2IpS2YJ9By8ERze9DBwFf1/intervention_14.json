He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The author's main concern is that the girl seems too young, even though both are legally adults. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent varies by jurisdiction, but in many places, 18 is the age where someone can legally consent to relationships. So the friend isn't doing anything illegal. The author is worried about the age gap and the girl's maturity level. However, the girl is an adult, even if she appears younger. The author is interfering by trying to discourage both friends, which might be overstepping. \n\nFriendship often involves giving advice, but where does it cross into being in the wrong? The author's actions include directly telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep them apart. That could be seen as meddling. The friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own decisions. Unless there's a clear risk of harm, like exploitation, the author's intervention might not be justified. \n\nThe author mentions the girl might be \"16 or something,\" but she is 18. Assuming she's a minor when she's not could be problematic. The author's own judgment about the girl's maturity is subjective. Even if the girl seems young, it's her choice who she's interested in. The author's actions might be based on personal discomfort rather than the girl's actual situation.\n\nSo, the key points: legal consent is there. The author is intervening without a clear ethical or legal justification. The friend is an adult who can make his own decisions. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, the author's actions are overstepping. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
