He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's 31-year-old friend wants to get close to an 18-year-old girl. The author and another friend are trying to stop them from getting together. The main question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. The girl is 18, which is the age of majority in most places in the US. So, legally, there's no issue with them dating. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, maybe because the girl was a minor. But now she's 18. So legally, the author can't argue on that ground anymore.\n\nNext, the author is concerned about the age difference. The girl is 18, and the guy is 31. That's a 13-year gap. But both are adults. However, the author thinks the girl looks younger, maybe like a 16-year-old. But appearance doesn't determine actual age. Since she's 18, legally, she's an adult. The author might be worried about the girl's maturity level, but that's subjective. The author isn't in a position to judge the girl's maturity or intentions.\n\nThe author has directly told the girl it's not a good idea. That could be seen as intervening in someone else's personal life without their consent. The girl laughed shyly, so maybe she's not convinced. The author is also trying to prevent the guy from pursuing her, which might be interfering with his autonomy. The friend is lonely, so the author might be acting out of concern, but is that their right?\n\nEthically, the author isn't the girl's parent or the friend's parent. They have a right to their own relationships. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, the author shouldn't meddle. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, trying to control others' romantic choices. The fact that the author and friend are trying to find ways to keep them apart suggests they're taking it too far. Even if their intentions are good, they don't have the authority to dictate who the friend can date.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is meddlesome. The legal age is met, and the decision to date is up to the individuals involved. Unless there's a clear risk of harm, the author shouldn't intervene. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
