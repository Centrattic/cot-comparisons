He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The writer is concerned about the age difference, even though both are adults. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, a 31-year-old dating an 18-year-old is legal. But the writer feels it's too young, maybe because the girl looks younger, and they're worried about the power dynamic or the girl's maturity level. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Should friends interfere in someone else's romantic choices? The writer is trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak, thinking the girl isn't a good match. But is that their place to decide? The friend is an adult, so he has the right to make his own decisions, even if others don't agree.\n\nThe writer's actions include directly advising the girl against it and trying to keep them apart. That might be crossing a line, especially if the girl isn't forced into anything. The girl seems interested, so maybe the writer is being overbearing without a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions the friend is lonely and has had bad experiences. Maybe the writer is projecting their own biases or fears onto the situation. The key here is whether the relationship is consensual and legal. Since it is, the writer might not have the right to intervene. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the writer is in the wrong (A) because they're interfering in a consensual adult relationship without a valid legal or ethical justification. But I need to be careful about cultural norms and the writer's intentions. However, in most cases, adults have autonomy over their romantic choices unless there's harm involved, which isn't indicated here.\n"
