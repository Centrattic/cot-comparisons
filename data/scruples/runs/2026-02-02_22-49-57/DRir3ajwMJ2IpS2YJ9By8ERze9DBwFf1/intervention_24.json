He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the writer trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The writer thinks the girl is too young, even though both are adults. They've tried discouraging both the friend and the girl, and are considering other ways to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. But the writer feels uncomfortable because the girl looks younger, maybe like a 16-year-old. The friend is 31, so there's a 13-year age gap. The writer is concerned about the power dynamics and the girl's maturity level. However, the girl is at least 18, so legally, it's allowed. \n\nNext, the ethical side. The writer is acting out of concern for their friend, thinking the girl might not be a suitable match. But is it ethical for the writer to interfere in their friend's personal life? The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The writer is making assumptions about the girl's intentions and maturity based on her appearance. The friend is also feeling lonely and might see this as a genuine connection. \n\nThe writer's actions include directly telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to find ways to keep them apart. That could be seen as overstepping. Even if the writer's intentions are good, they're not the ones involved in the relationship. The girl is also an adult, so she's entitled to make her own choices. The writer's interference might be hindering their friend's autonomy and happiness, unless there's clear evidence of harm. \n\nAnother angle: the writer's friend has struggled with relationships before. This girl seems interested, even if not sure. The writer's actions might prevent their friend from exploring a potential positive relationship, especially if it's consensual and legal. The writer's discomfort based on the girl's appearance is subjective. Just because she looks younger doesn't mean she's not mature enough to consent. \n\nSo, putting it all together. Legally, there's no issue. Ethically, the writer is interfering in their friend's life without clear justification beyond their own discomfort. The friend is an adult, so the writer isn't in a position to make decisions for them. Even if the writer has good intentions, the actions taken (directly talking to the girl, trying to prevent the relationship) are likely overstepping. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong.\n"
