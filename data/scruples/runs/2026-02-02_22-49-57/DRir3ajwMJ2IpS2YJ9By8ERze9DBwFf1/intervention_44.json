He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: both are adults, so legally, it's allowed. But the author feels it's too young, comparing her to a 16-year-old. There's a big age gap here\u201413 years. Even though the girl is 18, there's a perception of youth. The author is worried about the girl being a \"real\" adult, maybe not mature enough. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. Age gaps in relationships can be controversial, especially when one is significantly older. The author's friend is 31, which is an age where people are often more established. The girl is just turning 18, which is a new adult age for many, so she might be less experienced. The author is trying to protect both friends, but how appropriate is that interference?\n\nThe author is taking action by talking to both parties. They told the girl it's not a good idea, and the girl reacted with a shy laugh, not taking it seriously. The author is also trying to keep them apart. This raises the question of overstepping. Friends can give advice, but actively trying to prevent a relationship can be problematic unless there's a clear harm.\n\nAlso, the author's friend is lonely and has had bad luck with relationships. The author might be acting out of concern, but maybe not considering his autonomy. The line between helping and controlling can be thin. The other friend is involved too, so it's a group effort, which might add pressure on the individuals.\n\nAnother angle: the author's feelings about the situation. They say it \"creeps them out,\" which is a personal reaction, not a legal or ethical one. It's important to respect others' choices even if they don't align with our personal preferences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not breaking the law, but are they violating social norms? Maybe. It's about consent and personal agency. The girl is an adult, and if she's interested, that's her choice. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the situation. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, it's their choice to pursue a relationship. The author's actions could be seen as meddling. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they're interfering with adults' decisions, even if their intentions are good.\n"
