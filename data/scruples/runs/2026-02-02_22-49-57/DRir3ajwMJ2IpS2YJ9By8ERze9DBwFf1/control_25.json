He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, but the author thinks the girl looks much younger and is concerned about the age gap.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. Since the girl is 18, it's legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now it's okay. So legally, there's no issue here. The author's concern is more about the perceived maturity gap rather than legality.\n\nNext, the social aspect. Age gaps in relationships can be a sensitive topic. While the author is worried about the girl being immature, as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice. The author's actions involve actively trying to prevent the relationship, which might be overstepping. The author isn't a parent or legal guardian, so they don't have the authority to make that decision for their friend or the girl. \n\nThe author's motivations are important. They might be genuinely concerned about their friend's well-being, thinking he's better suited for someone closer in age. But by interfering, they could be infringing on their friend's autonomy. The friend is an adult and should be able to make his own choices, even if others disagree. The author's approach\u2014discouraging the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014might be seen as meddling in a way that isn't their place.\n\nAlso, the girl's perspective matters. If she's showing genuine interest, even if she's young, she has the right to make her own decisions. The author's judgment about her maturity could be inaccurate. People mature at different rates, and someone who looks younger might still be emotionally ready for a relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's concern isn't baseless. A 13-year age gap can lead to different life stages and challenges. But unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, it's up to the individuals involved. The author's actions might stem from a desire to protect their friend, but the method is questionable. They should focus on supporting their friend's emotional well-being rather than dictating his choices.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, they are overstepping by taking action to prevent a consensual relationship between two adults. The right to make personal choices, even if others disagree, is a fundamental aspect of adulthood. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
