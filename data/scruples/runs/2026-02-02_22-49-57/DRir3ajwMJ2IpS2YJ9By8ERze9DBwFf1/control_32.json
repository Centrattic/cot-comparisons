He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is a factor here. In most places, 18 is the age of majority, so it's legal for them to date. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger and the age gap seems large. However, the legality itself isn't the issue here since they're both adults.\n\nNext, the author's motivations. They're concerned about their friend's past loneliness and lack of success with women. The author might be trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak or what they perceive as an imbalanced relationship. But is it their place to interfere? The friend is an adult, capable of making his own decisions, even if others disagree.\n\nThe approach taken by the author includes directly telling the girl it's not a good idea and trying to keep them apart. This could be seen as overstepping. The girl was told outright, which might pressure her or her feelings. Also, the author is manipulating the situation by keeping them separate, which isn't respectful of either person's autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is consent and maturity. The girl is 18, which is the legal age, but if she's perceived as acting younger, that's different from her actual age. The author might be worried about maturity levels rather than just age. However, that's subjective and not for others to judge. The key here is whether the relationship is consensual and both parties are of legal age.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be driven by their own discomfort rather than objective harm. Age-gap relationships are common and can work if both people are mature. The author's intervention might stem from their friend's loneliness and their own biases about age differences.\n\nIn summary, while the author has good intentions, they are not in a position to dictate the relationship choices of their friend or the girl. The best approach would be to talk to their friend about their concerns rather than try to interfere. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
