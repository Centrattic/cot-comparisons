He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, the relationship is technically legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which suggests that maybe the girl is just turning 18, so it's now legal. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the social and ethical dimensions. The author is concerned about the age gap. 31 and 18 is a 13-year difference. Even though both are adults, some people might see this as a significant age gap. However, others might argue that as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice. The author is interfering because they think the girl is too young and \"might as well be 16,\" which could be a subjective judgment. The girl is showing genuine interest, and the friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with women before. \n\nThe author is trying to prevent the relationship by discouraging both the friend and the girl. The friend is being advised by someone else, which might be overstepping. Friends can give advice, but pushing to keep them apart without their consent could be seen as manipulative. The girl was directly told it wouldn't be a good idea, which might violate her autonomy. \n\nAnother point is the author's own motives. They might be trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak or social judgment, but they are making assumptions about the girl's intentions and the relationship's viability. The friend's loneliness and past struggles could mean that this is a chance for him to connect, even if it's not ideal. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the key points are consent, autonomy, and the right to make personal choices. Since both are adults, the right to date is theirs. The author's actions could be seen as meddlesome, even if well-intentioned. However, some might argue that the author is concerned about their friend's well-being and is trying to prevent a potentially unhealthy relationship. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author has the right to interfere. The friend is an adult and can choose his own partners. The author's actions, like trying to keep them apart and advising the girl not to date him, cross the line from advice to interference. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they are interfering in the relationship without the consent of either party, even if their intentions are to protect their friend. The legal and ethical standards here support the autonomy of both individuals involved.\n"
