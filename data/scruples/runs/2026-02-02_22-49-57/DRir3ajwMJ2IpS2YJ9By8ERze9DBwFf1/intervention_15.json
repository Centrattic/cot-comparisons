He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend wanting to prevent his 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The writer is concerned about the age difference, even though both are adults.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the legal age of consent is 18, so technically, if both parties are adults, there's no legal issue. However, the writer feels that the girl looks younger and might be 16, which would make it illegal. But the girl is actually 18, so legally, it's okay. So maybe the concern is more about perception than legality.\n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. The writer is stepping in to prevent their friend from pursuing this relationship. They've directly told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea and are trying to keep the two apart. The friend is feeling lonely and maybe desperate, which could make him more vulnerable. The writer's intention is to protect their friend from what they see as a bad decision.\n\nBut wait, is it the writer's place to make that decision for their friend? The friend is an adult, so he has the right to make his own romantic choices. The writer's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if their intentions are good. The writer is essentially trying to control the friend's personal life, which might not be appropriate unless there's immediate harm involved.\n\nAlso, the writer is acting on their own judgment without knowing the girl's intentions. The girl might be genuinely interested in the friend, and the writer's interference could prevent a valid relationship. Plus, the writer and their friend are trying to keep them apart, which could be seen as manipulative, especially if they're using underhanded tactics.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might be concerned about the friend's emotional well-being. If the friend is not getting proper attention or is being taken advantage of, the writer's concern is valid. However, the writer should approach it by having an open conversation with their friend, not by trying to sabotage the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's intentions might be to protect their friend, interfering in another adult's romantic decisions without clear evidence of harm is likely overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
