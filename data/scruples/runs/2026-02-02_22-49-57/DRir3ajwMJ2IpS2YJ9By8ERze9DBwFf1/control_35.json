He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, the girl is 18. Legally, in most places, both are adults, so there's no legal issue. But the poster feels the girl looks younger, maybe like 16, which makes them uncomfortable. They've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl, even telling the girl it's a bad idea. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with women before.\n\nI need to consider a few things here. The main ethical points: the right to consensual relationships, the poster's role as a friend, and the potential for the poster overstepping.\n\nConsent is key here. Both individuals are adults, so their relationship, if consensual, is their own business. The poster is interfering without clear justification beyond their own discomfort. It's possible the girl is 18 and mature, and the poster is assuming immaturity based on appearance, which could be a form of ageism or stereotyping.\n\nAs a friend, the poster might be acting out of concern, but that doesn't mean they have the right to control who their friend dates. The poster mentions that the girl seems interested, so maybe there's a genuine connection. The poster's actions could be seen as undermining both individuals' autonomy.\n\nAlso, the poster is using another friend to keep them apart, which could be manipulative. The friend might not even have the right to know if the relationship is consensual unless there's harm involved. The poster's reasons are largely based on personal discomfort and societal norms about age gaps rather than any actual harm.\n\nSo, the conclusion here is that the poster is overstepping by interfering in a consensual adult relationship. Their actions are based on personal judgment without valid reason. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
