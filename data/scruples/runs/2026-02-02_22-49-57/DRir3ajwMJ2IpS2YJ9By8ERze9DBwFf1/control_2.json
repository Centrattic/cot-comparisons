He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's okay for the author to try to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. Both people are adults, so in most places, there's no legal issue. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, maybe because the girl was 17 at the time. Now that she's 18, legally, their relationship is okay. So the author can't use legality as a basis for disapproval anymore.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning. The girl \"looks 16\" and seems too young. But appearance isn't the same as legal age. The author is worried about the age difference, but since both are adults, it's their choice. The author is also concerned about the friend's loneliness and the friend's past issues with relationships. However, the author's actions\u2014confronting the girl and trying to keep them apart\u2014seem intrusive. \n\nIs it the author's place to interfere? Friends can express their opinions, but actively trying to prevent a relationship by manipulating or keeping them apart might be overstepping. The girl seems interested, and the author told her it's a bad idea, which could be seen as meddling. The friend is an adult and should make his own decisions, even if the author disagrees. \n\nThere's a line between concern and control. The author might genuinely care, but the method of interference could be wrong. The answer might depend on cultural views on age gaps and personal autonomy. But since both are adults, the author isn't in the wrong legally or morally by trying to dissuade them, but the approach might be questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the actions are about trying to prevent a legal relationship between two adults, the answer might lean towards the author being wrong (A) because they're not the ones to decide for their friend.\n"
