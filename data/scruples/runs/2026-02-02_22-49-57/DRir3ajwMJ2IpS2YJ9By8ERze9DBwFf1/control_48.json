He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The girl is 18, so in most places, that's the legal age of consent. So legally, there's no issue. The writer mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, but now it's okay. So legally, the friend isn't doing anything wrong.\n\nThen there's the ethical part. The writer is trying to stop their friend because they think the girl is too young. But since she's 18, which is the legal age, maybe the writer's concern is more about maturity. The girl might look younger, but age isn't everything. The writer is assuming that the girl is not mature enough, but that's a judgment call. Also, the girl shows genuine interest, which complicates things.\n\nThe writer is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The friend is feeling lonely and the writer's actions might be seen as overstepping. Friends can give advice, but preventing their friend from making a choice, especially if both parties are adults, could be considered meddling. The girl's autonomy is important here; the writer is making a decision for her by telling her it's not a good idea.\n\nAnother angle: the writer's motivation. They're trying to help their friend avoid what they perceive as a bad situation. But their actions are controlling. The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The writer might have good intentions, but they're not the one in the relationship. It's possible that the writer is projecting their own discomfort with the age difference.\n\nAlso, the writer's friend is 31, so the age difference is 13 years. While that's a significant gap, it's not illegal. Society often has different views on age gaps, but as long as both are adults, it's their choice. The writer's actions could be seen as violating their friend's right to romantic autonomy.\n\nIn summary, the legal aspect is clear\u2014no issue. The ethical side is about respecting autonomy. The writer is interfering in a way that might not be their place. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they're preventing adults from making their own choices based on their own judgment, even if the writer has concerns.\n"
