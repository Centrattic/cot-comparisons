He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let's break this down. Both are adults, so legally, the age of consent is probably not an issue here since 18 is the legal age. But the author is concerned about the girl acting younger, maybe like 16. That part is a bit tricky because legally she's an adult, but maybe there's a perception of her being underage. The author and another friend have been actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to both the girl and the friend, even though the girl didn't take it seriously. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, as long as the girl is 18 or older, the relationship is legal. But if she's acting younger, maybe there's a question about her maturity. However, the author can't determine the girl's intentions or maturity just by looking at her or observing briefly. That might be a hasty judgment.\n\nEthically, the author is worried about the power dynamic. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old could have a significant age gap, which might affect the relationship's equality. But if both are consenting adults, that's their choice. The author's role as a friend is to express concerns, but they can't control their friend's decisions. \n\nThe approach the author took\u2014talking to the girl and trying to discourage the friend\u2014might be seen as overstepping. The girl is within her legal rights to choose who she dates, even if the author feels she's being led on. However, the author might be acting out of genuine concern for their friend's well-being and the potential pitfalls of a large age gap. \n\nBut is it the author's place to intervene this way? They might be violating their friend's right to make personal choices. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, friends should ideally support each other's decisions even if they don't agree. The author's actions could be perceived as controlling or not respecting their friend's autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal and consensual relationship, even if their intentions are good. The key point is that both individuals are adults and can make their own decisions, and the author shouldn't dictate that for them without a valid reason.\n"
