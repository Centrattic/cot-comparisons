He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: both are adults. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so legally, there's no issue. But the author is concerned about the age gap and the girl's maturity level. They mention she looks younger and that just a few months ago it would have been illegal. That part is confusing because if she's now 18, then it's legal now. Maybe the girl had a birthday recently?\n\nThe author is trying to dissuade their friend from pursuing this relationship, even talking to the girl directly. The friend is lonely and has had bad experiences. The author's intention is to protect their friend, thinking he might be getting taken advantage of or that the relationship isn't healthy due to the age gap.\n\nBut where's the line between concern and overstepping? The author is interfering in their friend's personal life. While they have good intentions, they might be assuming the girl isn't interested or that the relationship is doomed. They also spoke to the girl directly, which could be crossing a boundary. The girl's reaction was to laugh shyly, which might mean she's not interested or just feels awkward.\n\nIs it the author's place to intervene? Friends often give advice, but trying to actively prevent a relationship might be overstepping. The author isn't the one in the relationship; they can't know the full context. The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions, even if they seem unwise.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author believes the girl is manipulating their friend (e.g., because she's much younger and he's lonely), then there's a concern about power dynamics. But the author's actions\u2014talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart\u2014could be seen as meddling. Unless there's evidence of exploitation, it's not their responsibility to interfere.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are good, but the actions might be overreaching. They should probably advise their friend rather than try to control the situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent the relationship without a valid reason beyond their own discomfort with the age difference.\n"
