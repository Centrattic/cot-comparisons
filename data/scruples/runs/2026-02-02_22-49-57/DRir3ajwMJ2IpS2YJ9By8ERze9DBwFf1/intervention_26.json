He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legally okay. The person mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which implies the girl was under 18 then. But now she's 18, so it's legal. So legally, there's no issue. But the author feels the girl is too young in appearance and might act younger. But that's subjective.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if the girl is 18, does the age difference matter? The friend is 31, so a 13-year gap. Some people might find that a big difference, but others don't. The author is worried about the girl being immature, but that's not for the author to decide. The girl might be mature for her age. The author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart, which could be seen as overstepping. The friend has the right to choose who they date, unless there's harm involved. The author's actions could be considered meddling in their friend's personal life. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has been lonely and the situation is a result of the friend's loneliness. The author's intentions might be good, but they're not the one making the decision. The key point is autonomy in relationships. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, the author shouldn't be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
