He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent his friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But the author feels she looks much younger, like 16, and that a relationship would be inappropriate. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them from getting together. The author even directly told the girl it's not a good idea, and the girl just laughed shyly. The friend is feeling lonely and hasn't had much success with relationships, which is why he's interested in the girl.\n\nNow, considering the age difference: in many places, the legal age of consent is 18, so as long as the girl is 18 or older, it's legal. However, the author is concerned about the perceived age difference and the potential for a power imbalance. But since the girl is 18, she's an adult, so it's a consensual relationship between two adults. The author's main issue seems to be with the age gap and the girl's maturity level, not legality or coercion.\n\nBut what about the author's right to intervene? The author is a friend, so he's concerned about his friend's well-being. However, relationships are personal choices. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, it's up to the individuals involved. The author is taking it upon himself to influence their decisions, which might not be his place. He's even told the girl directly, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend is feeling lonely and the girl shows some genuine interest, even if it's unclear. The author's actions might stem from a place of concern, but he's not the one involved in the relationship. The girl is an adult, so she can make her own decisions. The author might be projecting his own discomfort with the age difference, but that doesn't make it his responsibility to stop them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship is consensual and legal, then the author has no right to interfere. His actions could be considered intrusive and potentially harmful by undermining the girl's autonomy and his friend's agency. Unless there's clear evidence of harm or non-consent, the author is overstepping. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
