He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop him. \n\nFirst, legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so technically, 31 and 18 is legal. But the author mentions that the girl looks younger, maybe 16, and just a few months ago it would have been illegal. That part is confusing. If the girl is actually 18, then it's legal, but maybe the author is concerned about her maturity level.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The friend is lonely and struggling, and the girl might be showing genuine interest. The author and another friend are interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The question is whether this interference is justified.\n\nThe author's intentions seem to be protective, thinking the girl is too young, but they aren't the ones in a relationship here. The 18-year-old is an adult, so even if she looks younger, she has the right to make her own choices. The author isn't the one engaging in the relationship, so maybe they overstep by trying to control their friend's actions. \n\nAlso, the friend is an adult, so he should be able to make his own decisions about whom to date. The author's actions could be seen as meddling and not respecting their friend's autonomy. Unless there's a clear sign of manipulation or the girl isn't mature enough, the author might not have the right to intervene this way. \n\nBut maybe there's a valid concern if the girl is genuinely not mature. However, since she's 18, it's her choice. The author's judgment is based on appearance, which isn't a solid basis. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering without a legal or ethical justification.\n"
