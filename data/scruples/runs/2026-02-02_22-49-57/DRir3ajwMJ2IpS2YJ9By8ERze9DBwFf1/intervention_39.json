He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend has had trouble with relationships and is feeling lonely. The girl is technically an adult, but the author feels she looks much younger and is concerned about the age difference. The author and another friend have been trying to discourage their friend and the girl from dating.\n\nHmm. First, the legal aspect: in many places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. But the author is worried about the girl's maturity because she looks younger. But just because someone looks younger doesn't mean they aren't mature enough. The girl is 18, so she's an adult, and it's her choice who she dates. The author is interfering by talking to her directly and trying to stop their friend from pursuing her.\n\nThe author's intentions might be to protect their friend from potential issues, like an unbalanced relationship due to the age gap. But is it the author's place to make that decision? The friend is an adult too. The author's friend has the right to choose who they date, even if others think it's a bad idea. The author might be overstepping by trying to control the situation, especially by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that \"just a couple of months ago it would be illegal\" doesn't really hold because once you're 18, the legal age is met. The author's actions could be seen as manipulating the situation and not respecting their friend's autonomy. Unless there's actual evidence of the girl being underage or being taken advantage of, the author has no right to interfere. The girl is making her own choices, and the author's interference might be more about their own discomfort than the well-being of their friend.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because they're interfering in their friend's personal life without justification beyond their own concerns.\n"
