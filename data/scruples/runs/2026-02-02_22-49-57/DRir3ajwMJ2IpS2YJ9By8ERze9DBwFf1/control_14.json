He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from pursuing an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal age of consent. The girl is 18, which is the legal age in most places. So, technically, they can date if both are adults. But the writer feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger. However, looks don't determine legality. The writer's main issue seems to be about social norms and their own discomfort.\n\nThe friend is feeling lonely and hasn't had much success with relationships. The writer is trying to protect their friend from potential regret or exploitation, but they haven't consulted the girl's perspective. The girl is showing interest, though maybe not clear. The writer might be overstepping by intervening without the girl's input.\n\nBut wait, the writer isn't the one in the relationship. They can express their opinion, but should they take it further? Maybe by actively trying to keep them apart, they're infringing on the friend's autonomy. The friend is an adult and can make their own decisions, even if the writer disagrees. Unless there's a clear power imbalance or harm, the writer might not have the right to interfere that much.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer's concern isn't entirely unfounded. The age difference is 13 years, which some might view as a significant gap, especially if the girl is inexperienced. But since both are adults, it's a personal choice. The writer's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if they're using friends to keep them apart without the friend's consent.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the intervention is appropriate. The writer might be overstepping, hence answer A. But I need to make sure about legal and ethical boundaries here. Since it's legal, unless there's coercion, the writer's actions could be considered meddling. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
