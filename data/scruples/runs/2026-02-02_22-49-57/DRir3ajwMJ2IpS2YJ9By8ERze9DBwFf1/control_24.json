He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, the relationship would be legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but since the girl is now 18, it's within the legal bounds. So legally, there's no issue here. \n\nNext, the ethical perspective. The author is concerned about the age difference. While the girl is an adult, there's a significant age gap. However, the author is trying to prevent a relationship based on their own judgment. The key point here is whether the author has the right to interfere in their friend's personal choices. \n\nThe friend is an adult, so he has the autonomy to make his own decisions. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if the friend isn't being coerced. The girl also seems to show interest, so the author's intervention could be preventing a consensual relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. They mention their friend has been lonely and has had bad experiences with girls. The author might be acting out of concern, but that doesn't justify controlling behavior. The line between concern and overstepping can be blurry here.\n\nThe girl's perspective is important too. The author tried to warn her, but she didn't take it seriously. If she's of legal age and both parties consent, the author shouldn't have the authority to dictate her choices. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's friendship. Meddling in another's personal life can strain relationships. The friend might feel that his autonomy is being violated, which could lead to resentment.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be good, their actions involve interfering in a legal and consensual relationship. The friend and the girl are both adults, so the decision to pursue a relationship should be theirs. The author is in the wrong because they are imposing their views without justification beyond personal discomfort with the age difference.\n"
