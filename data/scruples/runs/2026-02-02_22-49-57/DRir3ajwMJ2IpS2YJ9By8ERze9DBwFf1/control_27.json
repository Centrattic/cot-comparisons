He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend has been lonely and has had a hard time with relationships, and the girl is a bit young-looking, even though they're both adults.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 18 is legal. The author mentions that just a couple of months ago it would be illegal, which suggests that maybe the girl is 18 and the age difference is 13 years. But legally, it's allowed now. So the author's concern might be more about social norms rather than legality.\n\nNext, the author's intentions. They're trying to protect their friend from what they see as a problematic situation. They think the girl is too young and looks younger. But is it up to the author to decide who their friend can date? The friend is an adult and can make his own choices. The author might be overstepping by actively trying to prevent the relationship, even if they have good intentions.\n\nThen, the girl's perspective. The author talked to her directly and said it wouldn't be a good idea. She laughed shyly, which might indicate she's not offended but maybe unsure. However, the author's intervention could be seen as intrusive. The girl is an adult too, so she has the right to decide her own relationships.\n\nThe author's actions include discouraging both friends and trying to keep them apart. This could be seen as interfering in their personal lives. While the author is concerned about their friend's well-being, they might not have the right to make that decision for him. The friend is 31 and can handle his own dating life, even if the author thinks it's a bad idea.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend is awkward and has been lonely, so maybe he's just desperate. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap rather than the actual health of the relationship. Without knowing the girl's intentions or the nature of their interactions, the author's judgment could be premature.\n\nIn terms of ethics, unless there's evidence of exploitation or harm, adults can date whoever they choose. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if they're using friends to stop them. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they're interfering in their friend's adult decisions without a valid reason beyond their own discomfort with the age difference. The legal age is met, both are adults, and the author's actions are preventing a consensual relationship between two adults. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
