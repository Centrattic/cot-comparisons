He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The main points here are the age difference, the legal aspects, and the author's intentions.\n\nFirst, both individuals are adults. In many places, 18 is the age of majority, so legally, there's no issue. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which probably refers to the fact that if the girl was under 18, it would be illegal. But now she's 18, so it's not. So, the legality is a non-issue here. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is concerned about the age gap. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. That's a 13-year difference. The author thinks the girl looks younger, maybe 16, which is a common concern. But since she's 18, even if she looks younger, legally and socially, it's a matter of personal choice. The author is trying to influence both the friend and the girl, but the girl seems to be interested, so the author's interference might not be justified.\n\nThe author's motivation is to protect their friend, thinking he should date someone closer to his age. But that's subjective. People can choose their partners regardless of age as long as both are adults. The author is overstepping by trying to prevent a possible relationship. Even if they're not in the relationship yet, the author has no authority to dictate the friend's romantic choices. \n\nAlso, the author approached the girl directly and told her it wouldn't be a good idea. That's meddling. The girl's response was to laugh shyly, which might indicate she's not interested in the author's opinion. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or paternalistic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern might come from a place of caring, the actions taken are not their place. The friend and the girl are both adults and have the right to decide their own relationships. The author is in the wrong for interfering.\n"
