He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author thinks the girl is too young, even though both are adults. They tried to stop them from getting together, talked to the girl directly, and are working with another friend to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The age of consent varies by country, but in most places, 18 is the age where someone is considered an adult and can legally consent to a relationship. So from a legal standpoint, there's no issue. But the author is uncomfortable because the girl looks younger, maybe like a 16-year-old. They mention that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might imply that the girl is just barely 18, so maybe there's a close age gap. However, as long as she's 18 or older, it's legal.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They're concerned because their friend has had bad luck with girls and is lonely, and they think the girl is too young. The author might feel protective of their friend, thinking he's being taken advantage of or that the girl isn't mature enough. But is it their place to interfere? The author isn't a parent or legal guardian, so they don't have authority over their friend's relationships. \n\nEthically, even if the author thinks the relationship isn't a good idea, both individuals are adults and can make their own choices. The author's actions involve trying to prevent the relationship without the consent of both parties. That could be seen as overstepping. The girl was told directly by the author that it wouldn't be a good idea, which might be intrusive. The friend is also being discouraged, which could damage trust if he feels his friends are controlling his life.\n\nHowever, the author might have genuine concerns about their friend's well-being. If the girl is manipulative or the relationship is unhealthy, the author's intervention could be justified. But based on the information given, there's no evidence that the girl is taking advantage or that the relationship is harmful. The author's judgment is based on personal discomfort with the age difference and the girl's appearance.\n\nAnother point: the author's actions include actively trying to keep them apart, which could be seen as interfering. It's possible that the author is projecting their own biases about age differences in relationships. Age gaps are common and can be healthy, as long as both parties consent. The fact that the author feels the need to intervene might stem from their own discomfort rather than any actual harm being done.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, there's no issue. Ethically, the author is overstepping by interfering in the relationship without a valid reason. The right to make personal choices about relationships belongs to the individuals involved. The author's actions might be driven by concern, but they're not the ones in the relationship and can't decide for others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
