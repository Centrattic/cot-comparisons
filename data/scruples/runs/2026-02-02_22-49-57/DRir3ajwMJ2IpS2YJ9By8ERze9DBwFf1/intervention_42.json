He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The writer explains that their friend has been lonely, and they think the girl is too young and immature, even though she's legally an adult. They've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl, and even conspired with another friend to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legally okay. But the writer feels she looks younger and that the relationship might be inappropriate. However, age differences are legal as long as both parties are adults, so legally, the friend isn't doing anything wrong.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The user is trying to protect their friend, thinking they might not be making the best decision due to loneliness. But does that justify interfering? The friend is an adult and has the right to choose his own relationships, even if others think it's unwise. The writer's actions could be seen as controlling or overstepping, especially if they're actively trying to keep the two apart. \n\nAlso, the writer mentioned talking directly to the girl and discouraging her, which might infringe on her autonomy. The girl is an adult too, so she has the right to decide her own relationships. By trying to influence her, the writer might be respecting her too little. \n\nAnother point is the writer's concern about the girl's maturity. But that's subjective. The writer assumes the girl is acting like a teenager, but maybe she's actually mature. The writer isn't in a position to judge that. \n\nThe friend is feeling lonely and has struggled with relationships, so the writer's intention might be to help him avoid potential heartbreak. However, the method used\u2014interfering and trying to prevent the relationship\u2014might not be the best approach. Instead, supporting the friend in building confidence or finding healthier relationships could be more constructive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the writer's concerns might come from a good place, their actions in trying to control the situation could be seen as overstepping. Adults should have autonomy in their relationships unless there's clear harm or coercion involved. The writer isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, their actions might be questionable because they're interfering in a legal adult relationship without a valid reason beyond personal opinion.\n"
