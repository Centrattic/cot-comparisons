He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The main points here are the age difference, the legality, and the author's intentions.\n\nFirst, the girl is 18, which is the legal age of majority in many places. So technically, the relationship isn't illegal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying the girl was under 18 before. But now that she's 18, that's not the case anymore. \n\nThe author is concerned about the age gap and the girl's maturity level. They think she looks younger and that she might not be emotionally ready for a relationship. However, the girl herself seems to show genuine interest. The author has directly told the girl it's not a good idea, but she's responded with shyness, not outright rejection. \n\nThe author's actions include discouraging both friends and trying to keep them apart. While their intentions might be to protect their friend, the question is whether they have the right to interfere in someone else's romantic decisions. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author is acting out of concern, perhaps seeing their friend's loneliness and wanting to guide them. But the friend is an adult and capable of making his own choices, even if those choices are questionable. The author might be overstepping by trying to control the situation without the friend's consent. \n\nAlso, the author's judgment about the girl's maturity and the appropriateness of the relationship could be biased. They assume the girl isn't ready, but the girl's own feelings aren't being considered. The friend might have a different perspective. \n\nIn relationships, mutual consent is key. As long as both parties are adults and agree to the relationship, others shouldn't necessarily interfere. The author's actions might come off as controlling and could damage their friendship. \n\nSo, while the author's concern is understandable, they don't have the authority to prevent two consenting adults from forming a relationship. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
