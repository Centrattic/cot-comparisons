He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, then it's legally okay because both are adults. The post mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that she's just turned 18 or close. But since she's 18 now, legally they can date. \n\nNext, the author's reasoning. They think the girl looks younger, maybe like a 16-year-old, which might make the author uncomfortable. But appearance doesn't determine legal age or consent. The girl is showing genuine interest, so it's not clear if it's just friendly. The author has tried to discourage both friends, even talking directly to the girl. \n\nEthically, the friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author is interfering without the friend's consent, possibly out of concern but overstepping. The girl is also an adult, so she can decide for herself. The author's actions, like trying to keep them apart, could be seen as controlling and not respecting the autonomy of both friends. \n\nAnother angle: the friend is lonely and has had trouble in the past. The author's intervention might be well-meaning, but it's not their place to dictate relationships. Unless there's evidence of harm or coercion, adults can choose partners. The author's actions might be based on their own discomfort rather than the actual best interest of their friend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal and consensual relationship, even if their intentions are good. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
