He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author's friend is 31, and they're worried about the age difference. Both are adults, but the author feels the girl looks younger and is concerned about the legality if it were a few months earlier. The author has directly told the girl it's not a good idea and is trying to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship itself isn't illegal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, which might refer to the girl being underage at the time. But now, she's 18, so legally, it's okay. The author's concern might be more about perception than legality.\n\nThen, there's the social aspect. Age gaps can be a sensitive topic. The author is a friend and is worried about their friend's well-being. They mention the friend has had bad luck with girls and is lonely. The author's intention is to help, but is it their place to interfere? Intervening in someone's personal relationships can be seen as overstepping, especially if both parties are adults and capable of making their own decisions.\n\nThe author tried to talk to both the friend and the girl. However, the girl showed no negative reaction, just laughed shyly. The author's actions might be based on their own discomfort rather than the girl's intentions. They might not have enough information about the girl's maturity or the nature of their interactions.\n\nAnother point is the author's motive. They might be projecting their own concerns or societal norms onto the situation. The friend's loneliness and the author's desire to see him happy could be clouding their judgment. But if the author believes it's harmful, they have a right to express that, even if they're not in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are to help their friend, the legality is on the side of the relationship, and both parties are adults. The author's actions in trying to prevent the relationship might interfere with their friend's autonomy. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
