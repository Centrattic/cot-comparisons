He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's okay for the author to try to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, depending on the jurisdiction. Since the girl is 18, and the friend is 31, technically there's no legal issue here. So the author can't use legality as a reason to stop them.\n\nNext, there's the age difference. An 18-year-old is just becoming an adult, while the guy is 31. There's a 13-year gap. That's a big difference. Some people might see this as a power imbalance because the older person could have more experience and influence over the younger one. But both are adults, so they can make their own choices, right?\n\nThe author is worried the girl is too young and looks even younger. They mention that the girl might be 16-looking, but she's actually 18. The author's concern is about her maturity level. However, unless the girl is underage, it's not the author's place to decide for her. The girl is showing genuine interest, so that's her choice to make.\n\nThe author tried to talk to the girl directly and said it's not a good idea. The girl just laughed and didn't take it seriously. Then the author is trying to prevent them from getting together by other means. That seems a bit overstepping. Even if the author is concerned, the two people involved are adults and can decide their own relationships. The author isn't a parent or authority figure here.\n\nAlso, the friend has been lonely and is finally showing interest in someone. The author is being a friend but maybe overstepping by trying to control who their friend dates. Unless there's a clear exploitation or harm, the author shouldn't interfere. Relationships are personal, and while the author might have good intentions, it's not their decision to make.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is trying to prevent a legal relationship between two adults. Even though they have concerns, it's not their role to interfere. The girl is an adult and can decide for herself. The author's actions might be well-meaning but are overstepping boundaries. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
