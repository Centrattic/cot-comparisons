He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31 and the girl is 18. Legally, in most places, both are adults, so the age of consent has been passed. The author is 31, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author is worried she's too young, comparing her to 16, which would be underage, but she's 18. The author and another friend are trying to stop them from getting together, even talking to the girl directly and trying to find ways to keep them apart.\n\nNow, the key points here are legal age, the author's intention, and the ethical aspect. Legally, the relationship isn't illegal, so the author can't prevent it on legal grounds. But the author is concerned about the age difference and the girl's maturity level. The author thinks she's acting like she's 16, which might be a red flag about her maturity. However, the girl shows genuine interest, and the friend is lonely. \n\nThe author's actions might be overstepping. They are trying to control their friend's relationships and even approached the girl directly. Even if their intentions are good, friends don't have the authority to dictate who others date, unless there's harm involved. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap rather than the girl's actual maturity. Also, the friend's loneliness and past issues with relationships are factors here. The author's intervention could be seen as meddling, even if they believe they're helping. \n\nHowever, there's an ethical consideration if the girl is indeed not mature enough, but the author can't determine that accurately. They assume she's acting like 16, but maybe they're wrong. It's possible the girl is mature for her age. The author's actions could be seen as violating their friend's autonomy. Unless there's evidence of exploitation or harm, it's not their place to interfere. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in their friend's personal decisions without a valid reason beyond their own discomfort with the age difference.\n"
