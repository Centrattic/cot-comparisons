He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop it.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In some places, if both are adults, it might be legal, but there are often close-in-age exemptions. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which makes me think that maybe the girl is exactly 18 and the state has a law where the age difference matters. For example, some states have a Romeo and Juliet law where if the younger person is close in age (like within a few years), it's allowed. But if the girl is 18 and the friend is 31, that's a 13-year age gap. Even if both are adults, some places might have specific laws about significant age differences. So maybe the author is right in thinking it's a problem legally.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is concerned about the age gap. An 18-year-old is still young, even if legally an adult. They might not have the same life experience, maturity, or be in a similar life stage as a 31-year-old. The author's friend is described as someone who hasn't had much luck with girls and is feeling lonely. The girl seems to be showing genuine interest, but the author is worried about the appropriateness of the relationship.\n\nThe author's actions include talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart. That raises the question: is it right for the author to interfere in someone else's romantic choices? The friend is an adult, so maybe the author shouldn't be making that decision for him. However, the author might believe they're protecting the friend from a potentially harmful situation.\n\nAnother point is the girl's maturity. The author notes that the girl looks like she's 16, which could indicate she's not as mature as her age suggests. If she's still in a developmental stage where she's not fully mature, a relationship with someone 13 years older could be imbalanced. Power dynamics in such a relationship might be an issue, even if both are adults.\n\nAlso, the author is trying to help out of concern for their friend, which is a common motive. But where is the line between helping and overstepping? The author's friend is an adult and might have the right to make his own decisions, even if others disagree. However, if the author believes the girl is taking advantage of his loneliness or inexperience, that's a different scenario.\n\nI should also consider cultural perspectives. In some cultures, older men dating younger women is more accepted, while in others, it's frowned upon. The author's discomfort might be influenced by their own cultural values.\n\nIn summary, the author is acting out of concern for their friend and possibly legal/ethical reasons. However, they're interfering in their friend's personal life. The key points are the legal status (if it's illegal or just a close call), the maturity of the girl, and whether the author has the right to intervene. If the relationship is legal, some might argue the author is overstepping. If it's close to illegal or there's a maturity issue, others might support the author's actions. So, the answer might depend on specific circumstances not fully detailed here, but based on the given info, the author's intentions are protective, but the method of intervention could be problematic.\n"
