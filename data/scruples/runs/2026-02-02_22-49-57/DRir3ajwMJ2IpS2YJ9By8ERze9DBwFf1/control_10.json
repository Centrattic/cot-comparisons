He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is feeling lonely and has been struggling with relationships, and the author thinks the girl is too young, even though both are adults. They've even tried to discourage the girl directly, but she laughed it off, and the friend is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of majority is 18, so the relationship is legally allowed. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might indicate that the girl is very young, maybe just turned 18. But legally, as long as she's 18 or older, it's fine. So there's no legal issue here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is concerned about the age gap. A 13-year difference might be seen as significant, but both are adults. The key here is whether the author has the right to interfere. The author is a friend, not a parent or legal guardian. Friends can give advice, but actively trying to prevent a consensual relationship between two adults might cross a line. The author is taking actions like directly telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep the friends apart. That seems overstepping. \n\nAlso, the author's motivations: their friend is feeling lonely and has had trouble with relationships. The author might be worried about their friend's well-being, but that doesn't justify manipulating the situation. The friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own decisions, even if they're different from what the author would choose. \n\nThe girl's perspective is also important. The author tried to warn her, but she laughed shyly, which might indicate she's not taking it seriously. But the author can't unilaterally decide who the girl can or cannot date. The girl is an adult and the relationship is her choice as well. \n\nSo, even though the author's intentions might be to protect their friend, the methods are inappropriate. The author is not in a position to control the friend's romantic choices. The correct answer here would be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a consensual adult relationship without justification.\n"
