He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author and another friend are discouraging them from getting together. \n\nFirst, I need to check the legal age of consent. In most U.S. states, 18 is the age of consent, so technically, a 31-year-old dating an 18-year-old is legal. However, there's a big age gap here\u201413 years. The author is concerned about the girl being too young and looking younger, even though she's 18. The author also mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying the girl is just barely 18.\n\nNow, the author's actions: they told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, and the girl laughed shyly. They're trying to keep the two apart. The key points here are consent, legality, and the author's right to interfere. Even though it's legal, some people might find a 13-year gap concerning, but that's subjective. The author's motivation is to protect their friend, maybe thinking he's being taken advantage of, but that's a big assumption.\n\nHowever, the girl is an adult, so it's her choice who she dates. The author has no legal right to prevent her from dating someone unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, which isn't mentioned here. The author is overstepping by directly trying to influence both parties. The fact that the girl seems interested and the guy is awkward but interested complicates things. The author's actions could be seen as meddling in adult decisions that don't affect them directly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be concerned about their friend's well-being, thinking he's being led on or that the relationship isn't healthy. But unless there's a clear risk, it's not their place to intervene. The answer would likely be A (author is wrong) because they're interfering in a legal, mutual adult relationship without justification. But maybe some might argue B, that it's their right to express concerns. However, the line is crossed when they actively try to prevent the relationship. So I think the answer is A.\n"
