He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a friend of a 31-year-old who's been struggling with relationships. He's trying to stop his friend from pursuing an 18-year-old girl. The friend is a bit awkward and maybe not experienced, and the girl might be genuinely interested, but the author thinks she's too young. The author and another friend have tried to interfere by talking to the girl and discouraging the friend.\n\nNow, the key points here are age difference, consent, and the role of the author. Legally, both are adults, so there's no issue there. However, the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger. But the girl's age is 18, which is legal. The author's actions include directly telling the girl it's not a good idea, which might be overstepping. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18, which is a 13-year difference. That's a significant gap, but again, legally okay.\n\nThe author's motivation is concern for their friend's well-being and maybe their own discomfort. But is it their place to meddle? Friends often give advice, but intervening in a potential relationship can be problematic. The girl's autonomy is important here\u2014she might not appreciate being told what to do. Also, the author's actions might be based on personal feelings rather than objective reasoning.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is acting in the friend's best interest. If the friend is lonely and this relationship could help, even if it's risky, maybe the author is being overly protective. But the author might believe the relationship is unsustainable or harmful. However, the friend is an adult and can make his own decisions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether interfering in another's romantic choices is justified. Since both parties are adults and the relationship isn't illegal, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're making decisions for both the friend and the girl. The author isn't in a position to dictate the girl's choices. So, the correct answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's a cultural or legal nuance I'm missing. However, based on the info given, the answer is likely A.\n"
