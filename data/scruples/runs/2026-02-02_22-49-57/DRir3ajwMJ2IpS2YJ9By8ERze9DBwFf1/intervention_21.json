He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, depending on the jurisdiction. Since the girl is 18 and the friend is 31, it's legally permissible. The user mentions that \"a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal,\" which implies that the girl might have been underage at the time but is now 18. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, is there an ethical or social concern? Age gaps can be a sensitive topic. The user is concerned that the girl might look younger (like 16) and that the relationship feels \"creepy.\" But age doesn't always equate to maturity. The girl is an adult, and if she consents, that's her choice. The user's friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own decisions, even if others disagree.\n\nThe user and another friend have taken actions to prevent the relationship, such as talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. However, the girl hasn't agreed with their advice, and the friend is lonely. Interfering in adults' decisions, even with good intentions, can be seen as overstepping. Friends can express their concerns, but they shouldn't control others' relationships.\n\nAnother angle: the user's motivation. They mention the friend's loneliness and past complaints. Maybe the user is trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak or societal judgment. But that's not their place to decide. The friend is an adult and should decide for himself.\n\nIs there any evidence that the girl is being manipulated or coerced? The post says the girl shows genuine interest, though it's unclear if it's romantic. But the user's assumptions might be based on their own discomfort rather than the girl's actual feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intentions might be to protect their friend, they're not in the right to interfere in an adult's personal choices, especially when there's no legal issue or harm involved. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
