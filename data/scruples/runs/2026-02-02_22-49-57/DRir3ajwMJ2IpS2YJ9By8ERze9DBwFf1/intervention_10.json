He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent is 18, so technically, the relationship would be legal. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger, maybe even underage. There's a difference between legal age and social norms. Some people might view a 31-18 age gap as a significant difference, even if both are adults.\n\nThe author is concerned about the power dynamic. A 31-year-old is more mature, which could create an imbalance. The girl is young and just becoming an adult, so there's a risk of her being more vulnerable. The author is trying to protect their friend from potential regret or the girl from being taken advantage of.\n\nHowever, the author's methods are questionable. Telling the girl outright that it's a bad idea might come off as interfering. Friends have a right to their own relationships unless there's actual harm involved. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl is interested and the friend is making his own choices.\n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. Are they acting out of genuine concern or their own discomfort? The post mentions the author finds the situation creepy. That could be a personal bias rather than a valid reason to interfere. Also, the author's friend has been lonely and is seeking attention, so the author might be projecting their own issues onto their friend's situation.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their opinion, but ethically, they might be. The decision to date is up to the two individuals involved. Unless there's clear harm or exploitation, friends shouldn't prevent others from forming relationships. The author's attempts to keep them apart could be seen as controlling or dismissive of their friend's autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, their actions in actively trying to prevent the relationship could be problematic. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if there are other angles. Maybe the author's concern is valid if the girl is genuinely underage, but the scenario states she's 18. So legally, they can date. The main issue is the author overstepping by interfering without a legitimate reason beyond their own discomfort.\n"
