He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, both people being 18 and 31 are adults, so the relationship isn't illegal. The author mentions that \"a couple of months ago it would be illegal,\" which suggests that maybe the girl was under 18 before, but now she's 18. So the legal barrier is gone.\n\nNext, the moral or ethical aspect. The author's main concern is that there's a big age gap. The friend has had trouble with relationships, and the author is worried about the girl being too young. But the girl is still an adult. The author might be projecting their own discomfort or societal views about age gaps onto the situation. The author directly told the girl it's not a good idea, which could be seen as interfering. The friend is the one trying to pursue her, so the author's actions might be overstepping. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to prevent a relationship between two consenting adults. Even if the author thinks the girl is acting younger, that's not their place to decide. The girl's interest isn't clear, but the author is making assumptions. The author's motivation might be to protect their friend, but they have no right to control his romantic choices once the relationship is legal.\n\nPotential issues here: consent, autonomy, and the right to personal relationships. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative or interfering in someone else's life without their consent. The friend is an adult and should make his own decisions, even if the author disapproves. The author's friends might be acting out of concern but are violating the friend's autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are interfering in a legal, consensual relationship between two adults, even if their intentions are to protect their friend.\n"
