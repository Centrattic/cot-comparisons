He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully. The friend is 31, and he's been having trouble with relationships. He's met an 18-year-old girl, and they're becoming friends, but he's interested in her. The writer is trying to stop him from pursuing a relationship. The main issue is the age difference.\n\nFirst, I should check the legal aspect. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so legally, it's allowed. The writer mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, maybe because the girl was underage then. But now she's 18, so it's legal. So the writer's concern isn't about legality.\n\nThe writer's reasons are that the girl seems too young, maybe looks 16, and that the age gap is significant. They've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl. The friend is lonely and has had bad luck, which makes the writer feel sympathy but also worry about the age difference.\n\nI need to consider if the writer has the right to intervene. Since both are adults, the writer isn't a parent or authority figure. The friend is an adult, so he can make his own decisions. The writer's actions might be overstepping by trying to prevent a potential relationship without a valid legal or ethical reason.\n\nAlso, the writer is making assumptions about the girl's intentions and the girl's maturity. Just because someone looks younger doesn't mean they can't consent or be in a relationship. The writer is projecting their own discomfort onto the situation.\n\nAnother angle: the writer is trying to protect their friend from possible regret, but that's not their decision to make. The friend's autonomy is important here. Unless there's a clear harm or manipulation, adults should be allowed to choose their partners.\n\nSo, based on this, the writer is overstepping by interfering in a legal and consensual situation between two adults. They're not in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be overstepping by controlling their friend's choices.\n"
