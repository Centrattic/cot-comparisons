He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend, who is 31, is interested in an 18-year-old girl. The author is trying to stop them from getting together, thinking the girl is too young, even though they're both legally adults. But the author feels uncomfortable because the girl looks younger, and maybe the age difference feels too big even if it's not illegal.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent is 16 in some states and 18 in others. But since the friend is 31 and the girl is 18, if the state's age of consent is 18, then it's legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now it's not. So the relationship is legal now. However, the author still thinks it's inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is about the age difference. Even though it's legal, some people might still feel that a 13-year age gap is too much. But the author is trying to prevent their friend from dating someone he's interested in. Is that their place? The author is the one who is uncomfortable and is acting on their own feelings rather than any legal or ethical violation. \n\nThe girl is 18, so if she's mature and consensual, then it's her choice. The author is not a parent or guardian, so they can't dictate the girl's decisions. The friend is an adult, so he can decide who he wants to date. The author's actions\u2014discouraging both the friend and the girl\u2014might be seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intentions are to protect them, it's not their responsibility. The author is interfering in a situation where both parties are adults and capable of making their own choices.\n\nHowever, there's a point about the girl's age looking younger. If the girl isn't mature enough for a 31-year-old, maybe the author is concerned about maturity. But the author can't assume that without knowing the girl's maturity level. The girl might be mature beyond her years. The author's judgment here is based on appearance, which isn't reliable.\n\nSo, the author is trying to prevent a legal and consensual relationship between two adults. Even if there's an age gap, unless there's a legal or non-consensual issue, the author isn't in the right to interfere. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they are overstepping their role as a friend, and the relationship is between two adults capable of making their own decisions.\n"
