He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. The girl is 18, so technically, it's legal for them to date. The author mentions that just a couple months ago it would be illegal, which implies that maybe the girl turned 18 recently. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The girl is still very young, and the author feels like she looks 16. There might be concerns about maturity levels. The author is worried the girl might not be emotionally mature enough for a relationship with someone a decade older. But since both are adults, it's their choice. The author's role is to be a friend, not to control their friend's decisions.\n\nThe author is directly interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. While the intention might be to protect their friend, it's important that the friend makes his own decisions. The author might be overstepping by not trusting their friend's judgment, even if the friend is acting awkwardly.\n\nAlso, the author's friend is lonely and has had relationship issues. The author is trying to help, but perhaps the right approach would be to support their friend in making his own decisions rather than intervening. The author isn't wrong to be concerned, but taking active steps to prevent a legal and consensual relationship could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in a legal, consensual relationship without the right to do so. Even if their intentions are good, the action itself could be crossing a boundary.\n"
