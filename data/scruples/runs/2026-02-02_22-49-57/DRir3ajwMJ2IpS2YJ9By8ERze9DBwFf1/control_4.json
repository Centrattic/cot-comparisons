He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The friend is 31, the girl is 18. Both are adults, but the writer thinks she looks younger, like 16, and that the age difference is too big. They're trying to stop their friend from pursuing a relationship, even going as far as to talk to the girl directly. The writer's reasoning is that it's illegal if she were younger, and they're worried about the age gap. The question is whether the writer is wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, legally, in most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, depending on the jurisdiction. Since the girl is 18, and the friend is 31, the relationship is legal. The writer is concerned she looks younger, but that's not the legal standard. The issue here is about the appropriateness of the age difference. Age gaps can be a sensitive topic. The writer's actions involve intervening in their friend's personal life, possibly based on their own judgment rather than the friend's desires.\n\nThe key points here are consent, legality, and autonomy. Since both are adults, the relationship is consensual and legal. The writer is acting as a gatekeeper, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the writer thinks the age gap is problematic, the friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. However, the writer's concern might stem from a place of trying to protect their friend, thinking they're acting in their best interest.\n\nBut is that the writer's place to decide? The friend is an adult, so unless there's evidence of coercion or manipulation, it's not the writer's responsibility to intervene. The writer's actions (talking to the girl directly, trying to prevent the relationship) may be intrusive. Even if the friend is awkward or hasn't had success before, that doesn't justify others making decisions for him. The writer might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap onto their friend.\n\nHowever, there's also a point about the girl's maturity. If she appears significantly younger, even though she's 18, there could be concerns about power dynamics or her readiness for a relationship with someone much older. But again, unless there's actual evidence of something wrong, it's not the writer's place to meddle. The writer's actions could be seen as interfering in their friend's life, which is not appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the writer is in the wrong) because they're interfering in an adult's personal life where there's no legal issue or clear harm. The friend is an adult, and the relationship is consensual. The writer's actions are overstepping by trying to control the friend's choices.\n"
