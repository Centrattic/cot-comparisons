He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is lonely and hasn't had success with women, and the girl seems to be his type but the author thinks she's too young. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop this relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, consent for marriage or dating is 18, so technically, the girl is an adult. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might refer to scenarios where the girl was under 18, but now she's 18, so it's legal. So legally, there's no issue.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is acting out of concern for their friend, possibly thinking the girl isn't mature enough. But the girl is a legal adult, and if she consents, the author has no legal right to prevent the relationship. The author is making assumptions about the girl's maturity and the nature of the interest, which might not be accurate. The girl might be interested in a romantic relationship, and the author is imposing their own judgment without knowing her perspective.\n\nAlso, the friend's loneliness is a factor. The author is interfering in the friend's personal choices, which could be seen as overstepping. The friend might appreciate the concern, but the author is taking actions without the friend's consent, like talking to the girl directly and actively trying to keep them apart. That's pretty intrusive.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own bias. They think the girl \"looks 16\" and find the age difference creepy. But age differences exist in many relationships, and the author's discomfort might be based on personal opinion rather than any factual harm. The key here is that both parties are adults and can make their own decisions, even if the author disagrees.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author is not in the legal wrong because the relationship is between two adults. Ethically, though, the author is interfering in their friend's personal life without justification, making assumptions about the girl's intentions, and imposing their own values. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
