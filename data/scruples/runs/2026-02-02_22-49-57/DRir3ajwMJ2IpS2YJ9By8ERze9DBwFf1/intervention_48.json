He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author is 31, so they're both adults. The user's friend is feeling lonely and has had trouble with relationships before. The author and another friend are trying to stop him from pursuing this relationship, even telling the girl it's a bad idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. Since the girl is 18, it's legal for her to date someone older. The age difference here is 13 years, which is a significant gap but within legal limits. So legally, there's no issue. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, implying that the girl was underage then, but now she's 18. That's a key point because it's legal now.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is worried about the power dynamic. The girl is just becoming an adult, while the friend is significantly older. This could lead to an imbalance where one person has more life experience, which might affect the relationship's equality. However, if both are adults and consent, the relationship is technically consensual. The author is acting out of concern, thinking they're protecting their friend from potential regrets or the girl from being taken advantage of. But is it their place to interfere?\n\nThen, the social norms. Age-gap relationships can be controversial, but they're not uncommon. Some people might see a 13-year gap as too big, others might not. The author's discomfort comes from seeing the girl as looking younger, which is subjective. The fact that the girl is showing genuine interest complicates things, but how much interest is there? The friend is awkward, so maybe the girl isn't being pressured into anything.\n\nAlso, the method of intervention matters. The author is actively trying to keep them apart, which could be seen as manipulation. Telling the girl directly it's a bad idea might influence her decision. If the girl is interested, the author's interference could be hindering her autonomy. The friend's loneliness is valid, but the author's actions might be projecting their own views on what's acceptable in a relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author is acting as a friend, trying to help. But is it their role to make decisions for their friend? The friend might have the right to pursue relationships as he sees fit, even if they're unconventional. The author's friends might have their own biases about age gaps. Maybe the issue isn't the age but the friend's past struggles with relationships. The author might be trying to protect their friend from failure without considering that the friend is ready for a new dynamic.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are to protect their friend and the girl, their actions could be seen as overstepping. The legality is on their side, but the ethics are murky. The key points are consent, autonomy, and the right to form relationships. The author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's debatable. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which often includes both legal and moral aspects, the answer might hinge on whether the author has the right to interfere in a consensual adult relationship. Given that, the author is likely not in the wrong, but there are valid arguments on both sides.\n"
