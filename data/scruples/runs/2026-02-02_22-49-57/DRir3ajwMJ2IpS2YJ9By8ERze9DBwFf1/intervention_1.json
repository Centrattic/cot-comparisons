He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author and their friend are actively trying to stop this, with the author even talking to the girl directly.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is a factor here. In most places, 18 is the age of majority, so it's legally okay. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger, like 16, and might be too young for the friend. The author's main concern seems to be based on the girl's perceived maturity and the significant age gap.\n\nThe question is about whether the author's actions are wrong. The key points to consider are: 1) Legal vs. moral concerns. Since it's legal, the author can't stop them legally, but they might have moral or ethical reasons. 2) The author's role in interfering with their friend's personal choices. Friends often give advice, but actively trying to prevent a relationship could be overstepping. 3) The girl's consent and autonomy. The girl is an adult, so she has the right to choose her partners, even if others think she's not mature enough. \n\nThe author's actions include directly talking to the girl and trying to keep the friend away. That might be seen as manipulative or controlling. The friend is an adult, so he has the right to make his own decisions about relationships, even if others disapprove. The author might be motivated by concern but is imposing their own judgment. \n\nHowever, the author could argue they're looking out for their friend's well-being. But the line here is whether it's their place to do so. It's possible the author is overstepping by not just advising but actively intervening. The girl is also an adult, so their relationship is a mutual choice, and the author has no authority to stop it. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, their actions interfere with the autonomy of both the friend and the girl. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
