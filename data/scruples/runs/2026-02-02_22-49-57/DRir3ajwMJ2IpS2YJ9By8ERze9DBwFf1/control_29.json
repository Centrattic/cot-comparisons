He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. The age of consent varies by location, but in many places, 18 is the age where it's legal. The author is worried about the age gap, thinking she looks younger, and that it's \"creepy.\" But legally, it's allowed. \n\nThe author has directly told the girl it's a bad idea, which could be seen as interfering in her personal choices. The girl seems interested in the friend, and the friend is lonely and hasn't had much luck with relationships. The author's actions might be coming from a place of concern, but they're overstepping by trying to prevent the relationship. \n\nThe key points here are consent and personal autonomy. Since both parties are adults, they have the right to choose their partners. The author isn't a legal guardian or responsible for their decisions. While the age gap might be uncomfortable for some, it's not the author's place to dictate romantic choices unless there's harm involved. \n\nSo, the author is likely overstepping their bounds here. They should focus on supporting their friend and letting him make his own decisions, even if they disagree. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in the autonomy of both individuals involved.\n"
