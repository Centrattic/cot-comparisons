He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend is lonely and hasn't had much success with relationships before, and the girl is just turning 18. The author feels that even though both are adults now, the girl looks much younger and the age gap is too big. They've been actively trying to discourage both the friend and the girl from pursuing a relationship.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider age of consent laws. Since the girl is 18, it's legal for them to date. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that the legal age difference is now okay. So legally, there's no issue here. But the author is concerned about the perceived age and the social acceptability.\n\nNext, the author is acting out of concern for their friend's well-being. They might think the relationship could be inappropriate or exploitative given the age gap. But is it their place to intervene? Friends often give advice, but where's the line between concern and overstepping?\n\nThe girl is 18, which is the legal age of majority in many places. Even if she looks younger, she's an adult. The author's actions could be seen as interfering with her autonomy. The girl might not appreciate being told it's a bad idea, especially if she's interested in the friend. The author's approach includes discouraging both parties, which could be manipulative if done without their consent.\n\nAlso, the author's motives: they might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap or the friend's loneliness. The friend is making his own choices, and while the author is trying to help, they're not the ones making the decisions here. The key question is whether the author has the right to prevent their friend from pursuing a legal and consensual relationship with another adult.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their friend from potential regret. On the other hand, relationships are personal, and intervening without being asked could be seen as overstepping. The author might be in the wrong if their actions are based on personal discomfort rather than the friend's actual best interest.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal, consensual adult relationship without being asked to intervene, and their actions may infringe on the autonomy of both their friend and the girl.\n"
