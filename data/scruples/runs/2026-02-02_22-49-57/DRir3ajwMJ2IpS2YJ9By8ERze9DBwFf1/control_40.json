He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18, which is legal in most places, but the author feels uncomfortable because the girl looks younger and they think she's too young. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 18 is definitely legal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would've been illegal, which might refer to a situation where the girl was a minor before turning 18. But now she's an adult.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is intervening, even though both parties are adults. The girl shows genuine interest, and the friend is lonely. The author's reasons seem to be based on appearance (thinking she looks 16) and personal discomfort. But since age is legal, the author's interference could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to the girl and finding ways to keep them apart. That could be seen as meddling, especially if the friend isn't interested in hearing their advice. The friend has a right to make their own romantic choices, even if the author disagrees. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a concern about the girl's maturity. If the girl is still in high school or very young in demeanor, the author might think the relationship is exploitative. But since the girl is 18, unless there's evidence of coercion or manipulation, it's not the author's place to decide. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect their friend, the action of intervening in a legal, consensual relationship could be considered wrong because it infringes on the friend's autonomy. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering without a valid reason beyond personal discomfort.\n"
