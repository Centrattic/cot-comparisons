He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent. In many places, 18 is the legal age, so it's technically allowed. But the author feels it's too young because the girl looks younger. The author's concern is about the age gap and maybe the girl's maturity level. But the girl is an adult, so the decision to date should be her own.\n\nThen, the author is actively trying to prevent the relationship. They've spoken to the girl directly, telling her it's not a good idea. She laughed shyly, which might mean she's not taking it seriously. The author is also trying to keep them apart. \n\nI need to consider if the author has the right to interfere in their friend's romantic choices. Even if the author is worried about their friend's well-being, the friend is an adult and should make his own decisions. The author might be overstepping by manipulating the situation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships. The author's motives could be genuine concern, but the method of interference, especially without the friend's consent, might be problematic. It's possible the author is projecting their own fears or discomfort with the age difference onto their friend.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. While the author's intentions are to protect their friend, they might not have the right to make that decision for him. The girl is also an adult, so her choice to date him isn't the author's responsibility to control. The key points are consent, legal age, and the right to personal relationships. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions cross into manipulative or controlling behavior. If the author is just expressing concern, that's one thing, but actively trying to keep them apart could be overreaching. Hence, the author might be in the wrong because they're interfering in a legally and consensually adult relationship without justification beyond personal discomfort.\n"
