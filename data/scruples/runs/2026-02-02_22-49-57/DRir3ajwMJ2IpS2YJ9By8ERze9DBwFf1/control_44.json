He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 31-year-old friend wanting to get close to an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship isn't illegal. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger. However, age of consent is about legality, not maturity. The author might be projecting their own discomfort.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is actively trying to prevent the relationship, even talking to the girl directly. That could be seen as interfering in another person's autonomy. The friend is an adult, so he has the right to choose his relationships, even if others disapprove. \n\nThe writer might be acting out of concern, but where's the line between concern and overstepping? If the girl is consenting and of age, the author's actions could be seen as controlling. Also, the author mentions the girl might be \"way too young,\" but 18 is legally an adult. The fact that she looks younger doesn't change her legal status. \n\nAre there other factors? The friend has had bad luck with relationships, and the author might be trying to help. But does that justify manipulation or interference? It's possible the author is overstepping by not respecting the autonomy of both parties involved.\n\nIn many cases, even if someone feels a relationship is a bad idea, they shouldn't force their opinions on others unless there's actual harm. Since both parties are adults, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they're interfering without a valid reason beyond personal discomfort.\n"
