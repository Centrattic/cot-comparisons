I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author's 31-year-old friend is trying to get close to an 18-year-old girl. They're friends, but the guy wants a romantic relationship. The author is concerned she's too young and mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal because 18 is the age of consent in some places. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them from dating, even talking to the girl directly about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. The girl is 18, which is the age of majority in many countries. So, technically, it's legal for them to date. The author says that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying maybe the girl was under 18 before. But now she's 18, so that's not an issue anymore. So the legal argument against their relationship is gone. \n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is worried about the age gap. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old are 13 years apart. That's a significant difference. Some might argue that such a gap could mean power imbalances or inexperience on the part of the younger person. But the girl is an adult now, and if both are consenting, that's a key point. The author is trying to prevent their friend from pursuing a relationship, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe author mentions that the guy is awkward and maybe not the best at reading signals. The girl shows \"genuine interest\" but the author isn't sure if it's friendly or romantic. However, the author took it upon themselves to talk to the girl directly and discourage her. That seems a bit overstepping. It's one thing to advise your friend, but to go to the girl and tell her it wouldn't be a good idea could be seen as interfering. \n\nAlso, the guy has been feeling lonely and has had trouble with girls in the past. The author might be acting out of concern for their friend's well-being. But is it their place to decide who their friend can date? While the intention is good, the method of intervention could be problematic. The author and their friend are trying to \"keep him away from her,\" which suggests maybe manipulating the situation. That's not healthy. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the girl's autonomy. Even if the author doesn't approve of the relationship, the girl is an adult and should have the right to make her own decisions. The author's actions might come across as controlling or judgmental. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some places, a 13-year age gap is more accepted, but in others, it might be frowned upon. However, in the context of the question, the legality is already satisfied, so the main issue is social and ethical. \n\nThe key points here are: both parties are adults, the author is interfering in their friend's romantic choices, and the author is directly discouraging the girl. Even if the author has good intentions, the approach might be wrong. The friend is an adult and should have the right to choose his partner, even if others disagree. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not necessarily in the wrong in terms of legal boundaries, but ethically, they might be overstepping by interfering in their friend's personal life and relationships. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are imposing their views on others' adult relationships, which is generally not acceptable.\n"
