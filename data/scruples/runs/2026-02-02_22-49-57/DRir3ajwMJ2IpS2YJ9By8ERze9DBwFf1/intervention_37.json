He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author's reasoning is that they feel the age gap is too big, even though both are adults. \n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so legally, there's no issue. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but since the girl is now 18, that's not the case anymore. So legally, the author can't use that as a valid point.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is concerned about the age gap, thinking the girl looks younger. But age gaps in relationships between adults are common and not inherently problematic. The key here is whether both parties consent and are comfortable. The post says the girl shows genuine interest, though it's unclear if it's romantic or just friendly. The author's judgment based on appearance is a problem because it's not the girl's actual age that matters, but her legal age and her consent.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014trying to prevent the relationship through persuasion and other means\u2014could be seen as overstepping. Friends can certainly express their concerns, but actively interfering in someone else's personal life without their consent might not be appropriate. The friend is an adult and has the right to make his own decisions, even if others disagree.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be influenced by their own biases. The friend is described as awkward and having had bad luck with women, so the author might be projecting their own preferences onto the situation. Everyone's right to choose their partners, regardless of age, as long as it's consensual.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are based on personal disapproval rather than any legitimate concern. They're not in a position to decide for their friend who he can date. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
