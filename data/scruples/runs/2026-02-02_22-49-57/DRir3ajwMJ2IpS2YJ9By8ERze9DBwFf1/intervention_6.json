He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a friend of someone who's 31 and has had trouble with relationships. This friend is now interested in an 18-year-old girl. The author feels the girl is too young, even though she's legally an adult. The author and another friend are trying to prevent them from dating. The author even told the girl it's not a good idea, and she laughed shyly. The friend is feeling lonely and the author is trying to steer him away.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are the age difference, consent, and the role of the author as a friend.\n\nAge of consent is legal, but societal norms and perceptions matter. Even if it's legally allowed, some people might think there's a significant age gap. The girl is 18, which is the legal age, so there's no legal issue. But the author thinks she looks 16, which is below the age of consent. That might be a reason for concern, but since she's 18, it's still legal.\n\nIs the author overstepping by trying to prevent the relationship? The friends are adults, so they can make their own decisions. However, the author is worried about the friend's loneliness and past failures in relationships. The author might be acting out of concern, but does that give them the right to interfere?\n\nAlso, the girl's reaction was to laugh shyly, which might indicate she's not taken seriously. The author's approach might be paternalistic. In some cases, people might feel it's their role to protect a friend from potentially harmful situations, but where's the line?\n\nAnother angle: the author and the friend are trying to find other ways to keep them apart. That could be seen as manipulative. If the relationship is consensual, maybe the author shouldn't interfere. But if there's a power imbalance because of the age difference, maybe the author is justified.\n\nBut the girl is 18, which is the legal age. The author's concern is based on appearance, not actual age. So, the legal age is met, but the perceived age is lower. However, since the girl is 18, the author's concern might be misplaced. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or coercion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be well-intentioned, but are they in the wrong? Interfering in another person's romantic decisions, even if you're a friend, could be seen as crossing a boundary. Unless there's a clear harm, like the girl being underage, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for trying to control the friend's choices.\n"
