He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The core issue is about age difference and consent.\n\nFirst, both individuals are adults. Legally, in many places, 18 is the age of consent. So there's no legal issue here. The author mentions that the girl might look younger, but age appearance is subjective. The fact that she's 18, even if she looks younger, means it's legal. The author's discomfort is more about personal feelings than legal boundaries.\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to the girl directly and trying to keep the two apart. That's where the ethical part comes in. Friends can express their concerns, but actively trying to prevent a relationship might overstep. The girl seems to be showing interest, and the author's actions could be seen as manipulative, especially if they're pressuring her or the friend without considering their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the friend's loneliness is a factor. The author is motivated by concern, but the solution\u2014stopping him from pursuing the relationship\u2014might not be the best approach. It's possible the friend needs help with social skills or confidence rather than being restricted from someone who is legally an adult.\n\nSo, the author's intentions might be good, but their methods cross into controlling behavior. The ethical stance here is about respecting people's choices as adults. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
