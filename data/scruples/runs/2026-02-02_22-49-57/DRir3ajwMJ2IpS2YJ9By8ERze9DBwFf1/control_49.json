He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. The author's main concern is that the girl looks younger, maybe like a 16-year-old, and that the age difference feels too big.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship wouldn't be illegal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that the girl was under 18 before, which might be a valid concern if there was a past situation where she was underage. But now she's 18, so that's not an issue anymore.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is acting out of concern for their friend, thinking he might be making a mistake. But the friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The author's friend is also struggling with relationships, so maybe this is his chance to connect with someone. The author is intervening by talking to the girl and trying to keep the two apart. That could be seen as overstepping, especially since the girl is an adult too.\n\nThe author's justification is that the age difference is too big, but age gaps between adults are a personal choice. What's \"too young\" is subjective. The author might be projecting their own discomfort or societal norms onto the situation. Also, the friend is clearly interested, and the girl shows some interest back. The author's actions could be hindering the friend's autonomy and happiness.\n\nHowever, the author might have good intentions, wanting to protect their friend from potential regret or heartbreak. But unless there's clear evidence of manipulation or harm, it's not their place to intervene. The girl is an adult, so she can make her own decisions too. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if they're actively trying to prevent the relationship without the friend's consent.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concern is understandable, they are not in the right because they're interfering with an adult's personal decisions without valid legal or ethical grounds. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
