He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author thinks she's too young, even though both are adults. They've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 18, the girl is legally an adult, so there's no legal issue here. Legally, the relationship is allowed. But the author is concerned about the age difference and the girl's maturity level. They mention that she looks younger, maybe 16, which might indicate a maturity gap. However, that's subjective\u2014just because someone looks younger doesn't mean they aren't mature enough.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is friends with the 31-year-old and is worried about their friend's loneliness and past bad experiences. They want to help, but their methods involve discouraging both parties. Is it right for them to interfere in another person's romantic decisions? Even if the author's intentions are good, are they overstepping?\n\nAnother angle is consent. Both parties are adults, so they can make their own choices. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or assuming they know what's best for their friend and the girl. The girl seems to have shown some interest, even if it's unclear if it's romantic. By telling her it wouldn't be a good idea, the author is imposing their own opinion, which might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the author's own bias about age differences might play a role. They're pushing for the girl to be at least 24. That's a personal preference, not an objective standard. While age can affect relationships, it's not a rule. The key factors here are mutual consent and both parties being adults.\n\nThe author's actions of trying to keep them apart could harm their friendship with the 31-year-old. The friend might feel betrayed if his friends are trying to sabotage his love life. The girl might also feel targeted if the author confronts her directly.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author isn't breaking any laws, but are they ethically in the wrong? Friends can give advice, but actively trying to prevent a relationship without being asked to might be overstepping. The author should probably talk to their friend about his feelings and maybe suggest considering the maturity level, but not take it upon themselves to stop the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intentions are good, but their actions might be crossing a line. They have a right to their opinion, but others have the right to make their own choices. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
