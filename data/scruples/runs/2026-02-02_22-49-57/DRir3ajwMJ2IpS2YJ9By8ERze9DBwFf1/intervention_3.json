He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend is 31 and wants to get with an 18-year-old girl. The author and another friend are trying to stop them.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent varies by place, but in many places, 18 is the age where it's legal. So the author is concerned about the age difference, but legally, it's allowed. However, the author feels the girl looks younger and is worried about the power dynamic. The friend is older and more experienced, which could be a problem if the girl is still in a developmental stage where she's not as mature.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if it's legal, there might be an age gap that could lead to issues like exploitation or the girl not being emotionally ready. The author's intentions are to protect their friend and the girl, but is that their place to decide?\n\nBut wait, the author isn't the parent or legal guardian. They're just a friend. Maybe the friend has the right to make his own decisions, even if they seem unwise. The author is interfering in a personal relationship, which can be seen as overstepping. The question is whether their actions are justified.\n\nThe girl is 18, so she's an adult. The author is trying to prevent a relationship that both parties are technically adults. The author might be acting out of concern, but others might see it as controlling. Also, the friend is feeling lonely and has had bad experiences, so pushing him away from a potential connection could be harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries. The answer might be yes, they're in the wrong because they're interfering in a relationship between two adults. But others might argue that the age difference still poses risks. Hmm.\n"
