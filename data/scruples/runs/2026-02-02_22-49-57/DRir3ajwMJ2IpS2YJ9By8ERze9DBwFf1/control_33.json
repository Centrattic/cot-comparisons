He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a 31-year-old friend wants to pursue a relationship with an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop it. The friend is described as someone who hasn't had luck with girls and is feeling lonely, while the girl is technically an adult but looks younger. The author and another friend have tried to discourage both the friend and the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, as both are adults, it's legal. However, there might be societal or ethical considerations. The author is concerned about the age gap, thinking the girl might look younger than 18. But since she's 18, legally, it's okay. The author's main issue is that the girl is \"way too young\" for the 31-year-old, even though both are adults.\n\nNext, the author's actions: they told the girl directly it wouldn't be a good idea, and tried to discourage the friend. The girl laughed shyly, and the friend is lonely and not taking the advice. The author is trying to prevent them from getting together, maybe through other means.\n\nEthically, even if it's legal, there's a concern about power dynamics. An 18-year-old is at the start of adulthood, and a 31-year-old is more mature. The author might think the girl isn't ready for a serious relationship with someone significantly older. But the girl is showing genuine interest, so maybe it's mutual. However, the author's role as a friend is to be concerned about their friend's well-being and the girl's. But is it right to interfere in their personal choice?\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author acting as a moral guardian. Friends can suggest and advise, but can they prevent two consenting adults from forming a relationship? The line between helping a friend and overstepping might be crossed here. If the author is using manipulative tactics to keep them apart, that's problematic. The author might not be in the wrong if they're genuinely concerned, but if they're controlling or interfering without consent, that's another issue.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend is lonely and has had bad experiences. The author might be projecting their own feelings or fears onto the situation. Also, the author's judgment about the girl's appearance and perceived maturity is subjective. The girl is 18, so she's an adult, and the author's assumption that she's \"like 16\" could be incorrect. The author shouldn't make decisions for others based on their own perceptions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has good intentions, they might be overstepping by trying to prevent a legal and consensual relationship between two adults. Unless there's proof of coercion or harm, the author is in the wrong for interfering in their friends' personal choices.\n"
