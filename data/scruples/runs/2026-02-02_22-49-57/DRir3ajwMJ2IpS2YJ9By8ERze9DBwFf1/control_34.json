He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so legally, if both are adults, it's permissible. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger and the age gap feels significant. The author and a friend have tried to discourage the relationship, even talking directly to the girl and trying to keep them apart.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is concerned about their friend's well-being, maybe thinking the girl is too young or not mature enough. But on the other hand, the author is interfering in their friend's personal life without the friend's consent. Relationships are personal, and unless there's actual harm, friends shouldn't control others' choices. The author might be overstepping by actively trying to prevent the relationship, especially if the girl is of legal age. Even if the author's intentions are good, they don't have the right to make decisions for others. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering without cause.\n"
