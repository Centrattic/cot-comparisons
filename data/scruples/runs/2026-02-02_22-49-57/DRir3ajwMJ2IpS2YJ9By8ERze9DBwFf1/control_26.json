He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. So first, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally in many places, that's allowed. But the author feels it's inappropriate because she looks younger, maybe like a 16-year-old, and they're concerned about the age gap. They tried to prevent the relationship by talking to both parties.\n\nNow, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The first thing to check is the legality. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if it's 18, then technically it's legal. But if the girl is just over 18, maybe the author is worried about her maturity level. However, the author's role here is as a friend. Should they have the right to interfere?\n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. They mention that the friend has had bad luck with relationships and is lonely. The author is trying to protect their friend, maybe out of concern for his well-being. But does that give them the right to meddle? Also, the girl seems to show some interest, though it's unclear if it's romantic. The author told her it's a bad idea, but she just laughed. That might indicate she's not taking it seriously.\n\nEthically, even if it's legal, there's a question about power dynamics. An older person dating someone significantly younger can sometimes be seen as an imbalance, especially if one is still in their late teens. However, the author is stepping into a role of making decisions for their friend, which might not be their place. The friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own choices, even if others disagree.\n\nAlso, the author is using another friend to keep them apart. This could be seen as meddling in the friend's personal life without his consent. The line between being a concerned friend and infringing on someone's autonomy is important here. The author's actions might be well-intentioned, but they could be overstepping by not respecting their friend's decisions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014legality, autonomy, ethical concerns\u2014it seems the author is overstepping their role. The friend is an adult and has the right to choose his partners. The author's actions, while motivated by concern, might be in the wrong because they're interfering with his personal choices without his consent.\n"
