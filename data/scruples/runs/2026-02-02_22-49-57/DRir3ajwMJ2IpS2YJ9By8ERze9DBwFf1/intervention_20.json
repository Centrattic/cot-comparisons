He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Legally, in most places, the age of consent is 18, so as long as the relationship is consensual and not involving any form of coercion, it's technically legal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, which probably refers to the girl being under 18 at that time. Now that she's 18, it's legal.\n\nThe author is concerned about the age gap, even though both are adults. They said the girl looks younger, maybe like 16, which might make them feel uncomfortable. The author tried to discourage both the friend and the girl, even telling the girl it's not a good idea. The friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships, so he's drawn to this girl.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, friends often give advice, especially if they're concerned. The author's intention is to protect their friend from what they see as a potentially problematic situation. However, the friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. Even if the author and others think the relationship might not be ideal, it's not their place to prevent two consenting adults from dating unless there's actual harm or illegal activity.\n\nThe author's actions include trying to keep them apart and directly telling the girl it's a bad idea. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl is also an adult. The author's concern is valid in terms of their perception of the girl's maturity, but that's subjective. The legal age is 18, so unless there's a legal issue, the decision should rest with the individuals involved.\n\nSo, even though the author's intentions are good, they might be interfering in a way that's not their responsibility. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their concern is based on the age difference, but they could also be overstepping by trying to control the situation. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key point is that the people involved are adults. The author's actions might not be wrong in intention, but they might be wrong in execution because they're trying to prevent a consensual adult relationship.\n"
