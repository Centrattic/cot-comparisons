He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is key here. In most places, 18 is the age of majority, so technically, it's legal. But the author feels it's too young because the girl looks younger. However, age appearance shouldn't override the legal age. The author's discomfort might stem from the girl's maturity level, not her actual age.\n\nThen there's the issue of consent and autonomy. The question is, do the author and their friend have the right to interfere? The friend is an adult, so he can make his own decisions unless there's some form of coercion or harm involved. The author's actions, like talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart, could be seen as overstepping. They're adults, so their choices aren't the author's to control.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend is lonely and the girl shows interest. Even if the relationship might not work out, the friend should decide. The author's reasons are personal discomfort, not legal or ethical violations. So, interfering without a valid reason might be inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle: the author's role as a friend. While concerned, they might not have the authority to prevent their friend's relationships. The friend might need support rather than obstruction. The author's actions could harm the friendship if the friend feels betrayed.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is overstepping by trying to control their friend's choices based on personal judgment, not legal or ethical grounds. So, answer A (they are in the wrong).\n"
