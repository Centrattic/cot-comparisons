He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is feeling lonely and has a crush on the girl, who's technically an adult, but the writer thinks she looks younger and is concerned about the age gap.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. The writer mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that maybe the girl is still close to the lower age limit. But since she's 18 now, legally there's no issue.\n\nNext, the writer is acting out of concern for their friend. They think the girl might look younger and that the age gap is too big. However, the girl is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The writer is intervening by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart, which could be seen as overstepping. The girl was told directly it wouldn't be a good idea, but she responded shyly, which might indicate she's aware but not necessarily against the idea.\n\nThe writer's actions might stem from a place of wanting their friend to have a better chance with someone his own age, but they're making decisions for both their friend and the girl. The girl's autonomy is important here. Even if the writer thinks they know what's best, it's not their place to dictate the girl's choices. The friend is an adult too, so he should have the right to pursue a relationship if he's interested, even if the writer disagrees.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the writer's own discomfort. They mention the whole thought creeps them out, which might be personal bias. It's possible the writer has concerns about the girl's maturity level, but that's an assumption. The girl is 18, and people mature at different rates. The writer's judgment might not be valid.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer is trying to influence both parties without considering their autonomy. While their intentions might be good, they're interfering in a way that could be seen as controlling. The correct approach might be to express concerns to their friend and let him make his own decision, rather than actively trying to prevent the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're overstepping by trying to control the decisions of two adults who are legally allowed to date. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
