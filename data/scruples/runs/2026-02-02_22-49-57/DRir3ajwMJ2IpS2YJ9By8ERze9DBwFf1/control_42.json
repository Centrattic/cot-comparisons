He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legal. The user mentions that \"a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal,\" which suggests that the girl is just over the age of consent now. So legally, there's no problem here.\n\nBut then there's the social or ethical angle. The author thinks she's \"WAY too young\" and compares her to 16, which is under the age of consent. The author is worried about the age difference, even though both are adults. The friend is 31, the girl is 18, so a 13-year gap. That's a significant difference, but not illegal. \n\nThe author's motivations are concern for their friend's well-being. They think the friend is lonely and might not realize the girl isn't interested in a relationship. But the friend is an adult making his own choices. The author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. \n\nIs it the author's place to do that? Well, friends often give advice, but crossing into actively preventing someone from pursuing a relationship might be overstepping. The girl is an adult too, so she can make her own decisions. The author assumes she's just being friendly, but the girl showed some interest. Even if the author is worried about the age gap, it's not their decision to make. \n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as controlling. They talked to the girl directly and are trying to find other ways to keep them apart. That might not be respecting either person's autonomy. The friend might appreciate the concern, but ultimately, he's an adult to decide who he dates. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, maybe. But the question is if they're in the wrong. Since both are adults, and the author is interfering in their friend's personal choices, it's possible the author is overstepping. However, the answer might depend on cultural or personal views on age gaps. But in most cases, adults can date whoever they want as long as it's legal. So the author might be in the wrong for trying to control their friend's relationships.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong because both individuals are legally adults, and the age difference, while significant, doesn't inherently invalidate their relationship. The author overstepped by directly interfering in their friend's personal choices and autonomy. Friends can express concerns, but actively preventing adults from pursuing consensual relationships is ethically problematic.",
