He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. So, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author and another friend are trying to stop them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, then it's legal for them to date. The author mentions that just a couple of months ago it would have been illegal, implying that maybe the girl was underage before. But now she's 18, so their relationship is legal. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the author thinks she looks too young, maybe like 16. But appearance can be misleading. The girl's age is 18, which is an adult. The author's judgment based on looks might not be valid. The question is about consent and maturity. Even if she looks younger, if she's 18, she can legally consent. The author might be projecting their own discomfort here.\n\nThen there's the aspect of friendship and overstepping boundaries. The author is trying to prevent their friend from pursuing a relationship. The friend is an adult, so he has the right to choose his partners. The author's actions, like talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart, might be interfering with his autonomy. Even if the author's intentions are to protect their friend, they aren't the ones making the decisions for him.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girl showed genuine interest, though it's unclear if it's romantic. The fact that she laughed shyly when told it wouldn't be a good idea suggests she might not take the advice seriously. The author's approach might be dismissive of the girl's agency and her own feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own discomfort. They find the situation creepy. But personal discomfort doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, especially if all legal and ethical lines are respected. The author should consider whether their feelings are based on the situation or their own biases.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author is trying to help their lonely friend, which is understandable. But the method of intervention might be inappropriate. It's one thing to give honest feedback and another to actively sabotage a relationship. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be overstepping by interfering in their friend's personal choices. Since both individuals are of legal age and capable of consent, the author's actions could be seen as violating their friend's autonomy. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are interfering in a relationship that is legal and the friend is an adult who can make his own decisions, regardless of the author's discomfort.\n"
