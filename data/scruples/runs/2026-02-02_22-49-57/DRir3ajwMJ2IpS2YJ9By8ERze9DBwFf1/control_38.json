He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In most places, 18 is the age of consent. So even though the girl looks younger, legally it's okay. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, which implies that the girl is now 18. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nThen there's the age difference. The friend is 31, the girl is 18. That's a 13-year gap. Some people might find that a problem, but both are adults. The author's concern is that the girl \"might as well be 16,\" but age isn't the only factor. The girl's maturity level and intentions matter. The author isn't providing evidence that the girl isn't mature or that there's coercion. Just their own discomfort.\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to both the friend and the girl. They told the girl it's not a good idea, which could be seen as meddling. The friend is lonely and trying to find someone, and the author is blocking his attempts. Even if the author's intentions are good, they're not the ones involved in the relationship. It's the friend's choice unless there's exploitation or harm.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be coming from their own judgment. They might think the friend is settling or that the girl isn't right for him. But unless there's concrete reasons, it's not their place to intervene. The girl has shown some interest, and while it's unclear if it's romantic, that's up to them to figure out.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is overstepping by trying to control their friend's relationships without valid reasons. They're acting on personal discomfort rather than actual harm. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong, but wait, maybe not. Wait, the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not). If the author is interfering without valid cause, then they are in the wrong. So A would be correct. But I need to be careful here. In some contexts, friends might try to protect each other, but if there's no legal or ethical issue, then it's not their place. So the answer is A.\n"
