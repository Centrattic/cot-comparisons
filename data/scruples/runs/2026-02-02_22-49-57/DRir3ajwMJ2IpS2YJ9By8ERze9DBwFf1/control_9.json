He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with relationships, and the girl is just a bit over 18. The author thinks she looks too young, maybe like 16, and is worried about the age difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so even if the girl looks younger, it's technically legal for them to date. But the author is concerned about the perception and maybe the girl's maturity level. The girl is in her first year of adulthood, so there's a significant age gap\u201413 years. That could be a problem in terms of life stages and maturity. The author might be worried about the girl being taken advantage of or the relationship being imbalanced.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical angle. The author is intervening on behalf of their friend, which could be seen as overstepping. The friend is an adult and should have autonomy over their own relationships. By trying to prevent the relationship, the author might be denying their friend's right to choose, even if the author thinks it's a bad choice. On the other hand, if the author truly believes the girl is being manipulated or that the relationship is harmful, they might be justified in stepping in. But how can the author be sure? They admit they can't tell if the girl's interest is just friendly or romantic.\n\nAnother point is the author's own judgment. They mention the girl looks 16, but appearance isn't the same as actual age. It's possible the author is underestimating the girl's maturity or overestimating the age difference's impact. Also, the author's actions\u2014talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014might be seen as interfering in a way that's not their place. Friends can give advice, but actively trying to sabotage a relationship without the person's consent is problematic.\n\nThe friend's loneliness and the author's role in supporting them could be a factor. The author might be trying to help by steering their friend towards more \"appropriate\" relationships, but that's not necessarily their decision to make. The author's justification hinges on the idea that the age difference is a problem, but if both parties are consenting adults, that's their choice to make. Unless there's evidence of exploitation or harm, the author's interference might be unwarranted.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect their friend and the younger person, they are overstepping by making decisions for adults who are capable of making their own choices. The relationship's legality and the adults' autonomy are key factors here. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for interfering without a clear case of harm.\n"
