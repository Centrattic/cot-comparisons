He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend has had trouble with relationships and is now interested in this younger girl, but the writer believes the girl is too young, even though she's legally an adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so the relationship is legally allowed. The writer mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that maybe the girl's age is close to the legal limit now. But since she's 18, it's legal. So, legally, there's no issue. However, the writer feels the girl looks much younger, which might be a concern about her maturity or perception by others.\n\nNext, the writer's motivation. They're trying to protect their friend from potential regret or a situation where the girl isn't emotionally ready. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with women, so the writer might be trying to help him find someone more suitable. But is it their place to interfere? The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions, even if they're questionable. The writer is acting as a gatekeeper, which could be overstepping.\n\nThen there's the question of the writer's approach. They talked to the girl directly and told her it wouldn't be a good idea, which might come off as controlling or interfering. The girl responded shyly, laughing, which could indicate she's not taking it seriously. The writer and their friend are trying to keep the two apart, which might be more harmful if the friend feels that his autonomy is being violated.\n\nAnother angle is the writer's own feelings. They find the situation creepy, which might be a personal bias rather than a valid concern. Age differences in relationships, even significant ones, aren't inherently problematic as long as both parties are consenting adults. The writer's discomfort could stem from their own values or societal norms, but that doesn't necessarily make the relationship wrong.\n\nAlso, the friend's perspective is important. If he's making his own decisions and the girl is willing, the writer's interference might prevent him from forming a relationship he genuinely wants. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or coercion, it's up to the friend to navigate his own choices.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's intentions might be to help their friend, they're infringing on his autonomy as an adult. The age difference is legal, and the writer's actions could be seen as controlling. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
