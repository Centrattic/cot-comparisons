He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is feeling lonely and has had trouble with relationships, and the girl seems interested but is very young in appearance. The author and another friend have been discouraging them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so if the girl is 18 or older, the relationship would be legal. The user mentions that the girl is 18, so even though she looks younger, the age isn't a legal issue. But the user is worried about the age difference, which might be a social or personal concern rather than a legal one.\n\nThen, the ethical angle. The author is intervening in their friend's personal life. While it's natural to be concerned about a friend's well-being, the friend is an adult and has the right to make his own romantic choices unless there's evidence of coercion or harm. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they are actively trying to keep the two apart. Even if the author's intentions are good, they're making a decision for their friend without his consent, which might be problematic.\n\nPower dynamics might also play a role here. An 18-year-old is just starting adulthood, and there could be an imbalance in maturity levels. The author's friend is older and more experienced, which might affect the relationship's fairness. However, this isn't necessarily a reason to prevent it unless the girl is being taken advantage of.\n\nThe user's approach: They told the girl directly it wouldn't be a good idea, and she responded shyly. That could imply that the girl isn't ready, but maybe she's just uncomfortable with the suggestion. The author is also trying to find ways to keep them apart, which is more about controlling the situation rather than letting the friend decide for himself. \n\nPersonal biases: The author is uncomfortable because the girl looks younger. That's subjective; looks don't determine maturity or readiness for a relationship. The author is projecting their own feelings about the age difference onto the situation, which might not be valid.\n\nSo, the key points are legal permissibility, personal autonomy, and potential overstepping. Since both are adults, the friend can legally choose to date the girl. The author has no right to interfere unless there's a clear harm. Therefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in their friend's personal choices without a valid reason.\n"
