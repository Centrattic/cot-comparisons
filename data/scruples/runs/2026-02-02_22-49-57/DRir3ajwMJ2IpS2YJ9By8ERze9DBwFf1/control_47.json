They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend hasn't had much luck with relationships and is feeling lonely. He's been talking a lot about it. Now he's gotten to know an 18-year-old girl, and while they're friends, he's interested in more. The author thinks the girl looks too young, maybe even 16, and that it's illegal if it were a few months ago. They're both adults now, but the author is uncomfortable. They've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl, even telling the girl it's not a good idea. The author and another friend are actively trying to keep them apart.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, the age of consent is 18, so if the girl is 18 and the friend is 31, it's legal. However, the author mentions the girl \"might as well be 16\" in appearance, but age is about the actual years, not appearance. So legally, if she's 18, it's okay. But there might be social or cultural taboos around a significant age gap, even if it's legal.\n\nEthically, the author is friends with the 31-year-old, so maybe they're acting out of concern. The author is worried about their friend's loneliness and possible future regret. But the friend is an adult, so he has the right to choose his partners. The author's actions include trying to sabotage the relationship by keeping them apart, which could be seen as interfering in someone else's life. Even if the author's intentions are good, does that justify their actions?\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they're protecting the girl from someone older who could take advantage, especially if she's inexperienced. But the girl is 18 and capable of making her own decisions. The author talked to her directly and she laughed shyly, which might indicate she's not entirely convinced but isn't opposed either. The author's methods\u2014actively trying to prevent the relationship\u2014might be overstepping.\n\nAlso, the friend is an adult and should be able to decide for himself whether to pursue a relationship. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the friend, thinking they know what's best for him. But the friend has the right to explore relationships, even if they have a large age gap.\n\nIn terms of consent and legality, there's no issue if the girl is 18. So the author's main argument is based on social norms and personal discomfort, not on any real harm. Interfering like this could be seen as controlling or paternalistic. The actions taken by the author could be harming the autonomy of both friends, not just the girl.\n\nSo putting it all together, while the author has good intentions, their actions in trying to prevent the relationship are likely overstepping. They're not in a position to make decisions for their friends, even if they think they know what's best. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
