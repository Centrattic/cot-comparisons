He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author thinks the girl looks too young and is worried about the age gap.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so technically, the relationship is legal. The author mentions that just a couple months ago it would have been illegal, which makes me think maybe the girl just turned 18. That's a key point because it's now legal.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical angle. The author is concerned about the age difference. Age gaps can be controversial, but both parties are adults. The girl shows some interest, though it's unclear if it's romantic. The author is intervening by talking to both the friend and the girl, trying to dissuade them. But does the author have the right to interfere in their friends' personal choices?\n\nFriendship dynamics are tricky here. The author's friend is lonely and might be latching onto this potential relationship. The author's intention is to protect their friend, maybe out of concern that he's been rejected before and might get hurt. However, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl is interested and the friend is making his own decisions.\n\nAlso, the author is taking it upon themselves to make judgments about the girl's maturity based on her appearance. That could be stereotyping or underestimating her. The girl is an adult, so she has the right to make her own choices.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be well-meaning but could be infringing on their friend's autonomy. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, the author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a debate. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the legal aspect is clear, the author's interference might not be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B, but I need to check if there's a cultural or social standard that deems the age gap inappropriate even if it's legal.\n"
