He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from getting involved with an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger. But legally, as long as both are adults, it's okay.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is concerned about the age gap and the girl's maturity level. However, the girl is an adult, and if she's showing genuine interest, it's her choice. The author is intervening without the couple's agreement, which might be overstepping. \n\nAlso, the author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to both parties and trying to keep them apart. That could be seen as manipulating the situation. Even if the author's intentions are good, they're not in a position to decide for their friend or the girl. \n\nThe friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships before. The author's actions might be stemming from caring, but they should respect both individuals' autonomy. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, it's not the author's place to interfere.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably overstepping by trying to control their friend's romantic choices. They might not be in the wrong legally or ethically if the relationship is consensual, but their actions are intrusive. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
