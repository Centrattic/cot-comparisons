He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old, and the author is trying to stop them. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: The age of consent varies by jurisdiction. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal. That might mean the girl is just barely over the legal age, maybe 18, and the legal age in their area is 18. So, if it's legal now, there's no legal issue. But even if it's legal, there could be concerns about the age difference.\n\nNext, the power dynamic. An 18-year-old is a recent minor, still in the early stages of adulthood. A 31-year-old is significantly older, which could create an imbalance in the relationship. The author is worried about this, thinking she looks younger and might not be ready for such a relationship. The girl might not have the same life experience, which can affect the relationship's dynamics.\n\nThe author is trying to prevent the relationship, even talking to the girl directly. That could be seen as overstepping. While the author might have good intentions, it's not their place to dictate who their friend can date. The friend is an adult and should have autonomy in his romantic choices, unless there's a clear legal or ethical violation.\n\nThe author's actions could be considered meddling. They're not just advising their friend but also approaching the girl and trying to keep them apart. This might infringe on the autonomy of both individuals. The girl is an adult and can make her own decisions, even if the author disapproves.\n\nThere's a lack of evidence that the girl isn't interested or that the relationship would be harmful. The author speculates about the girl's intentions but doesn't know for sure. It's possible she is interested and the age difference is just the author's concern. The author's judgment might be based on personal discomfort rather than the girl's actual situation.\n\nThe friend's loneliness and history of not having luck with women are also factors. The author might be trying to help by steering him towards a more \"appropriate\" relationship, but this could be paternalistic. The friend should have the right to explore relationships that make him happy, as long as they're consensual and legal.\n\nIn summary, while the age difference is significant and the author has concerns, the key points are the legal age, the autonomy of both individuals to choose their partners, and the author's overstepping by intervening directly. The author's actions might not be legally wrong but could be ethically questionable due to interfering in their friend's personal life and the girl's choices."
