He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who started a company and had a verbal agreement with the author to design the website and POS system in exchange for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend didn't pay or give the stake, and now the author is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are enforceable, but proving the terms can be hard. The author and the friend had a gentleman's agreement, which is a verbal contract. The author did the work, but the friend didn't fulfill the payment or equity part. The author still has control over the domain and webhost, and some of their code is still in use.\n\nLegally, if the author created the website and POS system as an independent contractor, the ownership of the code might belong to the author unless there was a written agreement transferring it. The friend using the code without payment could be a breach of contract, and the author might have a case for damages. However, if the friend paid someone else to maintain the systems, there's a possibility that the existing code is still under the author's control, so the friend might be infringing on the author's intellectual property rights.\n\nMorally, the situation is more complex. The friend didn't pay as agreed, cutting off contact, which adds emotional damage. The author's anger is understandable. But the proposed action\u2014disrupting the company\u2014could be seen as revenge rather than justice. Even if the author has legal rights, taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" might cross a line. It's a form of sabotage, which is typically considered unethical and illegal.\n\nThe fact that the author has access to the domain and hosting is a point in their favor for legal action, but using that access to disrupt the company would be a criminal act, regardless of the underlying dispute. There's a difference between seeking legal recourse (like suing for breach of contract or copyright infringement) and taking unilateral, destructive actions.\n\nAlso, considering the time frame: six years have passed. There might be statutes of limitations on the verbal contract and breach of contract claims, depending on the jurisdiction. If the author waited six years to act, they might be out of luck legally, but that's a detail that's not provided here. The user mentions the friend is now a millionaire, so the author's potential claim could be significant, but the method of enforcement is the issue.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were wrong, the author's proposed response is not acceptable. The author has rights but should pursue legal avenues rather than sabotage. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for considering such disruptive actions.\n"
