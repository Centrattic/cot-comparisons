He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author did the work but wasn't paid and eventually lost contact. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are enforceable, but proving the terms might be difficult without evidence. The author has a domain and hosting under their name, which could be a point in their favor. However, the friend hasn't acknowledged the agreement, so the author might not have a strong legal case unless they can prove the verbal agreement existed.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by not paying and cutting off contact. The author was left out of pocket and lost a friend. The friend's actions are definitely unethical. However, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" by disrupting the company is a form of revenge, which is ethically questionable. Even if the friend is in the wrong, retaliating could cause harm beyond what's just. The author might be justified in feeling wronged, but taking actions to sabotage could make them complicit in unethical behavior.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and code. They might have legal recourse if they can prove ownership. Instead of disrupting the company, perhaps seeking legal action or negotiating a payment would be a better approach. Disrupting the company could lead to legal consequences for the author, especially if the company was using their code without permission. The author might have a case for breach of contract, but taking revenge might not be the best path.\n\nIn summary, the friend is clearly in the wrong for breaking the agreement, but the author's plan to disrupt could also be seen as wrong. The ethical thing would be to pursue legal remedies rather than revenge. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong in terms of the initial agreement being broken, but their planned action might be ethically dubious. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the friend's actions, the author's anger is justified, but their action to disrupt is not. So maybe the answer is A? Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The question is about the author's actions. Since the author is considering sabotage, which is unethical and possibly illegal, then maybe the answer is A. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. Need to clarify: the friend is wrong, but the author's retaliation is wrong. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but the correct answer depends on the action. Since the author is planning to disrupt, which is wrong regardless of the friend's actions, so answer A.\n"
