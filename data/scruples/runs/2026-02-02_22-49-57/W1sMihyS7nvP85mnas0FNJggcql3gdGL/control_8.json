He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Be Termed for\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a friend who started a company six years ago. The author was asked to design a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't have proper invoicing tools initially. The author worked on the project, putting other projects aside, and the work took two weeks for functionality and six weeks for tweaks. A designer was hired for the frontend, paid $2000 upfront with no stake. After finishing, the friend ghosted, leading to a loss of contact. Now the friend is successful, with multiple stores and wealth, while the author hasn't received payment or acknowledgment. The friend has hired others to maintain the work, but the author still holds domain and hosting, and their code is used in the stores. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they \"fucked his shit over\" to get their $2000 and potential millions.\n\nSo, the key points here: verbal agreement, lack of formal contract, non-payment, and the author considering taking action to disrupt the friend's business.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The author might not have a strong legal case here, especially if the friend denies the agreement. However, ethically, the friend didn't follow through on the promised payment and stake. The author invested time and effort, and the friend benefited from their work without compensation.\n\nBut the author is contemplating revenge by disrupting the friend's business. That's where the moral question comes in. Even if the friend wronged them, taking matters into their own hands by sabotaging the company could be seen as wrong. The author has legal recourse options, like sending a demand letter or pursuing legal action if possible, but taking direct action to harm the business might be unethical and possibly illegal.\n\nAlso, the author still holds domain and hosting under their name. They could legally claim ownership of those assets. If they remove access or take down the site, that could be seen as within their rights if they own those assets. However, if the code is part of the company's operations, removing it could disrupt the business. The line between legal rights and ethical actions is blurry here.\n\nThe friend's actions were unethical\u2014ghosting, not paying, and using the work without compensation. The author's potential retaliation, however, might also be unethical. The situation is a conflict of rights and ethics. The author might have a case for compensation, but disrupting the business could be considered over the top.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA framework, the question is whether the author would be in the wrong for their actions. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified. If the author takes legal steps, it's different than taking destructive actions. The scenario as described includes the author considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which is a strong, possibly illegal action. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for taking revenge instead of seeking legal remedies.\n"
