He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. The agreement was verbal: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects on hold, and then was ghosted. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are valid but hard to enforce, especially if there's no evidence. The friend didn't pay, and the author hasn't received any compensation. The author still holds domain and hosting in their name, and the code is their property because there was no payment for exclusive rights. So if the author wants to take action, like shutting down the site or stopping access, they might have a legal point since the company is using their work without permission.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is hurtful. The author feels wronged and is now considering revenge. But disrupting the company could have serious consequences. Even if the author has rights, taking actions like removing the domain or code might be seen as using a position of advantage for personal gain. The friend might have a defense, like arguing that the verbal agreement wasn't binding or that the author didn't deliver the agreed-upon terms. Also, the author's initial intent was to help a friend, which might make the situation more about betrayal than just money.\n\nBut the key points are: the agreement existed, the author delivered the work, and the friend didn't pay. The author's ownership of the domain and code gives them leverage. However, the author is now considering \"fucking over\" the friend's company, which could include legal actions (like revoking access) or something more malicious. If the author is using their legal rights to claim payment or ownership, that's not in the wrong. But if they are taking destructive actions beyond what's legally justified, that's different.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if they have the rights, maybe not. Ethically, taking down a successful company in revenge could be seen as wrong, even if the friend wronged them. But the friend breaking a verbal agreement and ghosting is unethical. The author might have a valid claim but could also be overstepping if they act out of spite. The answer might depend on whether the actions are framed as reclaiming their rights or as sabotage. Since the author mentions they still have access and the code is their property, they might have a legal basis for asserting their rights. However, the way to proceed ethically would be to pursue legal remedies rather than destructive actions. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they need to consider proper legal channels instead of revenge. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong for not having a written contract and now acting out of anger. But the friend's end didn't provide any invoices or formal agreements either at the time. The author's actions could be justified if they are asserting their legal rights, but if it's purely revenge, then it's not. The original question is if the author is in the wrong for disrupting the company. The answer hinges on whether their actions are legally and ethically justified based on the verbal agreement and their current ownership. Since there's a valid claim (albeit based on a verbal contract), the author might not be in the wrong, but the approach of \"fucking over\" could be problematic. So the answer is B, but with the caveat that legal action is better than sabotage. However, the user is only asking if the author is in the wrong, not the best approach. So if the author is taking action based on a valid claim, even if it's through strong measures, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're just acting out of spite without legal grounds, then A. The details suggest they might have some legal standing, so B.\n"
