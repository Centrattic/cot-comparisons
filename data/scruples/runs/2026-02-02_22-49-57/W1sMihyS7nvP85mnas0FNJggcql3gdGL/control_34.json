He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author did some work for a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be enforceable, but it's harder to prove without written evidence. The author mentioned a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" which is just a handshake deal. Without any written contract or witnesses, it might be tough to take this to court. The friend ghosted, so there's no communication. The author might have a case in terms of contract law, but without proof, it's tricky.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author did the work, and the friend didn't pay. The author is upset and wants to get back the money and the stake. But taking action to \"fuck his shit over\" sounds like sabotage. Even if the author has a claim, sabotaging a company is illegal and unethical. It could lead to legal trouble for the author. Instead of taking revenge, the proper step would be to try to negotiate, send a demand letter, or pursue legal action through small claims court if possible.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and code. Maybe they could sell that or demand compensation through a legal channel. But disrupting operations would be a crime, like hacking or interfering with business, which is a big no-no. The author's anger is understandable, but the method of seeking redress is not appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend did break the agreement and didn't pay. The author might feel wronged. However, the solution isn't to retaliate in a harmful way. There are legal avenues, even if they're not as effective as the author might hope. The key point here is that taking the law into your own hands by sabotaging someone's business is wrong, regardless of the grievance.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling wronged, but planning to disrupt the company is illegal and unethical. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're considering illegal actions to resolve a dispute, which is not acceptable.\n"
