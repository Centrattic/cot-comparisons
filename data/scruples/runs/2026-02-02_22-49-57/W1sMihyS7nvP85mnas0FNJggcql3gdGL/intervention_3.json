He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. The situation started with a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake for designing a website and POS system. The friend, now a multi-millionaire, never paid and cut off contact. The author still has legal ownership of the domain, hosting, and some code, and the friend uses their work without permission.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be enforceable, but proving them is hard. The problem here is that there's no written contract, so the friend might deny it existed. Even if the author could prove the agreement existed, enforcing it could be tricky after six years. Statutes of limitations might apply here, depending on the location. The author's claim for payment and equity might be time-barred.\n\nThen there's the issue of intellectual property. The author kept the domain and hosting in their name, which suggests they might still own the code. If the code is under the author's copyright, the friend using it without permission could be infringing. But if the author created it as a work-for-hire, or if the terms implied transferring rights upon completion, that might change things. Since there's no written contract, it's unclear. The author might have some rights to the code, but the friend has been using it for years, possibly leading to issues like implied license or abandonment.\n\nThe author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is vague. If they take down the website or stop maintenance, that could be considered sabotage or interference with business operations. Even if the author has legal rights, disrupting the company could lead to legal repercussions. The friend could sue for damages, and the author might face charges for causing loss.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author's friend ghosted them, which is hurtful, but that's a separate issue. Seeking revenge through legal means is complicated. The author's actions might be seen as petty or malicious, even if they have a valid legal claim.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has a right to be compensated for their work, but taking actions that harm the company could be ethically questionable. There's a better approach, like seeking legal advice to pursue a claim for payment and ownership, rather than sabotage.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a grievance, but their proposed actions could be problematic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the author has legal rights, they might be justified in pursuing them, but the method of \"disrupting\" the company could be wrong. Alternatively, if their actions are illegal or unethical, then they are in the wrong.\n\nBut given the information, the main issues are the enforceability of the verbal agreement and the legal rights over the code. The author might have a case, but the way they're considering handling it is where the problem lies. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), but their actions could still lead to consequences. The key is that the friend's breach of agreement is the issue, but the author's response needs to be within legal bounds.\n"
