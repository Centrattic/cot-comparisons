He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment of $2000 and a 5% stake in the company. The friend didn't follow through, leading to the author feeling wronged.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the verbal agreement's enforceability. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be valid but are hard to prove, especially without any documentation. The friend never paid or gave the stake, and instead ghosted the author. Now the company is worth millions, and the author is considering taking action to reclaim what they believe is owed.\n\nThe author mentions having control over the domain, webhost, and some code. They could potentially take these down, but that would be malicious. The question is whether that action is justified.\n\nLegally, the author might have a case if they can prove the verbal agreement, but practically, enforcing it could be difficult. Ethically, however, retaliating by disrupting the company's operations could be seen as wrong. Even if the friend breached the agreement, destroying or damaging the company's assets isn't a legal or ethical response. The author might have other options like sending a cease and desist or pursuing legal action, but taking direct action to \"fuck his shit over\" is likely not justified and could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is clear\u2014the author felt betrayed and wants justice. But retaliating in such a way could make the situation worse and might not achieve the desired outcome. It's important to consider legal remedies rather than personal vengeance. So, while the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, the author's potential actions are not the right approach. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for considering such disruptive actions.\n"
