He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake, but the friend ghosted after the work was done and didn't pay. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it because the friend didn't pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, while verbal contracts are legally binding, they can be hard to enforce because there's no written record. The author might have a case if they can prove the agreement existed, but the burden of proof is on them. Since the friend didn't pay and the author didn't follow up, maybe there's no legal recourse.\n\nThen there's the moral question. The author did the work, put in time and effort, and the friend didn't pay, which is a breach of trust. But the author is now considering sabotaging the friend's company. Even if the friend was wrong in not paying, the author's retaliation might be disproportionate. The friend might have thought the verbal agreement was different or changed his mind. The author's actions could be seen as revenge, which isn't the right approach.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and hosting. Maybe they have the right to pursue payment, but using that control to disrupt the company raises ethical concerns. It's like a power struggle where the author is holding onto assets. Legally, if the domain and hosting are in their name, they might have some leverage, but ethically, sabotaging a business is a big step.\n\nThe fact that the friend ghosted and deleted messages shows a lack of communication. The author might have been owed money but didn't press the issue. Now, after years, considering revenge could be seen as the author's overreaction. Instead of disrupting the company, they should have pursued legal action or at least tried to negotiate.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for not being paid, but the idea of disrupting the company to get revenge is wrong. It's better to handle it through legal means rather than taking matters into their own hands with sabotage.\n"
