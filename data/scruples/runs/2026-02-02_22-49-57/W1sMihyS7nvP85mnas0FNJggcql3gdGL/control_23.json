He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is at fault. The situation involves a friend starting a company and asking the author to design the website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the friend's business because they haven't been paid.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects. The main points are the verbal agreement, the lack of payment, and the current access the author has to the domain and code. Legally, verbal agreements can be binding, but they're hard to prove. Since there's no written contract or witnesses, it might be difficult for the author to enforce the 5% stake or the $2000 payment. Ethically, the friend didn't hold up their end of the deal, which is unfair. However, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" by possibly sabotaging the business is definitely illegal and unethical.\n\nThe author has access to the domain and code because they were registered under their name. If they were paid $2000 (even though they weren't), maybe the ownership of the code would transfer, but since payment wasn't made, the author might still hold rights. However, using that as leverage to disrupt the business is problematic. Even if the friend is in the wrong, retaliating with sabotage is not acceptable. The author should pursue legal channels if possible, like small claims court for the $2000, but the 5% stake is a different matter. \n\nThe key here is that while the friend is at fault for not honoring the agreement, the author's response is also wrong. Sabotage is illegal and could lead to criminal charges. The author might be within their rights in terms of the original work's ownership, but using that to harm the friend's business is not permissible. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their actions, while possibly justified in feeling, are unethical and illegal. They should seek legal recourse instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
