He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend started a company six years ago and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement where the author would get $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects aside, and the friend later ghosted them. The author hasn't been paid or acknowledged properly. Now, the friend is successful with multiple stores and the author is thinking of taking action to \"fuck his shit over\" because of the unpaid $2000 and the stake.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, a contract needs to be in writing, especially for stakes in a company. The author might not have legal recourse here because there's no written proof. But ethically, did the friend break the agreement? The friend did benefit from the author's work, and there's a sense of betrayal since they were friends.\n\nHowever, taking retaliatory action by disrupting the company could be illegal. The author mentions having access to the domain and code, but hacking or damaging a company's systems is a criminal offense regardless of the reason. Even if the author feels wronged, the response could be seen as vandalism or sabotage, which is a legal issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions of ghosting and not honoring the agreement are clearly unethical. But that doesn't justify illegal actions. The author's intention might be to seek justice or revenge, but the method could cross legal boundaries.\n\nSo, even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's potential actions could make them legally culpable. Therefore, while the friend is at fault, the author might be in the wrong for considering such disruptive measures. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm, maybe the answer depends on the perspective\u2014legal vs. ethical. Legally, the author might be in the wrong if they act, but ethically, the friend's actions are worse. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt, which is a criminal act regardless of the reason. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because taking such actions is illegal and unethical, even if the friend was wrong.\n"
