He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now, years later, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his business to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be hard. The author has no written proof of the 5% stake or the $2000 payment. The friend might not even remember the agreement, or it could be contested. So legally, the author might not have a strong case unless they can prove the agreement existed.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions they put other projects on hold and worked hard on this. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact. That's definitely hurtful and unfair. But the author is now considering disrupting the friend's business. That could involve things like taking down the website or the POS system, which could harm the company's operations. Is that justified? It depends on how you look at it. Some might say the author is taking revenge, which isn't right. Others might argue they're trying to get what was owed to them.\n\nThe author still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. Legally, if the author hasn't transferred the rights, they might own the intellectual property. So, they could have a case to demand payment or compensation. But using that to disrupt the business could be seen as extortion or threatening, which is illegal. Even if they have a claim, using sabotage isn't the right approach. They should probably seek legal advice to pursue their rights through proper channels instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAlso, the relationship aspect. The author mentions wanting their friend back. The friend's behavior was poor, but the author's response of considering sabotage might not be the best way to handle it. It could lead to further conflict and legal issues. The author might be in the wrong because they're planning to harm someone else's business, even if they feel wronged. There are proper ways to resolve disputes, like small claims court or mediation, rather than taking destructive actions.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were definitely unethical and possibly illegal in not fulfilling the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the business could also be illegal and unethical. The author should seek legal recourse instead of taking revenge. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the business rather than using legal means.\n"
