He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author, who's a friend, did some programming work for a friend's startup six years ago. They had a verbal agreement where the author would get $2000 and 5% of the company. The friend started the company, the author worked on the website and POS system, but after the work was done, the friend ghosted them. Now the friend's company is worth millions, and the author is considering messing up the company's systems to get revenge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court, but sometimes verbal contracts can be enforceable depending on the jurisdiction. The author still has control over the domain, hosting, and parts of the code. They mention that they weren't paid and that the company is using their work. So maybe there's a case for breach of contract or unauthorized use of intellectual property. But even if there is, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" sounds like a threat of sabotage, which is illegal regardless of the situation.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if the friend wronged the author, taking revenge by disrupting a company is unethical. The author could be causing significant harm to the company, which might have customers, employees, and other stakeholders. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences for themselves, like charges of vandalism or hacking. Also, the author mentions wanting revenge, which is a personal grievance but doesn't justify illegal or unethical actions.\n\nAnother point is the friendship. The author tried to maintain contact but was ignored. The friend might have had reasons for cutting off communication, maybe related to the financial dispute. But the author's response of threatening sabotage is not a constructive way to resolve the issue. The author should consider legal means to pursue payment or compensation instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThe fact that the author still has access to the domain and hosting could be a point in their favor if they want to negotiate or demand payment legally. They might need to consult a lawyer to explore their options, like suing for the unpaid $2000 and the 5% stake. However, the way they're thinking about \"fucking over\" the company is definitely not the right path.\n\nSo putting it all together, even if the friend was wrong in not honoring the agreement, the author's plan is not justified. They should pursue legal avenues, not take revenge. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
