He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author (let's call them \"Coder\") did work for a friend who started a company. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. Coder did the backend, a designer did the frontend for $2000. The friend (let's call him \"Friend\") ghosted after the work was done, didn't pay, and the company became successful. Now Coder is considering disrupting Friend's business to get their money and stake.\n\nSo, the question is whether Coder is in the wrong. The user thinks they aren't, but wants confirmation. Let me think through the legal and ethical angles.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. They can be enforced, but it's harder without proof. The Coder has no written contract, so Friend might not be legally obligated to pay. However, there's the argument that Coder did the work, and Friend is using their property (domain, code) without permission. If the domain and code are still in Coder's name, they technically own them, so using them without consent could be a legal issue. Coder could possibly have a case there, especially if they can prove ownership and that Friend is using their work without proper licensing.\n\nEthically, Friend broke the agreement by not paying and cutting off communication. That's pretty clear. But Coder's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is a disruption, which could involve hacking, removing access, or other destructive actions. Even if Coder has a right to compensation, taking matters into their own hands could cross into illegal territory. For example, if they shut down the POS system, that could be considered sabotage or a criminal act, even if they own the code. There's also the question of proportionality. Seeking compensation through legal means (like suing) is one thing, but actively damaging the business could be seen as revenge rather than a just claim.\n\nAnother angle: Friend might have forgotten or changed the terms, but Coder has the code and domain in their name. They could potentially sell or license the code, but instead, they're threatening to disrupt the business. That might be seen as holding someone hostage, which isn't right. Even if Friend is in the wrong, Coder's response could be illegal and unethical if it causes harm beyond seeking rightful compensation.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect. Coder is upset about losing a friend and not being paid. But using that as a reason to disrupt a business might not be justified. There are legal avenues to pursue the debt and stake, and maybe even recover the friendship if approached differently. Resorting to sabotage could make things worse legally and ethically.\n\nIn summary, while Friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, Coder's plan to disrupt the business could be both illegal and unethical. Even if they have a valid claim, the method of enforcement is problematic. So, the answer would be A (Coder is in the wrong) because their actions, despite the friend's wrongdoing, are not the right way to handle it.\n"
