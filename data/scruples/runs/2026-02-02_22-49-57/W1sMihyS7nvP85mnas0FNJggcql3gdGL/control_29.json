He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author did some work for their friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement where the friend would pay $2000 plus a 5% stake. The author worked on the website and POS system, taking two weeks to get it functional and another six weeks for tweaks. The friend hired a designer who was paid upfront but didn't get a stake. Then, after the work was done, the friend ghosted the author, cutting off communication. Now, the friend's company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, certain contracts need to be in writing to be enforceable, especially for stakes in a business. The author might not have a legal claim because there's no written contract. Even if there was a verbal agreement, proving it could be difficult. The author mentions that they still have access to the domain and hosting, which they might own, so there's a question of intellectual property rights. If the code is still under the author's ownership, they might have a case to claim payment or compensation.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unfair to the author. However, the author is considering disrupting the company, which could harm the friend's business. Depending on what the author does, like removing access or damaging the systems, it might be seen as revenge rather than a just action. Even if the author has legal rights, taking actions that disrupt the business could lead to legal repercussions, even if they were initially wronged.\n\nThe author's emotional response is understandable\u2014they invested time and effort and were promised a stake but got nothing. But the question is whether their potential actions are justified. If they take down the website or disable the POS system, it's a form of retaliation. Even if they have a claim, using such tactics might be considered wrong because it's damaging someone else's business. Legally, the friend might owe them money, but the author's response could be seen as criminal or unethical beyond just being a civil matter.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has hired someone else to maintain the systems over the years, but still uses the original work. That could imply that the friend is using the author's work without permission, which might give the author leverage. However, the method of enforcing that leverage matters. Instead of disrupting the business, the author might be better off seeking legal advice to pursue a claim for the unpaid amount and the stake.\n\nIn summary, the author might have a case against their friend for breach of contract, but responding by disrupting the company could be both illegal and morally questionable. The right approach would be to seek legal remedies rather than taking matters into their own hands. So, even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's actions might be considered their own wrongdoing.\n"
