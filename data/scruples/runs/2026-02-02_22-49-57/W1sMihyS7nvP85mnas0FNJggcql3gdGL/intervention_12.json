He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a business, and the author helped build the website and POS system under a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend later ghosted, didn't pay, and the company became successful. Now the author is considering disrupting the friend's business to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court, but there's also the fact that the author retains ownership of the domain, web host, and code. If the author still owns the code, then the friend might be infringing on their intellectual property by using it without permission. Legally, the author could have grounds to demand payment or to stop the use of their work. However, using the threat of disrupting the business might be considered blackmail or extortion, which is illegal regardless of the situation.\n\nMoral-wise, the friend did breach the agreement and didn't pay as promised, which is unfair to the author. The author contributed significant work and was then ghosted. However, taking revenge by disrupting the business could be seen as unethical, even if the friend is in the wrong. The author might feel justified in seeking compensation, but the method of doing so could be problematic.\n\nThere's also the aspect of friendship. The friend's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's response could lead to further conflict and potential legal issues. The friend's company is successful now, so the stakes are high. The author has a valid claim to payment and ownership, but the approach to enforce it could backfire legally.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were unjust, the author's plan to disrupt the business might not be legally sound or ethically appropriate. The right course of action would be to pursue legal channels, such as sending a cease and desist letter or going to court, rather than taking direct disruptive measures. So, the author might not be in the wrong for seeking compensation, but the method of disrupting the business could make them legally liable. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions could be illegal, even if the initial situation was unfair.\n"
