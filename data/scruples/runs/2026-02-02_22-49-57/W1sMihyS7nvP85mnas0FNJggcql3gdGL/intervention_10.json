He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay, ghosted the author, and the company became a multi-million dollar success. Now the author is considering disrupting the company to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many places isn't legally enforceable. That might be a problem. Even if the author did the work, without a written contract, it's hard to prove the terms. The friend could argue that there was no formal agreement, especially since he paid the designer in cash and didn't give the author a stake. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, but if it's in their name, maybe they have a claim there. But hacking or disrupting the systems could be illegal.\n\nEthically, the friend broke a promise and didn't follow through on the verbal agreement. The author did the work and was left out of the success. But taking revenge by disrupting the company could cause harm beyond just getting the money owed. The friend is retired now, so maybe the impact is different. Also, the author wasn't invited to the wedding, which suggests the relationship is broken. However, the author's actions could be seen as spiteful rather than just seeking justice.\n\nThe author mentions they still have access to the systems and the code is being used. If they remove the code or take down the website, that's a direct impact. But legally, even if they own the domain and hosting, the company might have legitimate use of the code under some license, especially if the author didn't transfer ownership. So, the author's actions could lead to legal trouble for sabotage or theft of services.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author has a right to be upset, but retaliating might not be the right approach. There might be other ways to seek resolution, like legal action if they can prove the verbal agreement. However, without evidence, that's hard. So the author is in a tough spot where they're wronged but their response might not be justified legally or ethically.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might not have a strong case due to the verbal agreement. Ethically, the friend was wrong, but the author's planned actions could be harmful and illegal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for considering such drastic measures instead of seeking legal advice or another resolution.\n"
