He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it for two weeks and then six more weeks for tweaks. Then the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful with multiple stores. The friend hasn't paid or acknowledged the author, and now the author is considering disrupting the friend's company.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which can be tricky. In many places, verbal agreements are legally binding, but proving them can be hard. The author has the domain and hosting under their name and some code still in use. That might help in a legal claim. But since there's no written contract, the friend might dispute the terms. However, the author has evidence like the designer being paid and the verbal agreement. \n\nEthically, the friend didn't pay for the work and reneged on the deal. The author did the work as requested, and the friend benefited from it. The author's anger is understandable, but taking revenge by disrupting the company could be illegal. Even if the author feels wronged, hacking or sabotaging the systems would likely be illegal, regardless of the situation. The author might have a case in court for breach of contract or unpaid services, but taking matters into their own hands could lead to criminal charges or further legal issues.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are considering disrupting the company. Even if they have a valid grievance, the method of seeking justice matters. Legal action would be the proper route. Sabotage would be illegal and likely make the author the wrongdoer. The friend's actions were unethical, but that doesn't justify illegal actions by the author. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the friend was in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, but the author is also in the wrong if they choose to disrupt the company through illegal means. The correct approach would be to pursue legal remedies, not revenge. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their proposed action is illegal, even if the friend was unethical.\n"
