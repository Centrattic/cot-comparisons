He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system with a verbal agreement of $2000 and 5% equity. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted after the project was done. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his business to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. There's a verbal agreement, but verbal contracts can be tricky. Legally, they are binding in many jurisdictions, but proving the terms might be difficult. The author mentions they didn't sign any official documents, which could complicate things. However, the friend had access to the work and used it, and the author still has control over the domain and hosting. That might imply some form of ongoing rights, but it's unclear. The author hasn't been paid, which is the main issue here.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by not honoring the payment and equity. The author put in a lot of work, took on the project, and then was ignored. The friend's actions seem to be in the wrong by not fulfilling the agreement. However, the author is considering taking retaliatory actions like disrupting the business, which could be illegal. For example, hacking into systems, disabling the POS, or deleting data would be criminal acts regardless of the grievance. Even if the author believes they have a right to do this, it's still illegal.\n\nAnother angle: the author might feel wronged and seek justice through legal means. Instead of taking matters into their own hands, they should consider sending a cease and desist letter, seeking legal advice to pursue the debt and equity, or maybe even filing a small claims lawsuit. Disrupting the business would not be the right approach and could lead to legal trouble for the author.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting. They could potentially sell that or demand payment for relinquishing control. However, using that access to sabotage the business is a different matter. It's a form of blackmail or extortion if they threaten to take down services unless paid. Alternatively, if they just take the actions without notice, it's vandalism or sabotage.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend was in the wrong to break the agreement, the author's response of \"fucking his shit over\" is extreme. Even if the author is owed money, taking illegal actions to get it doesn't make it right. The correct course is to pursue legal avenues. Therefore, the author would be in the wrong for considering or carrying out such disruptive actions, as it's not a legal or ethical way to resolve the dispute, despite the friend's initial betrayal.\n\nSo the answer would be A: Yes, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt their friend's business as revenge or to recover what's owed, regardless of the friend's actions. The author should pursue legal methods instead.\n"
