He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author helped start a company with a verbal agreement of $2000 and 5% stake. They worked on the website and POS system, took time off other projects, and the friend ghosted after the work was done. The company became successful, and the friend didn't pay or acknowledge the author. Now, the author is considering messing up the company's systems because they still have access.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The author might not have a legal claim, especially since there's no signed document. However, ethically, there's a case to be made. The friend didn't follow through on the agreed terms, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's emotional response is understandable. They invested time and effort expecting payment and recognition. The friend's ghosting and lack of communication added to the hurt. But seeking revenge by disrupting the company's operations could be considered over the top. Even if the friend wronged them, taking out their anger through sabotage is harmful and could backfire legally, especially if the author is found to have breached any terms or caused damage.\n\nThe fact that the author still has access to the domain and code might give them leverage, but using it to cause harm could lead to legal consequences. It's a gray area. Legally, the author might not have a strong case, but ethically, the friend's actions were wrong. However, the author's response could also be seen as disproportionate. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions might not be legally justified, but the friend's behavior was definitely unethical. The answer hinges on whether revenge is an acceptable response. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the act of disrupting the company could be seen as crossing a line, even if the friend was at fault. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because taking destructive action is not justified, regardless of the friend's wrongdoing.\n"
