He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the author of the \"What Would Be The Advice\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a multi-million-dollar company and didn't pay the author for their work, which included designing a website and POS system.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many jurisdictions isn't legally binding. That's a key point. The author might have a hard time enforcing the agreement in court because there's no written contract. However, there's also the issue of intellectual property. If the author still owns the code and domain names, they might legally have the right to remove or alter the systems, but doing so could have legal repercussions. Even if they have rights, using them to harm the company could be seen as malicious.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is considering disrupting the friend's business to get revenge for not being paid. Even if the friend wronged them, taking such action might be considered unethical. The line between seeking justice and acting out of revenge can be thin. The author's actions could damage a friend's business, which might be disproportionate to the original issue. Also, the fact that the friend has since succeeded and the author hasn't received payment for old work adds complexity. \n\nThe personal relationship aspect is important too. The friendship deteriorated after the project ended. The author was ghosted, which caused emotional distress. Now, they want to retaliate, which could completely destroy any remaining relationship. The question is whether revenge is appropriate here. Generally, acting out of vengeance, even if someone wronged you, is seen as negative. However, the situation is complicated by the financial exploitation.\n\nLooking at the details: the author worked on a verbal agreement, did the work, and hasn't been compensated. The friend has since become successful while the author is still holding onto the domain and code. The author's threat to \"fuck his shit over\" could be seen as a way to enforce the original agreement, but the method is potentially illegal and unethical. If the author removes the POS system or domain, it could cause operational issues, but they might have the legal right to do so because they own those assets.\n\nHowever, the intent here is crucial. If the author is trying to collect what they believe is owed, there might be a justification, but the method of doing so by disrupting the company is problematic. It's similar to a legal dispute where you can't take matters into your own hands. Instead, the proper course would be to pursue legal action. If the author can't do that (due to the verbal agreement's lack of enforceability), using their ownership of assets to harm the business might be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, in terms of moral responsibility, even if the friend broke the agreement, the author's response should ideally be measured. Destroying someone's business for a past debt could be viewed as excessive. The friend might have had valid reasons for not paying, though the author has no way of knowing that. The author's emotional reaction after being ghosted adds another layer, but it doesn't necessarily justify the action.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were indeed wrong, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be seen as equally wrong. The author has a valid claim to compensation, but the method of enforcement is questionable. Legally, they might not be able to enforce the verbal agreement, but ethically, using their control over company assets to retaliate is likely to be seen as harmful and unjustified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to harm their friend's business rather than seeking a legal or peaceful resolution.\n"
