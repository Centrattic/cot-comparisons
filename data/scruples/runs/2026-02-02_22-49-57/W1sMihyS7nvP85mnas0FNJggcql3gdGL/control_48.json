He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his business to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court. But in some jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be valid if there's evidence of the terms. However, proving the existence and terms of a verbal agreement can be tough without witnesses or documentation. The author mentions having access to the domain and hosting under their name, which could be assets they still own. If they built the POS system and website, they might have intellectual property rights unless transferred. If the code is still being used without proper licensing, that's a potential issue.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author was ghosted and not paid, which is unfair. But seeking revenge by disrupting the business could be seen as unethical, even if they feel wronged. The question is whether the author's actions would be justified. While the friend's actions were definitely wrong, the author's retaliation could cause harm beyond just seeking payment. It might involve illegal activities like sabotaging the website or POS systems, which could lead to legal trouble for the author.\n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Legally, the author might have a case if they can prove the verbal agreement and ownership of the code. But taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" could lead to legal issues for the author, especially if it involves hacking or disabling services. Ethically, while the friend is at fault, the author's response could be seen as excessive. There are legal avenues to pursue, like small claims court if the amount is under a certain threshold, or seeking to enforce IP rights. The author shouldn't take illegal actions, even if they feel wronged.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author is in the wrong if they disrupt the business through illegal means. Even if they have a legitimate claim, the method of seeking compensation matters. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering or taking such actions. The original question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their claim is valid. The key point is that using illegal methods to disrupt the business is wrong, regardless of the initial injustice. So the answer is A.\n"
