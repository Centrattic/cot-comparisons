He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and hired the author to design a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity, but the friend ghosted after the work was done and now the company is successful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" which might not hold up in court in many jurisdictions. Verbal contracts can be hard to enforce, especially without evidence. Plus, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which complicates things. Legally, even if there was an agreement, proving it could be an issue.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is a breach of trust. The author worked hard, took on the project despite being new, put other projects on hold, and wasn't paid. The friend's actions\u2014ghosting and not communicating\u2014show a lack of integrity. However, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" by disrupting the company is a different issue. Even if the friend is in the wrong, retaliating by damaging their business could be seen as unethical, as it's a form of revenge that harms others, possibly employees and customers.\n\nThe author's access to the domain and code might give them some leverage, but using that to disrupt the company could have legal consequences. It's possible the friend never transferred ownership of those assets properly, so the author might have a legal claim. However, taking action without due process might not be advisable. The author might be justified in seeking compensation, but the method proposed is extreme. There's a difference between seeking legal recourse and engaging in sabotage.\n\nIn terms of social norms, disrupting someone's business out of spite, even if they wronged you, is generally frowned upon. The author's frustration is understandable, but the proposed action could be considered over the line. The friend's actions were wrong, but the author could pursue legal avenues to reclaim what's theirs instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical perspectives, the author's situation is complex. The friend is in the wrong for not following through on the agreement, but the author's response might also be ethically questionable. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate and justified. While the friend's behavior is clearly problematic, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be seen as excessive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for choosing such a harsh response.\n"
