He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, there's the initial agreement. They had a verbal contract for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted and didn't pay. The author hasn't been paid and the friend is now successful. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use.\n\nNow, the author is thinking about \"fucking his shit over\" to get the $2000 and the equity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without written documentation, it's hard to enforce. The friend might argue there was no formal contract. However, the author did the work and the friend is using their intellectual property without permission. If the code is still under the author's ownership, they might have a case for copyright infringement.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is a breach of trust. The author is being wronged by not getting paid. But taking retaliatory action by disrupting the company could be seen as harmful and possibly illegal. Even if the author has a valid grievance, destroying someone's business could lead to legal consequences, like claims of sabotage or breach of peace.\n\nThe author has access to the domain and hosting, which are in their name. So technically, they own those assets. If they shut them down, it's a legal grey area. They might have a claim here, but using that as leverage to disrupt the company could be crossing a line. It's a form of coercion, which is not advisable.\n\nAlso, considering the friendship, the author wanted to maintain the relationship but was ghosted. The emotional harm is another factor. But seeking revenge through destructive actions might not be justified, even if the friend wronged them.\n\nIn summary, the author might have a legal claim regarding the unpaid work and copyright, but taking action to disrupt the company could lead to legal trouble for them as well. The ethical considerations are mixed: the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, but the author's response could also be seen as excessive. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking justice, but the method of doing so is questionable.\n"
