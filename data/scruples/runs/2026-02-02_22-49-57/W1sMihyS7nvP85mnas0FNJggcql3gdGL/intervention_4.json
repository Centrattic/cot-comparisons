He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The question is about whether they'd be at fault if they \"fucked his shit over\" to get their $2000 and the 5% stake they were promised.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend started a company six years ago. The author designed the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend ghosted after the work was done, didn't pay, and the company became successful. Now the author is considering disrupting the friend's business.\n\nSo, the key points here: verbal agreement, no written contract, ghosting, and the author still holds some assets like domain, hosting, and code. The friend is now a millionaire, and the author hasn't been paid or acknowledged.\n\nIn legal terms, verbal contracts can be valid, but they're harder to enforce, especially if there's no evidence. The problem is that without a written agreement, proving the terms (like the 5% stake) might be difficult. The author might have a case, but it's not guaranteed. However, the ethical aspect is different from the legal one. Ethically, the friend did wrong by not paying as agreed. The author might feel entitled, but taking over the business or disrupting it could be considered a form of revenge or extortion, which is both illegal and unethical.\n\nThe author has access to the domain and code. If they were to take those down, it could be seen as a breach of ethics and possibly illegal actions. Even if the author feels wronged, retaliating in a way that harms the friend's business could be considered the author being in the wrong. The proper course would be to seek legal recourse, but if that's not feasible, taking matters into one's own hands might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend didn't pay the designer, but the designer was paid upfront. That shows inconsistency in the friend's actions, but the author's response might still be unjustified. The author's actions could lead to legal trouble for the friend, but if the author is the one causing the disruption, they could face legal consequences too.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the friend is at fault, the author's actions to disrupt the business could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because taking over or damaging someone's business, even if they wronged you, is not the right approach legally or ethically.\n"
