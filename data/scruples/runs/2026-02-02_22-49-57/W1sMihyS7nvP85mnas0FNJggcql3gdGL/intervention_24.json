He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong if they disrupt their friend's successful company. \n\nFirst, the friend started a company six years ago and had a verbal agreement with the author to design the website and POS system. The agreement included $2000 and a 5% stake. The author worked on the project, but the friend ghosted them after completion. Now, the company is thriving with multiple stores, and the friend hasn't paid or acknowledged the author. The author still holds the domain and hosting under their name and some code is still used.\n\nThe main issue here is the validity of the original agreement. Since it's a verbal contract, enforceability might be tricky depending on jurisdiction. Some places have rules against verbal agreements for certain amounts or terms. Also, the friend hired another designer who was paid but not given a stake, which might hint at a pattern of not honoring agreements.\n\nThe author is considering disrupting the company. Legally, that's a problem because even if the agreement isn't enforceable, intentionally causing harm could lead to legal issues like tortious interference or damaging property. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author feels wronged and seeks retribution, which is understandable, but revenge isn't a legal defense.\n\nThe author might have valid claims for unpaid work, but taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company is risky and likely illegal. They should probably seek legal advice to pursue what's owed, rather than retaliate. Disruption could cause more harm than good and might lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, while the friend's actions were unethical, the author's planned retaliation is not a legal or ethical solution. They should pursue proper legal channels instead.\n"
