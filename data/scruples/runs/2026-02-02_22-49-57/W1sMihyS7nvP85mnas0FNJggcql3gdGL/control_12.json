He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for payment and a 5% stake. The author worked on it, but then the friend ghosted, didn't pay, and the company became successful. Now the author is considering disrupting the company because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. While they might be binding, proving the terms could be difficult. The author has the domain and hosting under their name, and parts of their code are still in use. That gives them some leverage. Ethically, the friend broke the agreement and didn't follow through on payments or the stake. The author isn't getting payment, which is a problem.\n\nHowever, the proposed action is to \"completely fuck his shit over,\" which sounds like sabotaging the company. Even if the author has a claim, taking retaliatory actions like disrupting services or removing access could be illegal. It might involve hacking, denial of service, or other illegal acts. Even if the author feels wronged, taking such actions could lead to legal consequences. \n\nAlso, the author still has access because they own the domain and hosting. If they removed access or deleted code, that could be considered damaging property, which is illegal. Ethically, while the friend was in the wrong, the author's response might cross the line into criminal behavior. The question is whether the author's actions are justified. Even if they have a claim, seeking legal recourse would be the proper path, not taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have a possible legal claim but the way they're considering enforcing it is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their intended actions are illegal and unethical, regardless of the friend's initial betrayal.\n"
