He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially disrupting their friend's company. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend started a company six years ago and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects on hold, and the friend hired a designer who got paid $2000 upfront but no stake. After the work was done, the friend ghosted, no communication. The author wanted their friend back but didn't care about the money anymore. Now, the friend is successful, owns two houses, has six stores, and is a millionaire. The author still has access to the domain and hosting, and parts of their code are still in use. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they think is owed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the verbal agreement, the lack of payment or stake, the current success of the company, and the author's potential to cause harm. The author is considering \"fucking his shit over\" to get the $2000 and the 5% stake. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be tricky. They can be enforceable, but proving the terms might be difficult. Since there's no written contract, the friend could deny the agreement existed. However, the author has some leverage because they still own the domain and hosting, and parts of the code are in use. The fact that the friend didn't pay and is now successful might lead some to think the author has a case. But disrupting the company now could be illegal, like hacking or sabotage, which is a criminal act regardless of the reason.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The friend broke the agreement, which is unfair. But taking revenge by disrupting a multi-million-dollar company could be seen as excessive. Even if the author feels wronged, using illegal or unethical methods to get what they believe is owed could make them complicit in wrongdoing. There might be legal avenues to pursue, like small claims court, but the author is considering something more drastic.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have a valid claim to the 5% stake and payment. However, the method of enforcement matters. Instead of disrupting the company, they could seek legal recourse to claim their share. But if they do something illegal, they'd be in the wrong regardless of the initial agreement.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they act illegally to disrupt the company, then yes. If they pursue legal means, maybe not. The question is about whether the author is wrong in considering the disruption. Since the action proposed is illegal, the answer would be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because their method is inappropriate, even if the initial agreement was broken.\n"
