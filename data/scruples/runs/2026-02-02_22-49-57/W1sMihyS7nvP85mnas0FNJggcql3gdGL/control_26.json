He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. The author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement\" which is basically a verbal one. If there's no written contract, proving the terms might be hard. The friend might not have to honor the 5% stake or the $2000 if there's no evidence. But the author might have some claims if they can prove the agreement existed.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author did the work, was ghosted, and now is considering disrupting the company. That could be seen as revenge. Even if they feel wronged, taking actions like removing access or sabotaging systems could be illegal. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which are critical for the website. Using that to harm the company could be considered malicious.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions of not paying and cutting off contact are clearly unethical, but the author's response of \"fucking his shit over\" might cross a line. The author could have legal recourse, like suing for breach of contract if they can prove the agreement. But taking matters into their own hands by disrupting operations could lead to legal consequences for the author, such as charges of sabotage or theft.\n\nAnother angle is the existing work. The author's code is still in use. If the author hasn't transferred the rights, the company might be using it without proper licensing. The author could potentially have a case for copyright infringement if they didn't license the code properly. However, taking down the systems could be a form of asserting those rights, but it's still a drastic and possibly illegal action.\n\nIn summary, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be both legally and ethically problematic. The author might have valid claims but should pursue legal avenues rather than taking revenge. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage the company instead of seeking proper recourse.\n"
