He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of this scenario is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend started a company six years ago. He asked the author to design the website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it for two weeks, then six more weeks for tweaks. The friend hired a designer who was paid upfront but didn't get a stake. After the work was done, the friend ghosted him, no communication. The author wanted their friend back but didn't care about the money anymore. Now the company is successful, the friend is a millionaire. The author still has domain and hosting under their name, and some code is still in use. The author is thinking of disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nHmm. So, the key issues here are the original agreement (verbal vs. written), whether the author has legal rights to the code, and if disrupting the company is justified.\n\nVerbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be hard. Since there was a gentleman's agreement with no written proof, the friend might not be legally obligated. However, the fact that the author has the domain and hosting in their name might give them some legal standing, especially if the code is still being used without proper licensing.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by not paying and cutting off contact. The author might feel wronged, but taking action by disrupting the company could be seen as revenge rather than a legal recourse. Even if the author has a case, taking down the company could cause harm beyond just seeking payment. It's a gray area. Legally, the author might have claims, but ethically, retaliating might not be the best approach. The author could have pursued legal action instead of taking matters into their own hands. So, while the friend clearly wronged the author, the author's plan to disrupt might not be justified morally or legally without proper channels.\n"
