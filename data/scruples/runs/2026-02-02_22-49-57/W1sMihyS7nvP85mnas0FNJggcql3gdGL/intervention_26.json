He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author designed a website and POS system for a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement to pay $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't follow through, ghosted the author, and now is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. Even if there was an agreement, enforcing a verbal 5% stake could be hard if the friend denies it. The author might have rights to the code since it's in their name, but using that to disrupt the company could lead to legal consequences like breach of contract or sabotage.\n\nEthically, the author is upset about being ghosted and not compensated. But taking action by \"fucking his shit over\" is extreme. Even if they feel wronged, retaliating could be seen as unethical or vengeful. The author might have other options like legal action or negotiating again, but destroying the company's systems isn't a professional solution.\n\nAlso, the friend might have valid reasons for not paying, like financial issues or disputes over the agreement's terms. The author's actions could harm innocent people, like employees or customers of the company. The ethical duty here is murky\u2014should the author pursue justice through legal means or accept the loss since the agreement wasn't formal?\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's actions were clearly wrong, the author's plan to disrupt the company crosses a line. The answer is A because the author is in the wrong for considering such extreme actions despite their grievances.\n"
