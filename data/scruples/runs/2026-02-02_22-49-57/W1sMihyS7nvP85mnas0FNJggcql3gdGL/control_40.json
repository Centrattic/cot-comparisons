He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong if they disrupt their friend's multi-million-dollar company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and a stake in the company, which wasn't followed through on. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, and now the company is successful without the author receiving any payment or credit.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: verbal agreements can be legally binding but are hard to enforce without evidence. Since there's no written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The author might not have a strong legal claim, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're in the wrong morally.\n\nEthically, the friend broke a promise. The author fulfilled their part by doing the work, and the friend didn't honor the agreement. The author is upset about being ghosted and not getting the compensation they were promised. However, taking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as harmful and counterproductive. Even if the friend was wrong, retaliating might escalate the situation and cause more harm than good.\n\nThe author still has access to the domain and hosting, and their code is being used. Legally, if the author owns these assets, they might have rights to them. However, using that access to disrupt the company could lead to legal consequences for the author, like being charged with cybercrime. Even if they have a legitimate grievance, taking matters into their own hands could backfire.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling wronged. But acting out of anger or revenge might not be the best approach. There might be better ways to seek resolution, like sending a formal demand letter or consulting a lawyer. Disrupting the company could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the initial betrayal.\n\nIn summary, while the friend clearly broke the verbal agreement and wronged the author, the author's potential retaliation could be considered wrong because it's harmful and could lead to legal issues. The right course of action would be to pursue legal remedies rather than taking direct, damaging action.\n"
