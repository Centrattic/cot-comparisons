He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they disrupt their friend's company in response to not getting paid. The scenario is that six years ago, the author designed a website and POS system for a friend's company, expecting $2000 plus 5% equity. They worked on it for two months, and the friend ghosted them afterward. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering causing trouble to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court. However, in some jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be enforceable if there's evidence of the agreement. The author mentions having access to the domain, hosting, and code, which could be considered assets they still own. If the author hasn't formally transferred ownership, they might still legally own those elements. However, the POS system being in use could complicate things. If the friend is using the author's code without permission, the author could have legal recourse. But disrupting the company (like taking down websites or systems) could be considered sabotage and potentially illegal, leading to legal consequences for the author.\n\nEthically, the author might feel entitled to payment, but using destructive methods to obtain it raises questions. Retaliation, even if justified by past actions, can lead to further harm and damage relationships. The friend's behavior was unethical\u2014ghosting and not paying\u2014so the author might feel wronged. However, the author's response of disrupting the company's operations could be seen as equally unethical, as it's causing harm beyond just seeking payment. There's also the consideration of whether the author has pursued legal channels, like small claims court, before taking such drastic actions.\n\nThe author's motives are important too. They mention not caring about the money anymore but just wanted their friend back. Now that the friendship is over, the emotional aspect adds complexity. The author might be acting out of hurt and a sense of injustice. However, the method of seeking retribution could be seen as disproportionate. The friend's success might amplify the author's sense of loss, but causing damage to the company could lead to legal issues and further personal conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. A verbal contract with no written documentation is risky for both parties. The author might not have enough evidence to enforce the payment and equity terms. Even if they had a written contract, enforcing equity in a company can be tricky, especially if the company's structure has changed over the years. The friend might have legitimate reasons for not honoring the agreement, such as financial difficulties or changes in business structure, but the author doesn't mention that.\n\nIn terms of the current situation, the author has access to systems the friend is using. Taking control of those could be a way to force negotiation, but it's risky. If the author shuts down the website or POS systems, it could cause significant harm to the business. The friend, now a millionaire, might retaliate legally, and the author could face charges like cybercrime or breach of contract. Additionally, the author's actions could damage their own reputation and any remaining relationships.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might not be in the clear if they disrupt the company, as it could be seen as malicious. Ethically, while the friend's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. The author's right to payment is questionable without a solid contract, and the method of enforcement is extreme. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking such drastic measures, even if they feel wronged.\n"
