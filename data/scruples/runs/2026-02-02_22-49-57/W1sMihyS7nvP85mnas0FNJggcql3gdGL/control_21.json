He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design their website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity, but the friend ghosted after the work was done. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While some contracts can be enforced verbally, there are exceptions, especially for equity stakes. Depending on jurisdiction, certain agreements, like those involving real estate or equity over a certain value, might require a written contract to be valid. The author might not have a legal claim because there's no written evidence. But the friend's use of the author's code and infrastructure without permission could be a different matter. If the author still owns the code and domain, they might have legal rights to it, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the verbal agreement and ghosted the author, which is clearly wrong. The author was ghosted after completing the work, which is a breach of trust. However, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is where the ethical question lies. While the friend wronged them, taking retaliatory action could be seen as harmful and possibly illegal. Even if the author has rights to the code, intentionally disrupting the company could lead to legal consequences like defamation, sabotage, or breach of contract claims.\n\nThe author's argument hinges on the idea of getting what's owed, but using disruptive tactics is not a legal or ethical solution. Instead, they should pursue legal avenues if there's a valid claim. Since the friend is now retired and successful, the author might consider consulting a lawyer to explore options like suing for the unpaid amount and equity, especially if there's enough evidence of the agreement.\n\nSo, while the friend is clearly at fault, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not justified. The right approach would be to seek legal remedies rather than take matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage the company.\n"
