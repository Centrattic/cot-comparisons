He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company six years ago and had a verbal agreement to pay the author $2000 plus 5% equity for designing a website and POS system. The author worked on it, the friend ghosted, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the verbal agreement and the lack of a written contract. In many legal systems, verbal agreements can be enforceable but are harder to prove. The author might have a case for the money and equity, but without a written contract, it's tricky. The friend's actions of ghosting and not acknowledging the author are ethically questionable, but legally, that's more about breach of contract than criminal charges.\n\nThe author has access to the domain and hosting, which are in their name. They also mention that some code is still in use. If they were to take action, like taking down the website or altering the POS system, that could be considered sabotage. Even if they feel wronged, intentionally causing damage could be illegal and unethical, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author's emotional response is understandable\u2014they invested time and effort, were promised compensation, and were ignored. However, the question is whether taking disruptive action is justified. Legally, the author might need to pursue a civil claim for the debt and equity. If the court rules in their favor, they could enforce payment. But taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company could lead to criminal charges, like vandalism or disrupting business operations.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The friend broke the verbal agreement, which is morally wrong. However, the author's response of sabotage could be seen as an eye for an eye, which some might argue is justified in a moral sense. But others might say that it's not the right approach and that legal or peaceful resolution is better, even if it's frustrating.\n\nThere's also the aspect of their friendship. The author wanted their friend back and was ignored, which adds emotional weight. But the question is about the author's actions in light of the situation. Even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's potential sabotage could be seen as wrong because it's harmful and possibly illegal.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were unethical and possibly legally actionable, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be considered unethical and illegal. The right approach might be to seek legal remedies rather than taking direct action. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their proposed actions are harmful and beyond just legal recourse.\n"
