He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The friend didn't pay and now the company is successful. The author is considering messing up the friend's business because of not getting paid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many places isn't enforceable. Even if there's a verbal agreement, without a written contract, it's hard to prove the terms. The friend might not be legally obligated to pay, even if they promised. The author might not have a solid case in court.\n\nBut then there's the ethical side. The author did the work, put in time and effort, and the friend didn't follow through. The friend is now successful and the author feels wronged. However, taking revenge by disrupting the business might be unethical and illegal. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's actions could be considered sabotage, which is illegal regardless of the motive.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting because they're in their name. Maybe the friend never transferred ownership properly. The author could legally take control of those assets, but that's different from actively disrupting the business. Disrupting operations could cause harm beyond just reclaiming what's owed.\n\nAnother angle: the author hasn't received payment, so they might have a claim on the assets they created. However, using that to cause damage could be seen as malicious. Even if the author is in the right about the payment, the method of seeking justice is questionable.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the bond was broken when the friend ghosted. But the author's response of sabotage might not be the right way to handle it. It's a lose-lose situation. Legally, the author might not have grounds for the extreme actions they're considering, and ethically, it's about whether revenge is justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their intended actions (disrupting the business) are illegal and unethical, regardless of the original dispute. Even if they feel wronged, they should pursue legal avenues rather than personal retaliation.\n"
