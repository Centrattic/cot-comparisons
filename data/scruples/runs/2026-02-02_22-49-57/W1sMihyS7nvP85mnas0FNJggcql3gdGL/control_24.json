He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author did work on a friend's website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% of the company. The friend, now a millionaire with a successful business, hasn't paid them and has ghosted them. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they \"fuck his shit over\" to get their money and the stake.\n\nSo, the main points here are the enforceability of the verbal agreement, the actions of the friend, and the potential actions of the author. \n\nVerbal agreements can be legally binding but are hard to prove without evidence. The author might not have a strong legal case, especially after six years. However, the friend's actions\u2014ghosting, using the work without payment, and not acknowledging the author\u2014seem unethical.\n\nThe author's possible retaliation includes removing access to the domain, hosting, or code. While this could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, the friend's breach of trust and failure to honor the agreement complicates things. The author might feel wronged, but using sabotage could have its own negative consequences.\n\nLegally, the author might not have a solid case, but ethically, the friend's behavior is questionable. The author's actions, while understandable in their frustration, might not be justified as they could cause harm beyond recouping their payment. However, the friend's initial betrayal is a significant factor here.\n\nI need to consider both legal and ethical angles. Legally, the author might be in a tough spot without proof, but ethically, the friend's actions were wrong. The author's retaliation could be seen as a form of justice but might cross a line into harmful behavior. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified. Since the friend broke the agreement and the author is seeking compensation, but using coercive tactics, it's a gray area. However, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because the friend's actions were unethical first. But the author's methods could be problematic. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the friend's breach justifies some form of retaliation, but the author should pursue legal avenues instead of sabotage. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. Since the author is considering disruptive actions, which are illegal if they remove services without notice, they might be in the wrong. However, the initial breach by the friend complicates it. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer is B because the friend's actions were wrong, and the author's desire for compensation is understandable, but the method of seeking it could be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their actions are wise. Since the friend didn't honor the agreement, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking to recover what's owed, even if the method is questionable. So, answer B.\n"
