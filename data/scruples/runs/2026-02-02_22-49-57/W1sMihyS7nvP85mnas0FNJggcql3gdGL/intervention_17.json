He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company after not getting paid. \n\nFirst, the situation started with a verbal agreement six years ago. The friend asked the author to design his website and POS system. The deal was $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put in two weeks of work and six more for tweaks. Then the friend ghosted them, no communication except minimal social media interactions. Now, the friend is a multimillionaire with a successful business, using the author's work. The author hasn't been paid, and the friend has hired others to maintain the systems, but the original code and domain are still in the author's name.\n\nThe author is considering \"fucking his shit over\" to get their $2000 and the 5% they were promised. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Legally, a verbal agreement can be tricky. Even if there was a verbal contract, proving it might be hard. The friend might dispute the terms, making it hard for the author to claim compensation. The author mentions having access to the domain and code, but if the company is using it, there might be legal implications if the author shuts it down. Destroying someone's business, even if they owe you money, could lead to legal consequences like defamation, sabotage, or breach of contract issues.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which was a breach of trust. However, the author retaliating by disrupting the business could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which isn't a legal solution. The author might have valid claims, but the right approach would be to pursue legal action rather than sabotage. \n\nAlso, the author's emotional investment and the long period without communication complicates things. The friend might have had reasons for cutting off contact, but that doesn't justify the author's potential sabotage. The author's actions could harm innocent employees and customers, not just the friend. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the friend broke the agreement, the author's response risks crossing a line from seeking justice to revenge. The right course is to seek legal remedies, not personal retaliation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions, regardless of the friend's wrongdoing.\n"
