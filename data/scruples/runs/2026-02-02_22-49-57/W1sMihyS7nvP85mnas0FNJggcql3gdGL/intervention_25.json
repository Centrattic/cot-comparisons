He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend didn't pay and later ghosted them. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his business to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, certain contracts, like those involving real estate or employment, need to be in writing to be enforceable. But for services rendered, a verbal agreement might hold up, but it's harder to prove. The author might have a legal claim here if they can prove the agreement existed. However, without written evidence, it's possible the friend could deny it, making it difficult for the author to win in court.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author put in a lot of work and was promised payment and equity. The friend didn't pay and cut off communication. The author feels wronged and is now considering taking drastic actions like destroying the friend's work or domain. While the friend's actions were unethical, does that justify the author doing the same? Retaliating with sabotage could be seen as morally wrong, even if the friend was in the wrong. The author could have pursued legal action or tried to negotiate, but choosing to disrupt the business might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the current situation: the author still has control over the domain and hosting. Legally, if they own the domain and hosting, they might have the right to manage it. However, if the friend has been using the author's code without permission, that's a different issue. The author could potentially take legal action to claim their rights, but intentionally disrupting the business could lead to legal trouble for the author, like charges of sabotage or theft.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship. The author mentions they wanted their friend back, but the friend ghosted them. The relationship has been severed, so the author's actions might be driven by a desire for justice or revenge. However, even if the friend was in the wrong, taking matters into one's own hands can lead to further complications and could make the author legally liable.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were unethical and possibly illegal, the author's response of disrupting the business could also be legally problematic. The author might have valid claims, but retaliating with sabotage isn't advisable. Instead, pursuing legal channels would be the proper course of action. Therefore, the author's plan is in the wrong because it's an illegal and unethical response to a problem that should be addressed through legal means.\n"
