He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. Since this was a verbal agreement, the author might not have a solid legal claim. The friend isn't paying because there's no enforceable contract. So, legally, the author might not have a case.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author did the work, but the friend didn't pay. However, taking revenge by disrupting the friend's company could be seen as unethical. Even if the friend wronged them, sabotaging the business is illegal and morally wrong. The author could face legal consequences for such actions, like copyright infringement if they remove their code without permission.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting, which they set up. That's a point in their favor regarding ownership. But using that access to disrupt operations would be illegal. The author might have the right to compensation, but not through illegal means.\n\nThe friend's actions were definitely wrong in not paying and cutting off contact, but that doesn't justify the author taking similar unethical steps. The appropriate course would be to seek legal advice to pursue any possible claims, not to retaliate.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong if they plan to disrupt the friend's company. Their actions would be illegal and unethical, regardless of the friend's past behavior. The correct answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
