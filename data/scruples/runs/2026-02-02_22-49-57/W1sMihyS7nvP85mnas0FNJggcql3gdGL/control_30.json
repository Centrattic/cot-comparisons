He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's company. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement for payment of $2000 and 5% stake in the company. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is thinking of taking action to disrupt the company over the unpaid debt.\n\nSo, legal perspective: Verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be tough. The friend might argue there was no formal agreement, especially since he paid the designer in cash but didn't pay the author. The author's continued use of their work (domain, code) could be a point, but using the code without permission might be a copyright issue if the author still holds the rights.\n\nEthically, the friend clearly breached the agreement by not paying. But the author's threat to disrupt a multi-million dollar company over unpaid debt raises questions. Even if the friend was wrong, taking retaliatory action could be seen as harmful and unjust. The author might have legal recourse through small claims court or a lawsuit, but physically or digitally disrupting the company is illegal and unethical.\n\nAlso, the author mentions having access to the domain and code. They could legally pursue compensation through proper channels instead of taking matters into their own hands. Disrupting the company would likely lead to legal trouble for the author, regardless of the friend's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company. They should seek legal advice to address the unpaid debt properly rather than resorting to sabotage.\n"
