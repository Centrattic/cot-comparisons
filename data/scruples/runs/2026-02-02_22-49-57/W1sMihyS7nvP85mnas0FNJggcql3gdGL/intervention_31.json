He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start a multi-million dollar company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted the author. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspects of verbal agreements. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to prove. Since there's no written contract, the author might have a tough time getting a court to enforce payment or the equity. However, if there were witnesses or documentation, maybe. But here, the author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement\" that only they two knew about. That makes it difficult to prove legally.\n\nThen, the author has access to the domain and webhost under their name. If the friend didn't transfer ownership, maybe the author technically owns those assets. So the friend might be using those without legal right. The POS system is still in use, and if the author didn't transfer the code's ownership, then the friend could be infringing on the author's intellectual property. That might give the author legal grounds to take action, but it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nEthically, the friend broke a verbal agreement and ghosted, which is pretty bad. The author is considering taking drastic actions to get what's owed. But disrupting the friend's business could be seen as unethical retaliation, even if the friend was wrong. The author's actions could cause significant harm beyond just getting their money. \n\nSo legally, the author might have some standing with the domain and code ownership, but enforcing it could be complicated. Ethically, the friend was in the wrong by breaking the agreement, but the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" might be overstepping into unethical territory. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're not getting their friend back, which is a personal loss. But using that as a justification to disrupt a business could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have other legal avenues, like suing for the debt, but taking matters into their own hands could lead to legal trouble for the author as well. \n\nIn summary, while the friend was clearly in the wrong by breaking the agreement, the author's plan to retaliate could also put them in the wrong both legally and ethically. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the friend's actions were worse. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. Since the author is planning to disrupt the company, which is illegal or unethical, they might be in the wrong. But the initial situation is the friend's fault. Hmm.\n"
