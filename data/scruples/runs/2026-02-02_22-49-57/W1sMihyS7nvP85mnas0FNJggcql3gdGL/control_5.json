He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them, becoming very successful while the author didn't get anything. Now the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement might not hold up in court, especially if there's no evidence. The author might not have a legal claim to the 5% stake or the $2000. But maybe they do? It depends on the jurisdiction, but in many places, verbal contracts can be valid if certain conditions are met, though proving them is hard.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author did the work, the friend didn't pay them. The friend is now successful and the author feels wronged. But using illegal means to disrupt the company would be unethical and possibly illegal. Even if the author has access to the domain and hosting, sabotaging the company's systems would be criminal.\n\nThe author might feel that their rights are violated, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" is not the right approach. Instead, legal action like suing for breach of contract (if possible) or trying to negotiate a settlement would be appropriate. However, the author might not have a strong case without written proof.\n\nAlso, the friendship seems to have ended, which adds emotional weight. But revenge actions would likely make things worse. The fact that the author still has access to some systems doesn't justify destroying them. The friend might have had a change of heart or might not realize the extent of the agreement, but that's not an excuse for the author's actions.\n\nIn summary, while the friend clearly wronged the author by not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not justified. The right approach would be to seek legal remedies, not take destructive actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong if they proceed with their current plan.\n"
