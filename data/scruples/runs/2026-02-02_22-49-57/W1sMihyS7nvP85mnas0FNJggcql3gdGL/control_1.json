He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The friend didn't pay, ghosted the author, and now is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, for a contract to be valid, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations. But verbal contracts can be hard to prove, especially if there's no written evidence. The author didn't get paid, but the friend might argue there was no formal agreement. However, the author did work and the friend is using their code without payment. \n\nThen there's the question of intellectual property. The author mentions that the code is still in their name, and they haven't transferred ownership. If the author wrote the code under their own name, they might retain the copyright. In that case, the friend is using the code without a license, which could be a legal issue. The author could potentially claim ownership of the code and demand payment or compensation.\n\nBut the author is considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which sounds like sabotage. Even if they have a legal claim, taking actions to disrupt the company could be illegal. For example, deleting code, causing system failures, or other forms of sabotage might be considered criminal acts or civil torts. The author could face legal consequences for such actions, regardless of their dispute with the friend.\n\nEthically, the situation is complicated. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is morally wrong. The author feels wronged and is seeking justice. However, seeking justice through illegal or unethical means (like sabotage) is itself problematic. The author might feel justified, but from an ethical standpoint, revenge or disruption could be seen as the wrong approach. The appropriate action would be to pursue legal remedies, such as small claims court, to seek payment and the stake.\n\nAlso, considering the long time that's passed\u2014six years\u2014there might be statutes of limitations on the claim. Depending on the jurisdiction, the time to file a lawsuit for breach of contract could have expired. The author might need to check local laws to see if they can still pursue legal action.\n\nIn summary, while the friend likely broke the agreement and might owe money, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not a legal solution and could make them liable. The right approach would be to use legal channels, not sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering disruptive actions, even if the friend was unethical.\n"
