He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and had a verbal agreement with the author to design a website and POS system in exchange for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend later ghosted the author, didn't pay, and the company became successful. Now the author is considering disrupting the company by removing access or code they still own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be legally binding, but it's harder to prove. Since there's no written contract, the author might have a hard time enforcing the terms in court. However, if the code is still under the author's ownership because they weren't paid to transfer it, the author might have legal rights to the intellectual property. That could mean they have the right to remove or alter it, but that doesn't necessarily make it ethical.\n\nEthically, even if the friend wronged the author, retaliating by disrupting the company could be seen as harmful. Taking legal action through proper channels, like suing for breach of contract, might be appropriate instead of taking matters into one's own hands. The author's actions could cause significant damage to the company and harm the friend further, which might not be justified even if the friend was unethical.\n\nAlso, the friendship aspect is important. The author mentions wanting the friend back initially but now seems to be stewing in anger. Acting out of spite, even if there's a grievance, can lead to negative consequences. The author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a fair resolution.\n\nAdditionally, there's the question of proportionality. The friend didn't pay $2000 and the 5% stake, but the company is now worth millions. Taking legal action might be the right step to seek compensation, but retaliating by disrupting operations could be excessive and cause more harm than necessary.\n\nIn summary, while the friend might be in the wrong for breaching the verbal agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be unethical and possibly illegal if it involves actions beyond their legal rights. The proper course of action would be to pursue legal remedies, not personal retaliation.\n"
