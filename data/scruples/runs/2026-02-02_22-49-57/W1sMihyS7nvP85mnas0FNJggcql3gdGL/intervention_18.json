He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and promised payment and a stake in exchange for the author's work. The friend ghosted, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original agreement was verbal, which is a problem because verbal contracts can be hard to enforce legally. The author did the work, which took time and effort, and the friend didn't follow through on the payment or the stake. The author is holding onto the domain and hosting under their name, still has access to the systems, and some of their code is still in use. The friend hasn't been in contact, except for minimal interactions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to disrupt the company. From a legal standpoint, a verbal agreement might not hold up in court. Without a written contract, proving the terms could be challenging. But from a moral standpoint, the friend didn't honor the agreement, which is a betrayal of trust. The author invested time and resources, and the friend benefited from that work without compensation.\n\nHowever, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is a form of revenge. Even if the friend is at fault, taking destructive actions might not be justified. It's important to consider the consequences. The author could pursue legal action if possible, but since it's a verbal agreement, that might not be feasible. If the domain and hosting are in the author's name, they might have legal ownership, so using that to disrupt could be within their rights. But intentionally causing harm could be seen as unethical or even illegal, depending on what actions are taken.\n\nThe emotional aspect is also significant. The author feels betrayed and wronged, and the friend's behavior has caused lasting hurt. However, revenge can escalate the situation. The author might be justified in seeking some form of compensation, but disruptive actions might cross a line. It's possible that the author is in the right regarding the unfulfilled agreement, but the method of seeking justice could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is complicated. Legally, the author might have a weak case. Morally, the friend is at fault. But the author's response could be seen as excessive. However, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are a form of self-help to recover what they believe is owed, there could be a moral justification. But if the actions are malicious or destructive beyond seeking their due, then it might be wrong. The line is blurry, but based on the information given, the author's intentions stem from a sense of betrayal and broken promises, so the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong, but the actions themselves could be questionable.\n"
