He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked for help designing a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend is successful and the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court in many jurisdictions. The author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" but the friend didn't follow through. However, without a written contract, especially for equity stakes, proving the agreement could be difficult. The author also still holds the domain and hosting under their name, which they didn't transfer. That's a point in their favor, as they might have legal ownership of those assets until transferred.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't fulfill the agreement, which is a betrayal of trust. The author was ghosted, which is hurtful and shows a lack of respect. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting the company. Disruption could involve removing access to the domain, code, or POS system. Legally, if the author still owns those assets, they might have a right to them. However, taking actions like deleting code or causing operational issues could be seen as retaliation and potentially illegal, even if they own the assets. They might be held liable for damages if they disrupt the company's operations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they're trying to get what was promised. But the method of disruption could be counterproductive. Instead of escalating, seeking legal action or mediation might be a better route. The fact that the friend is now successful and the author is considering drastic actions could be seen as vindictive rather than just seeking compensation.\n\nSo, the author's right to the assets might be debatable legally, but taking over or disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble. Ethically, while the friend wronged them, the author's response could also be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company, despite the initial betrayal.\n"
