He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, there's the initial agreement. The friend (let's call him Friend A) asked the author to build a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, putting other projects on hold. It took two weeks to get functional and six more for tweaks. A designer was involved, paid $2000 upfront but no stake. Then, after the work was done, Friend A ghosted the author. No payment, no communication. Now, years later, the company is successful, and the author is considering messing with the systems they built because they were never paid.\n\nThe author still has access to the domain, hosting, and parts of the code. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by considering to disrupt the company.\n\nSo, legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. While the author might have a claim, proving it could be tough. But the question isn't about legal rightness; it's about moral wrongness. The author feels wronged, but retaliating by disrupting a successful business could be seen as unethical. Even if Friend A didn't pay, taking matters into one's own hands by causing harm might not be the right approach. There's also the aspect of the friendship. The author tried to reach out and was ignored, leading to the loss of the friendship. Now, wanting revenge or compensation through sabotage could be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which isn't morally right.\n\nAdditionally, the author has legal avenues. They could pursue legal action to claim the owed money and stake. Destroying or sabotaging the company's systems is a criminal act and could lead to legal trouble for the author. From a moral standpoint, even if Friend A is at fault, the author's response is extreme and could cause unjust harm. There's also the consideration of the other people involved, like the designer who was paid, and customers or employees who might be affected by the disruption.\n\nSo, while Friend A is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement and ghosting, the author's plan to disrupt the company is also wrong. The right thing to do would be to seek legal recourse rather than taking revenge. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
