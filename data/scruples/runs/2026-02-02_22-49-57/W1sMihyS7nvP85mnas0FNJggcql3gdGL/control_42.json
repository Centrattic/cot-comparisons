He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author did the work, but then was ghosted and never paid. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical angles. Legally, verbal contracts can be enforceable but might be hard to prove. The author has no written agreement, so if they went to court, they might struggle to get the $2000 and the 5% stake. However, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which are in their name. The code they wrote is still being used, which could be a point in their favor if they claim ownership.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the verbal agreement, which is a problem. The author worked hard, put other projects on hold, and was then ignored. The friend didn't even acknowledge the work, leading to a loss of friendship. However, wanting to \"fuck his shit over\" is a strong action. Even if the author feels wronged, taking revenge by disrupting the company might be seen as unethical, regardless of the friend's actions.\n\nThe author's potential actions could include taking down the website or stopping the POS system. Legally, if they own the domain and hosting, they have the right to control access. But if they do something malicious, it could lead to legal trouble for the author, like theft of services or sabotage. Ethically, it's a question of whether revenge is justified. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's response could be seen as excessive.\n\nSo the author might not be in the wrong for feeling betrayed, but their plan to disrupt the company could be considered wrong. The friend's breach of contract is a problem, but the author's response might cross a line. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the friend violated an agreement, but it's important to note that the author's actions might have legal and ethical consequences.\n"
