He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Would I Be Termed a [something]?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design their website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them, cutting off all contact. Now, the friend's company is successful and the author is considering disrupting it because they haven't been paid and still have access to the domain, hosting, and some code.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author has a legitimate claim. Verbal agreements can be tricky legally. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be enforceable, but they can be hard to prove. The friend might not have intended to follow through on the 5% stake, especially since they didn't formalize it. The author worked on the project, but the friend hired a designer who was paid up front without equity. The author, on the other hand, was promised equity but got nothing. There's a sense of betrayal here, but legally, without a written contract, it's complicated.\n\nThen there's the part where the author still has access to the domain and hosting. If they set it up under their name, maybe they have legal ownership of those assets. However, the friend might have a claim if they can prove that the domain and hosting were part of the business, even if the agreement was verbal. The author's credentials for these might be personal property, but using them to disrupt the company could be illegal, like a cyberattack or theft of services. Even if the author was wronged, taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" could lead to legal consequences for sabotage or breach of service.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their POS system is still being used. If the code wasn't transferred legally, the friend might be infringing on the author's intellectual property rights. However, if the author is withholding access, that could be seen as holding the company hostage. The ethical question is whether the author has the right to retaliate by disrupting the company they helped build, even if they weren't paid. Legally, the author might not have a solid case for the equity, but they could have a case for the unpaid $2000. However, using their access to harm the company is a different issue altogether.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged and betrayed, which is understandable. But ethically, taking action that harms the company, regardless of the reason, is generally frowned upon. It's a conflict between personal grievances and professional ethics. Even if the friend broke the verbal agreement, the author's response could be considered revenge rather than a legitimate legal or ethical action. The question is whether the author's actions would be considered justified or if they overstepped.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong in terms of the initial agreement being broken, but the act of disrupting the company is where they might be. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because even if there's a claim, their response is harmful and possibly illegal. Alternatively, if the claim is strong enough, maybe the answer is B. But considering that the user is asking if they'd be in the wrong for disrupting the company, the act itself is likely unethical and could be illegal, so the answer is A.\n"
