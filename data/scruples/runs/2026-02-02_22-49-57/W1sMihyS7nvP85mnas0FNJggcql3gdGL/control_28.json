He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's successful company. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author helped build a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend didn't pay, ghosted the author, and now the company is multi-million. The author still has control over the domain, hosting, and some code, and is thinking about using that to disrupt the company.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be binding but are hard to enforce without evidence. The author might have a case for breach of contract if they can prove the agreement existed. However, since it's verbal and there's no written proof, it's tricky. The friend might argue there was no formal agreement. Also, the author still has access to the domain and code. If they created the code as an independent contractor, they might hold the copyright, meaning the friend might not have the legal right to use it without a license. So, the author could have legal standing here.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, leading to a broken friendship. The author feels wronged and is now considering retaliating. However, taking down a company's systems could be seen as sabotage, which is unethical regardless of the circumstances. Even if the author has a legitimate grievance, the method of addressing it by disrupting the company could be seen as over the top and harmful.\n\nAnother angle: the author's original intention was to help a friend's business. Now, by taking down the systems, they might be harming the business and possibly others (employees, customers) who depend on it. That adds ethical weight against the action.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has hired someone else to maintain the systems, and much of the original work isn't evident now. So, maybe the company isn't as reliant on the author's work now as they were before. However, the POS system is still in use, so disrupting that could cause real issues.\n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. They've been stewing for years and are now considering drastic action. Emotional retaliation might not be the best approach, even if the original wrong was real.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, the author might be better off pursuing legal action to claim the owed money and equity rather than taking matters into their own hands. Using their access to disrupt the company could lead to legal consequences for them, like being charged with cybercrime or sabotage.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author might have a legitimate claim but is considering unethical and possibly illegal actions. Therefore, they would be in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company, regardless of the past injustice. The correct approach would be to seek legal recourse instead of taking revenge.\n"
