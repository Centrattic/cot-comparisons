He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement where the friend would pay $2000 plus a 5% stake in the company. The work took around 8 weeks, and the friend also hired a designer who got paid $2000 upfront but no stake. After the work was done, the friend ghosted the author, not replying to messages and cutting off contact. Now, the friend is a millionaire with a successful business, and the author is considering disrupting the friend's operations to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The problem here is the lack of a written contract. Verbal agreements can be hard to enforce, especially when there's no evidence of the terms. The author mentions that there's a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" but since it's verbal and not documented, proving the terms in court would be difficult. Even though the author did the work, without a contract, the friend might not be legally obligated to pay. However, some jurisdictions recognize verbal contracts, but they require proof of the agreement's existence and terms. The author's claim for compensation might not hold up legally because there's no written evidence.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author invested time and effort into the project, believing in the friendship and the agreement. The friend, on the other hand, didn't pay and cut contact, which is unethical. The author is now considering taking drastic actions to get back what they think is owed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering such actions. Ethically, revenge or sabotage might not be justified, even if the friend wronged them. The author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and potentially illegal, regardless of the original grievance.\n\nThe author still has control over some assets, like the domain and hosting, which are in their name. They might have legal ownership of the code since it wasn't transferred to the friend. So, the author could legally take those steps to reclaim their property. However, disrupting the friend's business could be considered a form of corporate sabotage, which is illegal. Even if the author owns parts of the code, using that as leverage to disrupt the business might cross into illegal territory.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is important. The author lost a friend and feels wronged. But acting out of anger or revenge can lead to more harm, both legally and personally. The author could explore legal avenues, like small claims court if the amount is under a certain threshold, but without documentation, it's risky. Alternatively, sending a cease and desist letter or negotiating might be better options than sabotage.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were unethical and possibly illegal in terms of not honoring the verbal agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the friend's business could also lead to legal consequences. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling wronged, but their method of seeking recompense is questionable and likely illegal. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong if they proceed with sabotage.\n"
