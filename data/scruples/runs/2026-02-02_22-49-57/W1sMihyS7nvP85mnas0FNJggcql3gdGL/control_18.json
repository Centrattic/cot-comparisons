He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they designed a friend's website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The friend didn't pay and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing. Since this was a verbal agreement, the friend might have a hard time proving the terms. But the author might also not have legal standing to claim equity without a written contract. So, legally, it's a gray area. If the author wants to claim payment, they might need to go through legal channels, not take matters into their own hands.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is considering disrupting the company's operations, which could harm the business and possibly affect employees or customers. Even if the friend didn't pay, taking revenge by sabotaging the company is likely unethical. The author might feel wronged, but retaliation isn't the solution. They could be in the wrong for acting out of spite rather than pursuing a fair resolution.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and code. Maybe they could use that to negotiate or demand payment. But using that access to disrupt operations would be illegal. Unauthorized access to a company's systems is a crime regardless of the circumstances. So even if the friend didn't pay, the author can't legally take that action.\n\nEmotionally, the author is hurt and wants their friend back. But the friend ghosted them, so the relationship is already broken. The author's plan to disrupt the company might not get their friend back and could make things worse. It's a cycle of revenge that doesn't resolve the underlying issues.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend didn't honor the agreement, which is wrong. But the author's response could be seen as equally wrong because it's not a legal or ethical approach. They should seek legal advice to pursue any claims they have, not take direct action. So, even though the friend is at fault for not paying, the author is also in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company illegally.\n\nSo overall, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions would be illegal and unethical, regardless of the friend's initial failure to pay.\n"
