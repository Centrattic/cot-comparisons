He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being with a married man who says he'll leave his anorexic wife soon. The situation is a bit complex. First, the man is married, so any relationship outside of that is an affair. The author is in a secret relationship with him, and he's planning to leave his wife. The wife has anorexia, which complicates things because she's vulnerable, and they have a young child.\n\nThe man is unhappy and has tried to help her, but she's not improving. The author supports him but wants him to leave soon. The key here is that the man is still married when the affair started. Even if he's planning to leave, he hasn't done so yet. The author is involved with a married man, which is generally considered wrong because the marriage is still legally and emotionally active. The fact that the wife has a serious condition adds emotional weight, but the moral responsibility isn't absolved here. The author is part of an affair, which is unethical regardless of the circumstances. The man's intention to leave might be a justification in his mind, but until the marriage is dissolved, the relationship is adulterous. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
