He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man is married but unhappy. His wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's trying to leave but hasn't because he's worried about her and their child. The author is in a secret relationship with him, knowing this. The man says he'll leave his wife soon. The author supports him but isn't pushing too hard.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is at fault. From a moral standpoint, being in a relationship with a married person is generally considered cheating, which is frowned upon. Even if the married person is planning to leave, the act of being in a relationship while married is still adultery. The author might argue that they're helping the man find happiness, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nLegally, adultery is a civil wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. The man's situation is complicated because of his wife's health issues and their child. However, the author is still complicit in the infidelity. Even if the man is planning to leave, the author is part of a relationship that exists while he's still married. \n\nSome might say the author is in the wrong because they're engaging in an affair while the man is still married, regardless of his intentions. Others might argue that he's trying to end the marriage, so the author isn't entirely to blame. But generally, societal norms consider it wrong to be with someone who is still married, even if they're planning to leave soon. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're involved in an affair with a married man, which is typically seen as unethical. The complexities of the marriage don't absolve the author's actions.\n"
