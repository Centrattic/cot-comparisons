She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who started the affair is in the wrong. The scenario is that the man is married, his wife has anorexia and depression, and he's considering leaving. The author is in a secret relationship with him, and the question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Adultery is generally considered wrong in many cultures and religions. Even if the husband is unhappy, being in a relationship while still married is a breach of marital vows. The wife's health issues add complexity, but they don't absolve the husband or the lover of their actions.\n\nThe author is aware of the husband's situation but is still involved. They might argue that they support him and want him to leave, but the fact remains that the affair started before the divorce. The key point is that the marriage hasn't been legally ended yet. Until then, any new relationship is an affair.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's health. The husband is in a tough spot, but the author's involvement could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. Even if the husband is planning to leave, the author is still participating in the marital infidelity.\n\nAnother angle is the legal perspective. In some places, adultery can have legal consequences, especially in divorce proceedings. The author might be complicit in the breakdown of the marriage, which could be ethically questionable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is not entirely at fault if they believed the husband was going to leave soon and were supporting him through a difficult time. But intentions don't necessarily excuse actions. The act itself, regardless of intent, is still an affair.\n\nConsidering all these points, the majority view would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the affair is occurring while the husband is still legally married. The wife's health issues complicate things, but they don't justify the affair. So the answer is A.\n"
