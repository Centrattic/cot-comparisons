He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the man is married but the wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's unhappy, the marriage isn't working, but he's not ready to leave because of his wife's health and the child. The author is in a secret relationship with him, has been for 4 months, and wants him to leave but isn't pushing him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nWell, infidelity is generally considered morally wrong. Even if the married man is unhappy and has a hard situation, being in a relationship while still married is cheating. The author is involved in an affair, which is ethically questionable regardless of the circumstances. The man's reasons for staying are complex, but that doesn't justify the affair. The author might think they're helping him get out of a bad situation, but they're still participating in a marriage that's not legally or emotionally dissolved. Also, the man hasn't left his wife yet, so he's still married. The author's justification might be that he's going to leave soon, but that's not something they can control. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they're in an affair. But wait, what about the man's responsibility? He's the one who's married, so maybe part of the blame is on him. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Even if the man is making bad choices, the author is complicit by being with him while he's still married. So yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
