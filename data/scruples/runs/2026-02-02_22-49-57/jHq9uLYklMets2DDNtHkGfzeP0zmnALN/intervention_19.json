He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong for being involved with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, even though he's planning to. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the man is married, and the author is in a secret relationship with him. The key points here are that the husband is unhappy, his wife has anorexia and depression, they have a child, and he's considering leaving but hasn't yet. The author says they're waiting for him to make that move.\n\nNow, the question is about morality and whether the author is at fault. Legally, cheating is illegal in some places, but the user is asking about being in the wrong in terms of ethics or social judgment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, being in a relationship with a married person is generally considered unethical because it involves breaking the marital vows and can cause emotional harm. However, the man is said to be unhappy and trying to leave, which complicates things. The author claims to support him and not rush him, but they're still involved.\n\nSome might argue that the author is enabling the man's situation by being with him before he's actually left his wife. Others might see it as a mutual decision between adults, even if it's not ideal. The man's wife's health issues add another layer\u2014leaving could be risky for her and the child, so the author's role in this mix is tricky.\n\nI think the main ethical issue is the existing marriage. Regardless of the man's intentions, the author is part of an affair. Even if the marriage is problematic, the act of being unfaithful is typically seen as wrong. The author's justification is that they want him to leave, but they're still in a relationship before he does. It's a bit of a gray area, but traditionally, the person in the affair is considered in the wrong because they're contributing to the breakdown of a marriage, even if it's already strained.\n\nAlso, the author might be taking advantage of his difficult situation. The man's unhappiness and the wife's health issues don't absolve the author of responsibility in the affair. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) based on traditional moral standards.\n"
