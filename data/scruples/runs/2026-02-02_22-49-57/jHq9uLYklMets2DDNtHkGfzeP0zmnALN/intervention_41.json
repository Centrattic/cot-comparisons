He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being with a married man who says he'll leave his anorexic wife soon. The author and the man have been secretly dating for four months, and the man is unhappy in his marriage. His wife has anorexia, depression, and they can't go out to eat much. He's tried helping her but feels trapped because of their child. The author is told that the man is trying to find the right time to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The man is still married, so the author is involved in an affair. Affairs are generally considered morally wrong because they break trust and can cause harm to the spouse and family. However, the man is planning to leave, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe key points are: the man hasn't left yet, the author is aware of his situation, and she's encouraging him to leave but not pressuring. The man's wife has significant health issues, which might make the decision to leave more complex. There's a child involved, so the wife's health and the child's well-being are factors he's considering.\n\nThe author's position is she's not in the wrong, but others might argue that she's enabling the man's decision to stay by being with him before he leaves. Being in a relationship with someone who is still married is ethically questionable regardless of the circumstances. Even if the man is planning to leave, the author is participating in an affair, which is a breach of marital vows and potentially harmful to the wife and child.\n\nHowever, the man's situation is complicated. He's stuck between his unhappiness and his duty to his family. The author might feel she's helping him by providing emotional support, but that doesn't necessarily justify the affair. The fact that he hasn't left yet means the author is still part of an ongoing infidelity.\n\nAnother angle: if the author is genuinely trying to support the man to leave, maybe her intentions are good. But the action itself\u2014being in a relationship with someone still married\u2014is problematic. Even with good intentions, the act of cheating is a violation of the marriage contract.\n\nAlso, considering the wife's health issues, the author might not be considering how her relationship affects the wife. The wife might not even be aware of the affair, which adds another layer of harm. The man's decision to stay might be influenced by his guilt or fear of the wife's health, but the author's presence could be making it harder for him to leave or affecting his judgment.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most would say that the author is wrong because she's in an affair. The justification about the man's unhappiness and the wife's issues doesn't absolve her of responsibility. The right thing would be to wait until he's left or to end the relationship if he isn't. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
