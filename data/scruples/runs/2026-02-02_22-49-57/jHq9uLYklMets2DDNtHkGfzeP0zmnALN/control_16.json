She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man is dealing with his wife's anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's planning to leave but hasn't done so yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Adultery is generally considered wrong in many cultures and religions. The man is still married, so any relationship outside of that marriage would be cheating. The woman knows this and is involved in a secret affair. Even if she supports his decision to leave his wife, the fact remains that the marriage isn't finalized yet, so he's still legally and morally bound to his wife. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the wife's health. The wife has anorexia and depression, which are serious conditions. The man, as the husband, has a responsibility to her and their child. The woman in the affair is adding to the complexity of the situation. Even if she's not directly causing harm, she's participating in a relationship that's built on the breakdown of another's family. \n\nThe woman might argue that she's supportive and patient, but the core issue is the ongoing affair before the divorce. The man hasn't taken action yet, so the woman is complicit in a situation where the existing marriage is still intact. There's also the emotional impact on the wife and child, which the woman might not be considering. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, most people would say that being in an affair while the person is still married is unethical. The fact that the husband is unhappy doesn't justify the affair. The woman is aware of the wife's health issues but continues the relationship, which could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable situation. \n\nAdditionally, the woman's role in urging him to leave his wife might be seen as manipulative. Even if her intention is to help, the method is questionable. The key point is that the marriage isn't dissolved yet, so the affair is still happening. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the woman is in the wrong because she's engaged in an extramarital affair while the man is still married. The ethical issues here outweigh the reasons given, such as the husband's unhappiness and the wife's health problems. The right thing would be to wait until the divorce is finalized before pursuing a relationship.\n"
