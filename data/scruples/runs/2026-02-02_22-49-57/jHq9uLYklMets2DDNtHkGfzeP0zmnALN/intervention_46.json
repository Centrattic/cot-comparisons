He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong (AITA) for being in a relationship with a married man who says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The man is married, but he's unhappy because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's trying to get help for her but is hesitant to leave because he's worried about her and the child. The author is in a secret relationship with him and wants him to leave soon but isn't pushing him. \n\nThe key points here are: the man is still married, the author is having an affair, and the man hasn't left his wife yet. The author is supporting him but also in a morally ambiguous situation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong because it breaks trust and can cause harm. Even if the married person is planning to leave, the fact that the author is involved while the marriage is still intact could be seen as participating in the betrayal. However, the author might argue that they're helping the man find happiness and supporting him through a difficult time. \n\nBut legally and socially, adultery is typically frowned upon. The author is aware of the man's marital status and is still proceeding with the relationship. The man's intentions might be to leave his wife, but until he does, the author is part of an affair. The author's justification is that they're not rushing him, but the relationship itself is still extramarital.\n\nAlso, considering the wife's health issues, the man's situation is complex. However, the author's role in this could be seen as complicating things further. Even if the man is unhappy, the author is involved without the wife's knowledge, which adds another layer of ethical issues. \n\nSo, while the author might feel they're in a supportive role, the act of engaging in a relationship with a married person, regardless of the circumstances, is generally considered morally wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
