She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man is planning to leave because his wife has anorexia, they can't go out to eat, and she's depressed. He's trying to find the right time to leave for the child's sake. The author is dating this man and wants him to leave, but isn't pushing too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general perspective on infidelity or being in a relationship with a married person. Typically, most people would say that cheating or being in a relationship with someone who's married is wrong because it betrays the spouse and can harm others, especially the child. But the situation here is more complex because the wife has an eating disorder and mental health issues. The husband is struggling and wants to leave but is waiting for the right time. The author is in a secret relationship, which is a form of infidelity.\n\nHowever, the author is not the one married, so maybe the blame isn't entirely on them. Some might argue that the husband is the one who's at fault for not leaving first and for being unfaithful. The author's role is more of a participant in an affair, which is generally frowned upon. But there's also the aspect of the husband's difficult situation. The author might feel caught between his need for a relationship and the wife's condition. \n\nBut even with the husband's problems, the author is still in a relationship with someone who's not free to be in a new relationship yet. The author's justification is that they understand his situation, but it's still a breach of trust. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a societal standpoint, being in a relationship with a married person is usually considered wrong, so the answer might lean towards A (Yes). However, the nuances of the situation (the wife's mental health, the husband's intentions) might make some people view the author as less at fault. But ultimately, the act of being in a secret relationship with a married person is ethically questionable. So the answer is likely A.\n"
