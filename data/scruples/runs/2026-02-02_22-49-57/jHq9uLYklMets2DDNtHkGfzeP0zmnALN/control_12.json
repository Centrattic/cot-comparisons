He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. The man claims he's going to leave soon, but hasn't done so yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating in a relationship is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reasons. Even if the married man is unhappy, the author is involved in an affair while he's still legally married. The man's situation is complicated because of his wife's health and their child, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of responsibility. \n\nThe author is aware of the man's marital status and his struggles but is still choosing to be in a secret relationship. The fact that the man hasn't left his wife yet means he's still married, so the affair is ongoing. Even if the author supports his decision to leave, their relationship is adulterous until he actually goes through with the divorce. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and the impact on the wife and child. The wife is dealing with anorexia and depression, and the man is in a challenging position, but the author's involvement might add stress to the situation. The author might not be directly responsible for the wife's condition, but participating in an affair while the man is still married complicates things ethically.\n\nSome might argue that the author is acting out of love or understanding, but that doesn't change the fact that they're in a relationship with someone who is not free to be in it. The key point is that until the man is officially divorced, the relationship is adulterous. So the author is in the wrong because they're knowingly engaging in an affair.\n"
