      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is that they're dating a married man who says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. The man is unhappy, his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. The author is asking if it's their fault for being with him before he leaves.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The man is married, the author is in a secret relationship with him. He's trying to get out of the marriage because his wife's health issues are making the relationship difficult. The author supports him but also wants him to leave soon. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with him before he actually leaves his wife.\n\nMarriage is a legal and moral commitment. Even if the husband is unhappy, he's still married. The author is in a relationship with a married man, which is typically considered cheating or adultery. From a traditional standpoint, being in a relationship with a married person is generally seen as wrong because it breaks the commitment the husband made to his wife. But there are nuances here, like the husband being unhappy and trying to leave. However, until he actually leaves, he's still married. So the author is in a relationship with someone who's not divorced yet. \n\nThe husband's situation is complicated because of his wife's health and their child. He's trying to get help for his wife, but it's not working. He's scared to leave her alone for the child's sake. But the author is in this secret affair while he's still married. The author is told they want him to leave soon but aren't pushing him. \n\nNow, considering the moral aspect, even if the husband is planning to leave, the author is still in a relationship with someone who is legally married. So the author is in a position where they're enabling the husband to stay in the marriage longer by being with him. The husband might be using the author to fill his needs while he's still committed to his wife. The author might be complicit in the husband not taking action to leave his wife if the author is not pushing him. But the author says they told him they want him to leave soon and aren't rushing him. \n\nBut from an external perspective, regardless of the husband's situation, being in a relationship with a married person is generally considered wrong. The author is in an affair, which is typically seen as unethical. The complexities of the husband's marriage don't necessarily absolve the author's role in the affair. Even if the husband is unhappy, the author is still participating in a relationship that is unfaithful to the wife. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the husband is in a difficult situation, and the author is supporting him. But the author's actions are still part of the problem. The fact that the man is married and hasn't left yet means the author is in a relationship with someone who is not free to be in a relationship. So the author is in the wrong because they are engaging in an affair with a married man, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they are in a relationship with a married man who hasn't finalized his divorce yet. Even if the man is planning to leave, until he does, the author is participating in an extramarital affair, which is typically considered unethical.\n"
