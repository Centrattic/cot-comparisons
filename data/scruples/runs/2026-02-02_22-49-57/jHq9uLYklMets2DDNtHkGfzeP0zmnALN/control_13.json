He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man's wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. The man is trying to leave but hasn't yet because he's worried about her and their child.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are that the man is married, and the author is in a secret relationship with him. Even if the man is unhappy and considering leaving, as long as they are legally married, he is still married. So the affair is still happening while he's married. \n\nMoral and ethical standards often consider being in a relationship with someone who is married as wrong because it involves deceit and can harm all parties involved. The man's wife is suffering, and the author's relationship might be complicating his decision to leave. Even if the man is planning to leave, the author is still part of an adulterous relationship. \n\nThe author says they are not rushing him but are still in the relationship. The fact that the wife has health issues doesn't excuse the affair. The author could be enabling the man's indecision by being in the relationship, which might prolong the wife's suffering and the child's situation. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author is likely in the wrong because they are participating in an affair while the man is still married. The consequences of the affair can be significant regardless of the man's intentions. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
