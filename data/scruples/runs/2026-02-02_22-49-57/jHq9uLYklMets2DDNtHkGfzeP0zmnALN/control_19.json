He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The man is married, his wife has anorexia, depression, and low sex drive. They have a child. He's trying to leave but hasn't yet because he's worried about her and the child. The author is in a secret relationship with him, has been for 4 months, and wants him to leave soon but isn't rushing him.\n\nSo, the key points here are infidelity and the man's marital status. Even if the man is unhappy and considering leaving, as long as he's still married, any relationship with someone else is an affair. The author is participating in this affair, which is generally considered unethical or morally wrong in many societies. The fact that the wife has health issues doesn't absolve the author of responsibility because the man is still married. The author is aware of the situation but continues the relationship. \n\nThe man's intentions to leave might be valid, but until he actually takes action, the author is still complicit in the infidelity. The author might justify it by saying the man is unhappy and trying to make the right decision, but from an ethical standpoint, entering or maintaining a relationship with someone who is still married is typically frowned upon. The author's role in encouraging the man to leave could add another layer, but the main issue is the ongoing affair while he's still married. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are involved in an extramarital affair. Even if the circumstances are complex, the act of being in a relationship with a married person is generally considered unethical or wrong.\n"
