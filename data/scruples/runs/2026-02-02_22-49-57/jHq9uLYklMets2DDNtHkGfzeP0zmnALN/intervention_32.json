He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for being with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man says he's going to leave soon. The author is dating him secretly for four months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The man is married, which is a legal and emotional commitment. Even if the marriage is unhappy, he hasn't taken the step to end it. The author is in a relationship with him before that, which could be seen as complicating things. The man's wife has anorexia and depression, making the situation more sensitive. The man is trying to leave but hasn't yet, so the author is involved during that transition.\n\nSome might argue that the author is in a morally wrong situation because the man is still technically married. Others might sympathize with his unhappiness and the challenges with his wife. However, entering into a relationship while the marriage is still intact could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. Also, the author might be prolonging the man's decision by being in the picture. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they are supporting the man during a difficult time. But the key point is that the marriage hasn't been legally dissolved. The author's actions could be considered unethical because they are part of a situation that's not yet clear. Even if the man intends to leave, the act of being with someone else before the divorce is finalized is generally frowned upon. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because the relationship is adulterous and ongoing before the official separation. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
