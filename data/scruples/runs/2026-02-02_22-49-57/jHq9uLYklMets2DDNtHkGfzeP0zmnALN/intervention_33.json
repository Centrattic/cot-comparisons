He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person dating a married man is in the wrong, especially since the man hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. The question is phrased as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally frowned upon in many cultures, so being in a relationship with someone who's married could be seen as wrong. However, the man claims he's planning to leave his wife soon. The situation is complicated by his wife's anorexia and their child, which adds layers of concern about her well-being if he leaves.\n\nThe woman in the scenario is aware of the man's situation and is urging him to leave but isn't pushing him. She's taking his circumstances into account. From an ethical standpoint, even if the man is unhappy, he's still married, so any relationship with the author is an affair. Affairs are typically considered morally wrong regardless of the circumstances.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the man's marriage is not healthy, and if he's genuinely planning to leave, the author isn't entirely responsible. But the key point is that the man hasn't left yet. The author is involved in a relationship that is adulterous until he does leave. The woman's actions could be seen as enabling him to stay in a problematic situation longer, even if she's pushing for him to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman might feel that she's supporting someone who is trapped in a harmful marriage. But the fact remains that she's engaging in a relationship that is not consensual with the wife. The wife's anorexia and depression add complexity, but the author isn't in a position to make decisions for them.\n\nSo, considering the moral implications of having an affair versus the man's potential decision to leave, the author is in a morally ambiguous situation. However, since the relationship is adulterous until the man leaves, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But there's a nuance here because the man is planning to leave, which complicates things. \n\nBut in most ethical frameworks, participating in an affair is still considered wrong, regardless of the reasons. Therefore, the answer is likely AITA (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
