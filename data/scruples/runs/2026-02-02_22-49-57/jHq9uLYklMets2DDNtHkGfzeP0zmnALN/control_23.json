She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, even though he's planning to. The man is married, his wife has anorexia and depression, and he's trying to find the right time to leave. The author is dating him secretly and wants him to leave but isn't pushing him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Adultery is generally considered wrong in many cultures and religions, but the situation here is more nuanced. The husband is unhappy and considering leaving his wife, but hasn't done so yet. The author is aware of his situation and is patient, acknowledging his reasons for not leaving immediately. However, the affair is still happening while he's married.\n\nThe key points are: the man is married, the author is in a secret relationship with him, and he's planning to leave his wife. The question is whether the author is at fault. From a moral standpoint, participating in an affair is typically seen as wrong because it violates the marriage vows and can cause harm to the spouse and child. Even if the husband is planning to leave, the act of having an affair before the marriage is legally dissolved is still considered unethical by many.\n\nAnother angle is the man's responsibility. He is in a troubled marriage with a spouse who has serious health issues. He's struggling to leave because of his child and his wife's condition. The author is aware of this but still chooses to be with him. While the author might not be the one with the anorexia or depression, she's still complicit in the affair, which could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable situation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband's unhappiness and the wife's health issues make the situation more complex. The author isn't pressuring him to leave, which shows some consideration. But being in a relationship with a married man is generally considered wrong regardless of circumstances because it's a breach of trust and commitment to the spouse.\n\nAlso, the impact on the child and the wife must be considered. The affair could add stress to an already difficult situation. The author's actions might contribute to further complications for the family. Even if the husband eventually leaves, the affair is still a betrayal during the time he's legally married.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are mitigating factors, the act of being in an affair with a married person is typically seen as morally wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because engaging in a relationship while someone is still married is unethical, regardless of the reasons behind it.\n"
