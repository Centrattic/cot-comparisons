She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who started a relationship with a married man is in the wrong. The man is married but planning to leave his wife, who has anorexia and depression. They've been seeing each other secretly for four months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Infidelity is generally considered wrong in many cultures and moral systems. Even if the husband is unhappy, being in a committed marriage usually means fidelity is expected. The wife's health issues complicate things, but that doesn't ethically justify the affair. The man's situation is sad, but that doesn't make the affair right.\n\nAlso, the man hasn't left his wife yet. The author is in a relationship before the divorce is finalized, which could be seen as complicating the process or taking advantage. Even if the man is planning to leave, the author is part of an extramarital affair, which is typically viewed as morally wrong regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe author says they're not rushing him but still continue the relationship. This could imply they're aware it's not yet over but choose to proceed. The question is about whether they are in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, most would say yes because it's an affair. However, some might argue for the man's unhappiness and the wife's issues. But generally, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
