He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for being involved with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the man is married, and the woman is in a relationship with him while he's still married. That's adultery, right? But the man says he's planning to leave his wife soon. His wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child, making it complicated for him to leave. The woman in the situation says she wants him to leave soon but isn't pushing him.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether being in a relationship with a married man is wrong, even if he's planning to leave. From a moral standpoint, many people might say it's wrong because he's still married. The woman is part of an affair, which is generally considered unethical. However, the man's situation is complex\u2014his wife's health issues and their child. The woman might feel conflicted, supporting him while not wanting to rush him. But regardless of the reasons, the fact remains that the man is still married when the affair started and during the relationship.\n\nLegally, in many places, adultery isn't a crime, but socially and ethically, it's frowned upon. The woman is aware of his marital status and the challenges, yet continues the relationship. Even if the man plans to leave, until he's officially separated or divorced, the woman is in an adulterous relationship. The question is about being in the wrong, not about legal consequences. \n\nThe woman might argue she's helping him through a tough time, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of wrongdoing. The key point is that the man is still married when they are together. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because she's in a relationship with a married man who hasn't legally ended his marriage yet. The complexity of his situation doesn't negate the ethical issue here.\n"
