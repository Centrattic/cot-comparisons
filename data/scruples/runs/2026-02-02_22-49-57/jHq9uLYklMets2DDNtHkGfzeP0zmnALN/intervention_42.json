He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man has anorexia, depression, a child, and is planning to leave. The author says they're waiting for him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating in a marriage is typically seen as wrong because it breaches trust and can cause emotional harm. The man is still legally married, so the affair is technically an infidelity. But there's also context: the wife has anorexia and depression, making the situation complex. The man is described as unhappy and trying to leave, but hasn't yet.\n\nThe author might argue they're helping the man by being with him while he's stuck in a bad situation. But does that justify the affair? Even if the wife is struggling, the husband is still in a committed relationship. The affair could be seen as taking advantage of his emotional state. Also, the author is aware of the situation and chooses to stay involved despite knowing the complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they're providing support and companionship that the husband isn't getting in his marriage. However, the key point is that the husband is still married. Until he officially leaves, the relationship is adulterous. The author's role in encouraging him to leave sooner could be a factor too, but they also say they're not rushing him.\n\nMoral judgments often depend on cultural or religious views. Some might say the author is enabling the man to delay his decision, while others see it as a natural outcome given the unhappy marriage. But legally and traditionally, being in a relationship with someone still married is considered a betrayal of the marriage vows.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) because the author is engaged in an affair. However, the complexities might make some people argue the other way. But generally, the consensus might be that the author is in the wrong because the man is still married, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
