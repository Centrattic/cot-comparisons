He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for being in a secret relationship with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. The man is unhappy, has tried to get help for his wife, and is waiting for the right time to leave because of their child.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the man is still married when they started the affair. Even if he's planning to leave, as long as they're married, he's in a committed relationship. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it breaks trust and can hurt others. The author is involved in an affair, which is a breach of the man's marriage vows and potentially harms his wife and child. \n\nThe man's situation is complicated due to his wife's illness. But that doesn't necessarily excuse the affair. The author is aware of his marital status and the challenges he's facing. They support him in leaving but are still in a relationship while he's technically married. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship before he has officially separated. \n\nSome might argue that if he's planning to leave, the affair is justified, but ethically, most people would say that until he actually leaves, the marriage is still valid, and engaging in an affair is wrong. The author's role in encouraging him to leave soon might add to the complexity, but the act of being in a relationship with a married person is typically seen as the person's fault regardless of the circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are participating in an affair with someone who is still married, even if there are extenuating circumstances. The focus is on the marital status and the ethical implications of cheating.\n"
