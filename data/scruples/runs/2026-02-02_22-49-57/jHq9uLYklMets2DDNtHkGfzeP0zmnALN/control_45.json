He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a secret relationship with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet.\n\nFirst, I know that cheating is generally considered morally wrong because it violates the trust and commitment in a marriage. The man is still married, so any relationship outside of that marriage is adultery. The wife has anorexia and other issues, but that doesn't make the affair right. The man is trying to leave, but he hasn't done so yet. The author is aware of his marital status and the complexities but is still in the relationship. \n\nEven though the man's wife has challenges, the author's actions are still a betrayal of the marriage. The author might feel that the husband is unhappy and trying to do the right thing eventually, but the act of being in a relationship while still married is wrong. The author might be justifying it by the husband's intentions, but intentions don't make the action right. \n\nAlso, the author is part of a workplace relationship, which adds another layer of complexity, especially if they're in the same company. But the main issue here is the marital status. So, the author is in a morally wrong situation by engaging in an affair with a married person, regardless of the husband's circumstances. The fact that the husband hasn't left yet means the marriage is still valid, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
