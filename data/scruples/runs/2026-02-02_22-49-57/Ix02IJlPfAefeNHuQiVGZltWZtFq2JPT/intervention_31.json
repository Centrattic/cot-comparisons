I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who yelled at the preschool for doing a fire drill on their 3-year-old is in the wrong. The situation involves a recent house fire, and the child was sent back to school two days later. The school decided to do a fire drill without warning the parents, which caused the child to panic because his family didn't come out during the drill. The parent got angry and confronted the director.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The child had just been through a traumatic experience with the house fire. The parent was trying to maintain normalcy by continuing the pre-K routine. The fire drill, done without prior communication, could have been extremely distressing for the child. The parent had informed the school about the situation, so the school should have been aware of the child's vulnerability. The fact that the drill was on the calendar is mentioned, but the parent wasn't notified when dropping off the child, which is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, schools often conduct fire drills as part of safety protocols. The director might have followed standard procedures without considering the specific circumstances of this child. However, when a parent has communicated that their child has recently experienced a traumatic event, the school should take extra precautions. It's reasonable to expect that the school would either reschedule the drill or at least inform the parent to prepare the child.\n\nThe parent's reaction was intense, but given the context\u2014protecting their child from unnecessary trauma\u2014it might be understandable. The school's failure to communicate adequately contributed to the situation. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The school probably had procedures in place, but they didn't account for the child's specific needs. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
