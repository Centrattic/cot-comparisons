I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent being upset with their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill without informing them, especially after the family had a house fire.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parent's son just had a fire incident, and they wanted to keep things normal. They informed the school about the fire, but when they dropped off their son, the school decided to do a fire drill without any prior notice. The child was upset because during the drill, his family didn't come to get him, which they didn't expect. The parent was angry and confronted the director, who said the fire drill was on the calendar and didn't consider the child's situation.\n\nSo, the parent argues that the school should have known not to do a fire drill immediately after the family's traumatic experience. The school's response seems dismissive, using the calendar as an excuse without considering the child's well-being.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The parent's reaction is understandable given the recent trauma. The school, on the other hand, followed the calendar and didn't communicate the drill to the parent despite being informed of the situation. The director didn't check if the parent was okay with the fire drill, which could be a breach of communication and empathy.\n\nThe parent's anger stems from the school's failure to acknowledge their specific circumstances. Even though the fire drill was planned, the school didn't make an exception or inform the parent that it was happening that day. The child's mental capacity at 3 isn't developed enough to understand simulated emergencies, especially so soon after a real one. \n\nThe parent's actions were to drop off the child and then get a call that the child was upset. The parent's reaction to the director's dismissiveness was justified because the school didn't show sensitivity. The director's excuse about the calendar doesn't hold when there's a clear situation that requires individual consideration. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The school failed to communicate and consider the child's well-being post-trauma. The parent's anger is a result of the school's negligence in handling the situation properly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
