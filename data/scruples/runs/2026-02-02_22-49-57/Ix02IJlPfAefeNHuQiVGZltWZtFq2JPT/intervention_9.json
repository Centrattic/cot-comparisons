I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for getting angry at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The family just went through a house fire, and they were trying to maintain normalcy for their children. The son was excited to go to school, and the parents had informed the school about the situation. The school then conducted a fire drill without warning, which caused the child to panic because his family wasn't there. The director's reasoning was that the drill was on the calendar, implying that it was a scheduled event, and they didn't consider the child's recent trauma.\n\nThe key points here are: the child was only 3 years old, the family was in the middle of a crisis, the parents had communicated the situation to the school, and the school didn't adjust the drill despite knowing the child's circumstances. The author's reaction was anger towards the school for not being more considerate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. \n\nI need to evaluate the school's actions. The school had a calendar with the fire drill listed, but the parents didn't check it because they were preoccupied. However, the school should have made exceptions given the child's situation. The director's response of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive and doesn't take into account the child's emotional state post-fire. \n\nThe author's anger is a reaction to the school's negligence in not accommodating a child who was already stressed from a traumatic event. The school's responsibility is to look out for the well-being of the children, especially those with specific needs. By not informing the parents about the drill despite being aware of the situation, the school failed in their duty of care. \n\nTherefore, the author is justified in their anger. The school's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's reaction is a response to that negligence. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
