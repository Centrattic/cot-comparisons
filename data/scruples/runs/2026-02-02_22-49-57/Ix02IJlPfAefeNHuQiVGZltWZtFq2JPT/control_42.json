I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's 3-year-old had a fire drill at preschool right after their house fire. The kid was upset because he was separated from the family, and the school didn't inform the parents beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The school's perspective: they might have a policy of doing fire drills regularly to prepare kids. They had a calendar with the drills listed, and maybe they follow a schedule regardless of individual circumstances. They might not have realized the significance of the fire drill in this specific case, especially since the family had just gone through a real fire. Also, the parent mentioned they had just moved back in and were trying to keep things normal for the kids, so the school might not have known the full context beyond being told the house fire happened.\n\nOn the parent's side, they were dealing with a traumatic event. The kid was already dealing with the aftermath, and the fire drill could have triggered more fear or anxiety. The parent was trying to maintain some normalcy but was upset that the school didn't consider their situation. The parent called the school beforehand, but the staff didn't check in again, and when the drill happened, it caused the child distress. The parent's anger is understandable because they might feel the school wasn't sensitive to their child's needs.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent was wrong to be upset and confront the director. The parent did inform the school about the fire, but maybe the school didn't adjust the routine. However, the school's response was to say it was on the calendar, which seems dismissive. The parent's outburst was because of the child's distress, which is a valid concern. The school might have a duty to be more flexible in such a sensitive situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school might be at fault for not accommodating the child's trauma, while the parent's reaction could be seen as justified given the circumstances. The parent was trying to protect their child, so their reaction makes sense. However, the parent could have approached the situation more calmly, but the director's lack of response to the parent's initial concern might have contributed to the parent's frustration.\n\nSo overall, the parent's anger is a reaction to the school's failure to consider their child's trauma and not providing adequate communication. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
