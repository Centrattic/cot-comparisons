I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the family had a house fire a couple of weeks before, which is a traumatic event. The parents wanted to keep things as normal as possible for their kids, so they continued sending their 3-year-old to pre-K. The mom called the school director to inform them about the situation. She dropped off her son and left, not checking the calendar that had the fire drill scheduled. The school decided to do a fire drill without checking if the child was ready, leading to the child being extremely upset when the drill happened and his family didn't come out. The mom got angry and confronted the director, who said it was on the calendar.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Let me consider the key points. The school had a fire drill scheduled, which is a standard practice to prepare children for emergencies. However, the child had recently experienced a real fire, which is a traumatic event. The school didn't seem to consider his specific situation when planning the drill. The mom had informed the school about the fire, so they should have been aware of the child's recent trauma. The director's justification was that the drill was on the calendar, but that doesn't seem to account for the child's emotional state. The school's responsibility is to the safety of all children, but they also have a duty to be sensitive to individual needs, especially after being informed about a traumatic event. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom did call to inform them, but she didn't check the calendar. However, the school should have reviewed the calendar and considered if the drill was appropriate given the child's situation. The mom's reaction was intense, but it was in response to the school's oversight. The school might have failed to communicate adequately, even though the calendar was there. \n\nSo, it seems like the school made a mistake by not considering the child's recent trauma despite being informed. The mom's anger is understandable given the circumstances. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
