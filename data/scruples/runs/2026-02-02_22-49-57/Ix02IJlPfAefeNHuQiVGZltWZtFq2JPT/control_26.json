I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parent's son was in a pre-K program. They had a house fire, and after that, they continued sending him to school to maintain some normalcy. The parent called the director to inform them about the fire, but when dropping off the kid, didn't check the calendar where the fire drill was listed. The school did a fire drill without warning the child, leading to him being upset because his family wasn't there. The director's reasoning was that the kid needed to get used to fire drills, and they mentioned it was on the calendar. The parent got angry and confronted the director, and now they're asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: The child is three years old. The school conducted a fire drill without informing the parents, despite the parent having mentioned the traumatic event. The school's defense was the calendar, but they didn't check if the parents were aware when dropping off the kid. The parent's reaction was emotional, but they question if it was justified.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the school's perspective, they might follow protocols like having fire drills and assuming parents check the calendar. However, given the specific circumstances of the child's recent trauma (house fire) and the parent informing them beforehand, the school should have been more considerate. They didn't mention the drill during drop-off, which was a communication failure. The parent was trying to keep things normal but the school's action added stress to the child.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable because the school didn't take into account the child's emotional state. However, the parent's approach was to \"rip them a new one,\" which was harsh. The school might have had procedures, but they should have made exceptions for a child recently through trauma. The parent could have communicated more effectively instead of reacting in anger. However, the school's responsibility to the child's well-being is also important here. They should have been more empathetic and adjusted their procedures given the parent's prior notification.\n\nIn conclusion, the school shares some responsibility for not adjusting the fire drill considering the child's situation and the parent's communication. The parent's reaction was based on valid concern for their child's well-being, but their method of addressing it was inappropriate. However, the main wrong lies with the school, so the parent isn't entirely at fault. Hence, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
