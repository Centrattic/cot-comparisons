I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) was wrong for getting angry at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident.\n\nFirst, the context: The child's family had a house fire two weeks before his 3rd birthday. They were displaced for six months. They decided to keep the child in pre-K for stability. The school did a fire drill without warning, causing the child distress because he didn't see his parents during the drill. The parent got upset and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar and they didn't think to mention it.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: After a traumatic event, maintaining routine is crucial for a child's sense of security. The parent had just informed the school about the fire and wanted to keep things normal. The school proceeded with a fire drill without informing the parent, leading to the child's distress. The parent's reaction was driven by the child's well-being and the traumatic context.\n\nThe school's responsibility is to ensure the safety and comfort of the children. Even if fire drills are standard, in this case, the school failed to consider the child's specific situation. They should have communicated the drill, especially given the parent's recent trauma. The director's response about the calendar being insufficient\u2014parents might not check it, especially in a crisis. Also, a 3-year-old's psychological capacity isn't equipped to handle such drills without parental reassurance.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable given the circumstances. They were already stressed from the fire, and the school's negligence added to their distress. While their reaction might have been harsh, the school's actions were inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. The school failed in their duty to communicate and accommodate the child's needs. The answer should be B.\n"
