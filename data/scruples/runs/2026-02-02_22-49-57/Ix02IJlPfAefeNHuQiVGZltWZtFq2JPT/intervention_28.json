I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The parent sent their 3-year-old to pre-K after a house fire. The school did a fire drill without warning the kid, which upset him because his family didn't come out. The parent got angry and confronted the director, who said it was on the calendar. The parent is now questioning if they were wrong to react that way.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The kid just turned 3 and was already traumatized by a house fire. The school decided to do a fire drill without informing the parents, even though the parent had mentioned the situation the night before. The director didn't mention the drill during drop-off, and the kid panicked because he didn't understand why the adults weren't there. The parent had to go back to get him, and they were upset about the school's handling of it.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions. They were already stressed from the fire, trying to maintain normalcy for their kids. The school's decision to do the drill without considering the child's emotional state seems negligent. The director's response of \"it was on the calendar\" doesn't account for the specific circumstances the child was in. The parent's anger is understandable given the situation. They had warned the school, so they might expect some consideration. The director didn't check in or adjust the drill, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut maybe there's a standard procedure for fire drills in schools, and they have to do them regardless. However, with a 3-year-old who's just been through a trauma, maybe the school should have made exceptions. The parent's reaction was harsh, but maybe justified. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for being upset and confronting the director. The parent's main issue is that the school didn't communicate or consider the child's well-being. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school has a duty of care. If they knew the child's situation, they should have been more cautious. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's failure, not just the drill itself. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
