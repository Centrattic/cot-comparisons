I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation fully. The family had a house fire, which is a traumatic event. They wanted to maintain normalcy for their 3-year-old by continuing his pre-K. The school conducted a fire drill without prior notice, leading to the child's distress. The mother was angry because the school didn't inform her despite her mentioning the family's situation.\n\nThe key points here are the school's responsibility. Fire drills are standard, but at a pre-K level, especially with 3-year-olds, communication with parents is crucial. The mother had informed the school about the fire, so it's reasonable to expect that the staff would take precautions. Not informing her about the drill, even if it's on the calendar, is a lapse in communication. The child's age is a factor; a 3-year-old might not understand the purpose of a fire drill and could become frightened if not properly prepared or comforted.\n\nThe mother's reaction was emotional, but given the traumatic context, her anger is understandable. The school's defense about the calendar being a notice doesn't address the specific needs of a child recently through a real fire. The school should have made exceptions or informed parents of the drill, especially in such sensitive circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, the school's actions were negligent in their duty to communicate and care for the child's emotional well-being. The mother's response, while perhaps harsh, stems from a desire to protect her child and ensure the school understands the gravity of their mistake. Therefore, the mother isn't in the wrong.\n"
