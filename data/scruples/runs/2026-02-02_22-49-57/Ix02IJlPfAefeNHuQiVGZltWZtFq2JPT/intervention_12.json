I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting angry at their child's preschool after a fire drill during a stressful time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent's three-year-old had just gone through a house fire and was displaced for months. They wanted to keep things normal for the kids, so they resumed the pre-K program. The parent informed the school director about the fire and the situation. When dropping the kid off, they met with the teacher but didn't check the calendar. Later, the school did a fire drill without warning, causing the child to panic because he thought his family was trapped. The parent got angry, especially because the director said it was on the calendar and didn't mention it when dropping off.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: the child was very young and had just experienced a traumatic event. The parent had informed the school about the situation, so they might expect the school to be considerate. Fire drills for a 3-year-old without explanation could be traumatic, especially when the child is already stressed. The school's failure to communicate the drill and their dismissive response (\"it was on the calendar\") seems negligent. The parent's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the school might argue that fire drills are standard procedure and that the calendar was a public notice. However, the parent had specifically informed the school about the traumatic event, so there's an expectation that the school would make accommodations. The fact that no one mentioned the drill when the parent dropped the child off is a key point. The school failed to communicate properly, which contributed to the parent's frustration.\n\nLegally and ethically, schools have a duty of care. For young children, fire drills need to be handled with care, explaining them in age-appropriate terms. If the school didn't do that and caused unnecessary distress, especially to a child in a vulnerable situation, the school is at fault. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's failure to protect their child and to communicate effectively. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
