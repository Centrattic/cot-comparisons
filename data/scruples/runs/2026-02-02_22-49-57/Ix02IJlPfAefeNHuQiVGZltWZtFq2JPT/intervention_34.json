I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong for getting angry at the pre-K school after a fire drill incident. The situation involves a child who had just experienced a house fire and was then subjected to a fire drill without warning.\n\nFirst, the parent's context is crucial. Their son had a traumatic experience with a house fire, leading to displacement and significant stress for the family. They were trying to maintain normalcy by continuing the child's pre-K routine. The parent communicated with the school about the situation before dropping the child off. However, the school proceeded with a fire drill without informing the parent or the child, which caused the child to panic when he didn't understand why his parents didn't come immediately.\n\nThe school's defense was that the fire drill was on the calendar and that the teacher didn't mention it because they thought the parent didn't need to know. But the parent argues that the child, being only 3 years old, couldn't comprehend a fire drill, especially after his recent trauma. The parent's anger seems justified given the circumstances. The school's failure to consider the child's emotional state and trauma history is a key point here. \n\nThe parent's reaction, while perhaps intense, was in response to negligence. The school didn't take into account the specific needs of a child who had just been through a traumatic event. It's reasonable for the parent to be upset that the school proceeded with the drill without any warning or consideration. \n\nAdditionally, the parent had already communicated the situation to the teacher, making the school aware of the potential sensitivity around fire drills. The fact that the school didn't address this in their planning shows a lack of empathy and proper care. \n\nIn summary, the parent's anger stems from the school's failure to accommodate a child's trauma history, which is a valid concern. The parent isn't in the wrong for reacting strongly to this oversight.\n"
