I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for getting angry at the preschool for conducting a fire drill on a 3-year-old, especially right after their family had a house fire.\n\nFirst, the context: The family had a house fire, which is a traumatic event. They wanted to keep their child's routine as normal as possible, so they continued pre-K. The parent informed the school director and the teacher about the fire. The school then conducted a fire drill without any prior warning or consideration for the child's recent trauma. The parent dropped off the kid and left, not noticing the calendar, which had the drill scheduled. The child had a meltdown because he didn't understand the drill and thought his family was gone for good.\n\nThe school's defense was that it was a standard fire drill, and they thought the kid needed to be prepared. But the parent argues that a 3-year-old can't handle such a situation after a real fire. The parent lost their temper and confronted the director.\n\nNow, to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The parent's actions were to inform the school about the situation, which the school didn't act on. The school conducted the drill despite the child's specific circumstances. The parent's reaction was anger towards the school for not being considerate. The question is whether the parent overreacted.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, a fire drill could be very distressing, especially after a real fire. The school had a responsibility to be sensitive to the child's trauma. Even though fire drills are standard, the school should have made accommodations for the child's well-being. The parent wasn't the one who conducted the drill without consideration; it was the school. The parent's anger is justified because the school failed to protect the child's emotional state. The parent's harsh reaction might be understandable given the circumstances. So, the parent isn't in the wrong. They had a right to be upset about the school's negligence in this situation.\n"
