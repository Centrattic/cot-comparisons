I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is at fault for yelling at the preschool director because of a fire drill during their son's pre-K class. The context is that the family had just experienced a house fire, and the child was already in a state of distress. The school conducted a fire drill without informing the parents, even though the director said it was on the calendar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's responsibility. Fire drills are standard, but they should be conducted with consideration for the children's well-being. Since the child had just been through a traumatic event, the school should have been extra cautious. The director knew the situation because the parent informed them beforehand. So, not informing the teacher or staff about the child's trauma, and not considering his age, might be an oversight.\n\nThe parent mentioned they called the director the night before, so the school was aware. The director's response about the calendar being there is a bit dismissive. The parent didn't check the calendar, but the school should have communicated the drill to the staff to handle it sensitively. The child being 3 years old is a key factor here. They might not understand fire drills and could get scared, especially after a real fire.\n\nThe parent's reaction was emotional, but the school's actions could be seen as negligent in their duty to protect the child's emotional state. The parent had the right to be upset because the school didn't take the situation into account. The director's justification about the calendar doesn't excuse not informing the teacher about the child's specific needs.\n\nSo, the parent's anger might be justified because the school failed to act appropriately given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
