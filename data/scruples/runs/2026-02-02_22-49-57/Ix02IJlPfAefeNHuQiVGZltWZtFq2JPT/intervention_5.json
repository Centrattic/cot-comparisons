I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at their son's preschool after a fire drill when the kid had just been through a house fire.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The child was in a pre-K program that did a fire drill without warning. The family had a house fire recently, so the kid was already traumatized. The parent called the school to inform them about the fire and that they were sending the kid to school to maintain normalcy. They dropped him off, but the teacher didn't mention the fire drill. The school did the drill, and the kid freaked out because he didn't understand why his family wasn't coming out. The parent gets upset and yells at the director.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: They were already under stress, dealing with the aftermath of a fire. They wanted to give their child a sense of normalcy and safety. The school didn't inform them about the fire drill despite being told about the child's recent trauma. The parent felt the school was insensitive and didn't take their situation into account. The director's response about the calendar being public seems dismissive, as they didn't check in with the parent or the child's needs.\n\nFrom the school's side, maybe they have standard procedures for fire drills, thinking they need to prepare kids for emergencies. But in this case, the child had a real fire experience, so the drill could have triggered him. The school didn't make an exception or communicate properly. The director's reliance on the calendar without considering the parent's explanation shows a lack of empathy.\n\nThe parent's reaction was anger, which they admit was harsh. However, given the circumstances, their frustration is understandable. The school failed to accommodate a known trauma situation. The parent's main issue was that the school didn't adjust their procedures for the child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school should have known about the child's situation and adjusted accordingly. The parent followed through by informing the school and expected that the school would handle the child's needs. The school's failure to do so led to the child's distress, which the parent found unacceptable. So, the parent's anger is a reaction to the school's negligence rather than their own wrongdoing. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
