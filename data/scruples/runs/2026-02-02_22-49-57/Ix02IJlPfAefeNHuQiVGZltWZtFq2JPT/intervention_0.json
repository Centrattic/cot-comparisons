I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 3-year-old child who recently went through a house fire and then the school did a fire drill without warning, causing the child to panic. The parent got angry and confronted the school director.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parent had just gone through a traumatic event and wanted to maintain some normalcy for their child. They informed the school about the situation and even met with the teacher. The school decided to do a fire drill without checking in with the parent or the child's specific needs. The parent was upset because the drill wasn't communicated, even though it was on the calendar. The director's response was that it's part of the routine, but they didn't consider the child's trauma.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: they were already stressed from the fire, and the school's decision to do a sudden drill without considering the child's emotional state seems negligent. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's failure to accommodate their child's needs. The director didn't mention the drill during drop-off, even though the parent had informed them about the recent trauma. The calendar being public doesn't excuse the lack of communication with the parent.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, schools should be sensitive to a child's individual circumstances. The child was only 3, which is a very young age to handle such drills. The school's approach seems rigid without empathy. The parent's outburst, while maybe harsh, was a reaction to the school's oversight. They had a right to be upset about the lack of communication and consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, the school might argue that fire drills are standard procedure. However, in this case, the parent had specifically informed them of the child's recent trauma, which should have been a reason to adjust the approach. The school's failure to do so could be seen as negligence in their duty of care.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong because the school didn't take necessary precautions. Their reaction is understandable given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
