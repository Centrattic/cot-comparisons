I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who was upset with their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill without warning, especially after their family had a house fire. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parent's son recently turned 3 and was in a pre-K program. They had a house fire two days before sending him to school, and the school did a fire drill an hour after dropping him off. The parent was upset because the child got scared and didn't understand why his family didn't come out during the drill. The school director said it was on the calendar, but didn't mention it when the parent dropped off the kid.\n\nThe parent called the director out, and now they're asking if they were in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nSo, what's important here is the school's responsibility. Fire drills are part of safety protocols, but they should consider the individual circumstances of the students. The child was 3, had just experienced a traumatic event, and the school didn't check in with the parent about the situation. The parent did inform the school about the fire, so the school should have been aware of the child's vulnerability. \n\nThe school's failure to communicate or adjust the drill in light of the recent trauma could be a problem. The parent's reaction was driven by concern for their child's well-being. The director's response about the calendar being insufficient because they didn't mention the situation to the parent when they dropped off the child suggests a lack of attention to the specific needs here.\n\nHowever, the parent might have handled it differently. Maybe they could have asked more questions or ensured the school was aware of the child's recent trauma before the drill. But the school had an obligation to consider the child's situation and adjust accordingly. The parent's anger stems from the school not doing that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school likely shares some blame for not accommodating the child's situation. The parent's outburst might have been harsh, but their reaction is understandable given the circumstances. The school's failure to communicate properly and consider the child's well-being could make them at fault. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
