I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the parent (the author) was in the wrong when they yelled at their child's preschool teacher for conducting a fire drill without informing them, especially after their family had just gone through a house fire.\n\nFirst, the context is crucial. The family had a house fire, which is extremely traumatic for anyone, especially small children. The parent wanted to keep things normal for their kids, so they continued sending the 3-year-old to pre-K. That makes sense because stability is important after such an event.\n\nNow, the school decided to do a fire drill. While fire drills are standard practice to ensure safety, the timing here is questionable. The parent had already informed the school about the fire and the child's situation. The school didn't mention the fire drill when the parent dropped off the child, which is a problem. The parent had specifically asked if everyone knew the situation, and the director didn't respond. That lack of communication is a red flag.\n\nThe child was three years old and had just experienced a real fire. Subjecting them to a fire drill without any preparation or warning could be retraumatizing. The school's reasoning that \"it was on the calendar\" is weak because the parent didn't check the calendar, which is understandable given the chaos they were in. The school should have made a special accommodation in this case, especially after being informed of the child's recent trauma.\n\nThe parent's reaction was emotional, but considering the circumstances, it's hard to blame them. They were already under a lot of stress, and the school's negligence in communication and empathy contributed to the parent losing their temper. The school's approach was impersonal and didn't take into account the child's well-being post-trauma.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the parent's outburst was a result of the school's failure to communicate and consider the child's situation. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
