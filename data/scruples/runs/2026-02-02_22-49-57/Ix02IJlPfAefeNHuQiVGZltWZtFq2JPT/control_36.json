I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 3-year-old child's pre-K school doing a fire drill without prior notice to the parents, who had recently experienced a house fire. The parent got angry and confronted the school director.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The child is very young, only 3 years old. The family had a traumatic experience with a house fire, which must have been stressful for everyone, especially the kids. The parents wanted to keep their routine as normal as possible, so they continued sending the child to pre-K. However, the school decided to do a fire drill without informing the parents, leading to the child's distress because he thought his family didn't come back during the drill.\n\nThe parent called the director beforehand to inform them about the fire, so the school was aware of the situation. The director claims the drill was on the calendar, but the parent didn't check it. However, the parent was in the process of getting their family settled after the fire, with many tasks to handle, so maybe not checking the calendar is understandable. Also, when dropping off the child, the staff didn't mention the drill, which is a problem because they should have communicated it.\n\nThe school's reasoning was that the child needs to get used to fire drills, but a 3-year-old might not comprehend the situation, especially after a recent traumatic event. The director's response that it was on the calendar doesn't take into account the parent's context. The parent's anger is justified because the school didn't consider the child's emotional state and failed to communicate properly. The parent did inform the school about the recent trauma, so the staff should have been more sensitive and made accommodations.\n\nIn terms of fault, the school seems to have a bigger responsibility here. They didn't communicate the drill to the parents, despite knowing the child's recent experience. The parent's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to the school's negligence. The parent was trying to protect their child and ensure their well-being, which is a parent's duty. The school's failure to adjust their procedures in light of the child's specific circumstances is the main issue here. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong because the school didn't handle the situation appropriately.\n"
