I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent was wrong for getting angry at the pre-K school after a fire drill.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kid just had a house fire, which is a traumatic event. The parents sent him to school to keep things normal. The school did a fire drill without warning the parent or the child. The child freaked out because he was scared and didn't understand why his family wasn't there. The director said it was on the calendar, but they didn't inform the parent when dropping off. The parent got angry and confronted the director.\n\nNow, considering the context. The child is three years old, which is very young. After a traumatic event, the child's emotional needs are critical. The school's decision to do a fire drill without any notice or consideration for the child's recent trauma seems insensitive. Even if fire drills are routine, the school should have made exceptions for a child in a vulnerable state. The parent informed the school about the situation the night before, so they should have known the child was dealing with trauma. Failing to adjust the drill's approach shows negligence in their duty of care.\n\nThe parent's anger is a reaction to the school's negligence. While the parent might have been harsh, the provocation was significant. The school's response of just pointing to the calendar without acknowledging the child's specific circumstances is irresponsible. The parent's main issue was the lack of communication and consideration for their child's well-being.\n\nSo, the parent isn't at fault here. The school made the mistake, and the parent's reaction, though maybe strong, is understandable given the circumstances. Answer B.\n"
