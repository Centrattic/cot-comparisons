I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post was in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill. \n\nFirst, the context: The family had a house fire, were displaced for six months, and wanted to keep their son's routine as normal as possible. They continued sending him to pre-K. The mother informed the school about the fire, but when she dropped him off, she didn't check the calendar, which had a fire drill scheduled. The school conducted the drill without informing her, leading to her son's distress.\n\nThe key points here are the child's age (3 years old) and the traumatic event the family experienced. The school's defense was that the fire drill was on the calendar, implying it was a routine activity. However, the mother felt they didn't consider the recent trauma. \n\nFrom a parent's perspective, ensuring the child's emotional safety is crucial, especially after a traumatic event. The school's decision to proceed with the drill without making exceptions for the child's current situation might be seen as insensitive. The mother's reaction, while harsh, could stem from protecting her child. \n\nThe school's responsibility is to the well-being of the children. If a child is known to be in a state of stress due to a recent trauma, it might be reasonable to adjust activities to avoid additional distress. The school's failure to communicate the fire drill despite the mother informing them about the fire could be a misstep. \n\nThe mother's anger is understandable given the circumstances. She was already under stress from the fire, dealing with insurance, etc., and the additional stress of her son being upset could push her to act out. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school might share some blame for not accommodating the child's needs after being informed of the situation. The mother's approach was confrontational, but her intent was to protect her child. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The school's actions were arguably insensitive, and the mother's response, though harsh, was driven by protecting her child's well-being after trauma.\n"
