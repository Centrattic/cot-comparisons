It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered pizza because they were starving and offered it to their girlfriend. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found she had removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to get so upset.\n\nSo, where's the issue here? The main points are communication and expectations. The girlfriend said she would have some of the pizza, but maybe she expected leftovers or thought she could use it for something else later. The author assumed she would eat it as is. When she took toppings off all the pieces, he felt she was being inconsiderate because he wanted to eat the pizza as ordered. \n\nBut wait, maybe she was just trying to save money? The pizza is expensive, so taking toppings off might have been her way of stretching the food. However, the author paid for it, so there's a conflict between ownership and sharing. Did he communicate that he wanted to eat the pizza, not just have leftovers? \n\nAlso, the girlfriend didn't take entire pieces, just the toppings and cheese. She said she didn't take all of it. The author might be overreacting because he was already in a bad mood from being hungry. But is his anger justified? If he had communicated that he wanted to eat the pizza immediately, maybe she wouldn't have done that. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have considered that the author wanted to eat the pizza as it was. She might have thought it was okay to modify it since he had already taken his pieces. But modifying every piece could be seen as taking more than her share indirectly. \n\nSo, both parties might have miscommunicated. The author didn't clarify that he wanted her to eat the pizza as is, and the girlfriend didn't consider that modifying the pizza might affect his meal. The argument happened because of these unspoken expectations. \n\nIn such cases, the key is whether the reaction was proportional. The author got angry and called her selfish, leading to a big argument. The girlfriend felt she was just being practical. The author's anger might be a bit over the top, but maybe not entirely wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. \n\nConsidering the scenario, the author's reaction was based on his unexpressed expectation that the pizza was for eating as ordered. The girlfriend didn't meet that expectation, but maybe the author should have been clearer. However, the girlfriend's actions did interfere with the author's meal. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author wasn't in the wrong for being upset about his meal being altered without discussion. But there's room for both to be at fault. However, the question is specifically about the author. Since the girlfriend didn't communicate her intent to modify the pizza, and the author had a right to expect the pizza to be as ordered for his consumption, the author's reaction, while perhaps intense, isn't entirely wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
