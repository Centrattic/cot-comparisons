It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering an expensive pizza, eating two slices, and then finding out his girlfriend took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The pizza was from a specific, pricier place, and the author was really craving it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but would have some of what he gets. Then he orders it, eats two slices, and later finds out she took toppings off all the pieces. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she would take toppings off one or two slices, but she did it to all. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. But he went from being hungry to angry, calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a bigger argument. \n\nIs his reaction justified? Well, he paid for the pizza, was looking forward to it, and now the pizza isn't as he expected. Maybe he felt disrespected. However, she didn't take the pizza from him; she modified what was left. She might have thought it was fine since he had already eaten some. But the author's frustration is understandable because the pizza's quality affected his meal. \n\nThen there's the argument part. He called her names, and she called him childish. Both escalated the situation. The question is whether he was wrong. If he overreacted, then maybe A. If his feelings were valid, then B. \n\nBut considering that the pizza was important to him, and her actions (though maybe not malicious) affected his experience, his anger might be justified. However, the way he expressed it (calling her selfish, leading to a big argument) could be seen as overreacting. But the user's question is if he's in the wrong. Since the focus is on her taking toppings off all pieces and the author's reaction, the answer might hinge on whether his response was disproportionate.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe they should have discussed the pizza plan better. The author could have asked if she wanted her own pizza, but he assumed she didn't. She might not have realized he wanted the pizza in a certain way. However, the act of taking toppings off all slices could be seen as selfish, especially if he was the one who ordered and paid for it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's anger might not be entirely unfounded, but his reaction could have been more measured. But since the user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, I might lean towards B. However, some might think the author overreacted. But the key is that the girlfriend modified the food he paid for without considering his preference. That's a valid point. So the answer might be B.\n"
