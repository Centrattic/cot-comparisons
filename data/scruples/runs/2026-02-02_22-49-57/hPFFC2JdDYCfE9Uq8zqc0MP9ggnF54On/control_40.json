It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So the situation is that the girlfriend wanted to eat some of the toppings, and the author thought she meant taking off a little from one or two pieces. But she actually took toppings and cheese off every piece, which made him angry. They argued, and he called her selfish, while she said he was overreacting.\n\nHmm, first, the author ordered pizza for himself and offered the girlfriend to have some. She said she would just have some toppings, which he interpreted as taking a bit from a couple of slices. But she ended up removing toppings from all the pieces. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have expected her to take a small amount, but she did the opposite. The girlfriend's action could be seen as inconsiderate because she modified all the pizza, making it less enjoyable for the author. However, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and start a big argument. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Did he overreact? The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of what she was doing. She could have thought sharing the toppings was okay, but maybe she didn't consider that removing everything would leave the author with a subpar meal. On the other hand, the author could have handled the situation better. Instead of getting angry right away, maybe he should have asked for clarification when he noticed the problem. But the act of taking toppings off all slices without asking might be the main issue here. The girlfriend's actions were perhaps disrespectful of the author's order and his preference. The author's frustration is understandable, but escalating it to a fight might not be the best approach. However, the initial action of the girlfriend might have been the trigger. So is the author in the wrong? He did start the fight, but maybe her actions warranted it. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author immediately reacted with anger and called her names without discussing, that's his fault. But if the girlfriend's behavior was indeed selfish and she didn't consider his feelings, then maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Since it's just pizza, getting angry and starting an argument might be over the top, but the girlfriend's actions were also questionable. I'm leaning towards the author being in the right to be upset, but maybe not in how he handled it. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the main issue is that he started the fight, but the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, it's a bit both. But the options are A or B. Since the author's anger might not be entirely out of line, but his approach was harsh, maybe the answer is A because he started the fight. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions might be the root cause, so the author's reaction could be justified. But the way he called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument, might be his part in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe both are at fault. The options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no (author not wrong). The question is about who is in the wrong. The author's anger might be reasonable, but escalating into a fight is not. So the answer could be A. But the girlfriend's actions were the main problem. The question is about the author's role in the fight. Starting a fight over this might make the author wrong. So answer A.\n"
