It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a specific pizza they were craving, the girlfriend saying she would take some toppings from whatever he gets, and then later she ends up taking toppings off all the pieces, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear about ordering pizza they were hungry for. The girlfriend said she would take some toppings, which the author assumed meant taking a few pieces or parts. However, she ended up modifying all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nThe author might argue that the girlfriend didn't clarify her intention to take toppings off all the pieces, which could lead to misunderstandings. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since he ordered the pizza, she was entitled to take what she wanted, especially since he had already taken two pieces. The argument escalated when the author called her selfish, which might be seen as overreacting, but the situation also led to her being defensive and bringing up other issues.\n\nI should consider whether the author's anger was justified. The author was hungry and had a specific craving, and the pizza was more expensive. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pieces could be seen as taking more than her share, especially since she had initially said she would just have some of whatever he got. However, the author might have expected that taking toppings would be minimal and not affect the entire order.\n\nAnother angle is the communication breakdown. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched, and the girlfriend didn't ask for permission. But since the author was the one who ordered the pizza, he might have a right to expect it to remain as ordered, especially since he was the one paying for it. The girlfriend's action could be seen as taking without considering his preference, which led to the author feeling disrespected.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the author overreacted by calling her selfish without understanding her reasoning. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay because he had already taken his pieces and the pizza was there for her to use. The argument could have been resolved with better communication rather than escalating.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's anger might be justified if he felt his needs were not considered. The value of the pizza and the effort to order it could add to the frustration. But the girlfriend's actions, while inconsiderate, might not be malicious. The key issue is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Yelling and calling her selfish could be seen as harsh, but the root of the problem is the lack of clear communication about sharing the pizza.\n\nOverall, the main factors are the expectations around shared purchases, communication, and the appropriateness of the reaction. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling upset, but the way the conflict was handled could be improved. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't realize the impact of her actions. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that both parties could have communicated better.\n"
