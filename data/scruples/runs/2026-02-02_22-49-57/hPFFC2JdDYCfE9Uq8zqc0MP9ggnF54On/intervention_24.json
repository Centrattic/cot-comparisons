It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for getting angry over their girlfriend taking toppings off every pizza piece. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever they got. So, the author ordered it, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and then came back not eating. When confronted, she explained she took toppings off the pizza, which the author found inconsiderate. The author got angry, called her selfish, and the argument escalated.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's reasoning is that the girlfriend promised to take some of the pizza but instead took toppings off all the pieces, leaving the author with less. The author felt this was selfish, especially since they had paid for the pizza. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought it was okay because the author had already eaten their pieces and didn't take all the cheese. \n\nI need to determine if the author's reaction is justified. The girlfriend did take from the shared pizza without clearly communicating her intentions. The author might have expected her to either take a piece or leave the pizza as is. However, the girlfriend altered it in a way that affected the author's remaining portions. \n\nThe author's frustration could stem from feeling that their request was not respected. The girlfriend didn't just take a portion but modified all the pieces, which could be seen as not considering the author's craving. The argument escalated because the author felt disrespected, and the girlfriend found the reaction overblown. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's possible that the author should have considered that sharing a pizza might involve some compromise. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece might be more inconsiderate than just taking a slice. The author's emotional reaction is understandable if they were really craving the specific pizza. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated better. If they noticed the girlfriend wasn't eating, perhaps they could have offered a specific piece or checked in again. But the girlfriend's action was unexpected and might have been a way for her to get some of the toppings without the crust. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author ordered the pizza, paid for it, and had a specific craving. The girlfriend, while allowed to partake, modified the pizza in a way that affected the author's enjoyment. The argument about selfishness might be valid from the author's perspective. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's anger is based on the girlfriend's action affecting their personal experience with the pizza. The girlfriend's defense that the author already had their pieces might not account for the author's specific craving. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about this perceived selfishness.\n"
