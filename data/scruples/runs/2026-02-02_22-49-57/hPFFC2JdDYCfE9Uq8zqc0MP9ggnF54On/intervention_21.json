It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation. \n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. So the author ordered, ate two slices, and then later found out the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that when the girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got, she meant she'd eat slices directly from the pizza. However, the girlfriend interpreted it as taking toppings off, which the author found inconsiderate. \n\nThe girlfriend didn't communicate her intention to take toppings off the pizza before eating them. The author, on the other hand, didn't specify that he wanted the pizza as is, without modifications. The argument escalated because both had different expectations. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling that the girlfriend was selfish for modifying all the pizza without asking. But the girlfriend might see it as her way of eating the pizza without making the author uncomfortable about her preferences. However, since she didn't take any whole slices, maybe she thought it was acceptable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he ordered the pizza for himself, assuming it would be shared as whole slices. The girlfriend's actions altered the pizza in a way that affected the author's experience. The author's frustration is about the modification of the food they both ordered. Since the girlfriend didn't ask or communicate her plan, the author's reaction is about being considered inconsiderate. \n\nBut maybe the author could have clarified his expectations earlier. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces seems excessive and not considerate of the author's desire to eat the pizza as ordered. The argument is about differing expectations and lack of communication. \n\nIn conclusion, while both could have communicated better, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong to be upset. The answer is B.\n"
