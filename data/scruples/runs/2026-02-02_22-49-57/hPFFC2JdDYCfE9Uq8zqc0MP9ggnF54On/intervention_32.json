It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of what they got. Then the author ordered, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they were really craving this pizza, which is a bit expensive but worth it. They ordered it, and the girlfriend said she would have some of it. The author might have expected that they would share the pizza, maybe even split it. But when the author saw that the girlfriend had taken toppings off all the pieces, they got upset. The author felt that the girlfriend was being selfish and inconsiderate, not thinking about the author's desire for the pizza as it was.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought she took toppings off one or two pieces, but she actually took from all. She might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted without considering that the author would be left with less appealing slices. She also said the author was being a child and blowing things out of proportion. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author ordered the pizza, but the girlfriend agreed to have some of it. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pieces might be seen as not considering the author's enjoyment of the pizza. However, the author also assumed that the girlfriend would take only a little, and maybe didn't consider that the girlfriend might not want to eat the pizza at all, or take more than expected. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger and calling the girlfriend selfish. But is that justified? It's possible that the girlfriend didn't realize the impact of her actions, or maybe she thought it was okay to take what she wanted. The author's anger might be over a relatively small issue, but from their perspective, they had to pay more for the pizza and were craving it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered that the girlfriend might not like the pizza and that she has the right to take what she wants. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pieces might have been excessive, leaving the author with a less enjoyable meal. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whose side you take. If the girlfriend was supposed to share the pizza as ordered and she altered it in a way that made it less enjoyable for the author, then the author's anger might be reasonable. However, the author could have communicated better, maybe set expectations that the pizza was meant to be shared, or checked in with the girlfriend before eating their own pieces. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend might have overstepped by taking toppings off all the pieces, but the author's reaction of calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion could be seen as the real problem. The argument escalated because the author took it personally, maybe overreacted. \n\nIn the end, it's a matter of perspective. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but their reaction could be seen as disproportionate. However, if the girlfriend was being inconsiderate, then the author is justified. But since the girlfriend didn't take all the cheese, maybe the author is being too harsh. \n\nHmm. I think the key points are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that the pizza was to be shared in a certain way, and the girlfriend might have thought she could take what she wanted. The author's anger might be valid, but the way they handled it could be better. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is the girlfriend's inconsiderate action, leading to the author's justified but possibly excessive reaction.\n"
