It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The story is about the author ordering pizza, their girlfriend taking toppings off every piece, and then getting into an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, and then when he went to the kitchen, found that she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my take. \n\nLet me break it down. The author ordered pizza, assuming they'd share it. The girlfriend said she wanted some, but then took toppings off all the pieces. Maybe she thought she could have a bit without eating the whole pizza. But the author was upset because he expected her to take only part of a piece, not all the toppings from all pieces. \n\nIs the author's reaction justified? Well, pizza is a shared meal in many relationships. If you order it, expecting to share, and the other person takes the toppings off all of them, that could be seen as taking more than their share or being inconsiderate. But maybe the girlfriend thought she could have a little without making a new order. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did eat two pieces first. Maybe he didn't consider that she might want to have some without a whole slice. Also, he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might escalate the situation. She might feel that since he had already eaten, she could take what she wanted from the remaining. \n\nBut the key point is that the author assumed she would take toppings from a couple of pieces, but she did it to all. That's a big difference. The author might feel that she was being inconsiderate because now the pizza isn't as enjoyable for him. But he could have communicated better or ordered separate pizzas if he wanted to avoid that. \n\nHowever, the argument escalated because of his reaction. Maybe he overreacted by calling her names, but her action was inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger over the selfishness might not be out of proportion if they usually share meals. On the flip side, if he had already eaten his share, maybe she had the right to take what she wanted from the leftovers.\n\nI think the main issue is communication. The author should have clarified if he wanted the pizza to be untouched for him. The girlfriend might have assumed it was okay to take some. Both sides have valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author felt justified in being upset, maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, his reaction could have been harsher. But in terms of being wrong, maybe not. So I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
