It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it and it's a bit expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she would have some of whatever he gets. Then he eats two pieces, and when he checks the kitchen, finds that she took toppings off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's argument is that he paid for the pizza, ordered it because of his craving, and expected her to either take a piece or not take any toppings. She took toppings off all pieces, which he found selfish. He feels justified because he was already eating and she modified the pizza he ordered. His anger stems from feeling that she was inconsiderate and selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend might have thought that since he had already eaten, it was okay for her to adjust the pizza to her preference. She might not have considered how important the pizza was to him, especially since it was from a specific place. Her confusion about his anger suggests she didn't realize the value he placed on it. She might have considered it reasonable to take the toppings off because she didn't want a whole piece, but didn't communicate that clearly.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't clarify that the pizza was important to him and that he expected her not to alter the pizza he had ordered. The girlfriend didn't communicate her needs better either. However, since he had already eaten his portions, maybe she had the right to adjust the remaining pizza for herself. But he might have expected her to not modify the food he paid for, especially if it was a special request for him.\n\nThe question is whether the author's anger was disproportionate. The pizza was expensive and from a specific place he craved, so he might see her actions as taking something he wanted. However, she didn't take his pieces; she just modified the remaining ones. But if the pizza was ordered for him and she altered it, maybe he feels it's his to have as he likes. On the other hand, she might have thought it's okay since he had already eaten his share.\n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might have miscommunicated. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched, and the girlfriend didn't ask for his opinion on altering it. However, since he paid for it and it was his craving, maybe she overstepped by modifying it. But she did say she didn't want a whole piece, so she might have thought taking toppings off was better than not eating at all.\n\nThe argument is about selfishness. The author feels she was selfish for altering his pizza. But she was trying to accommodate her own preference. Whether that's selfish depends on their relationship dynamics. If they usually share and respect each other's preferences, maybe she should have discussed it first. But if he didn't communicate the importance of the pizza, maybe he's also at fault.\n\nIn conclusion, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he had a valid reason to be upset about his pizza being altered without his consent. However, his reaction might have been a bit strong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author could have communicated his expectations better. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because the main issue is about mutual miscommunication, and the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate without prior discussion.\n"
