It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The user ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because he was craving it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he orders it, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he checks, he finds out she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt that his girlfriend was inconsiderate by taking from all the pizza pieces, even though he had already taken two. The girlfriend's reasoning was that he had his own pieces, and she just wanted some toppings, so she took them from the remaining ones. She thought it was okay because she didn't take all the cheese, and the pizza was still edible. The author, however, saw this as selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. The key points here are about expectations and communication. When the author ordered the pizza for himself, he might have expected that the remaining pizza would be there for others or shared. But maybe he didn't communicate his expectations clearly. The girlfriend thought she was being okay by taking toppings, not realizing that the author might have a different expectation of how the pizza should be shared.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014taking from every piece\u2014might have been seen as taking more than necessary, but she didn't take the author's pieces. The author might have felt that even though he had two pieces, the rest was for both of them, so her taking from all the pieces was unfair. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since she didn't take his pieces, it was okay. The confusion here might stem from unclear boundaries or unspoken expectations.\n\nThe author's reaction of calling her selfish and the argument escalating could be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend was confused and didn't realize the issue. However, if the author felt that the act of taking from all the pieces, even if not his own, was inconsiderate, his reaction might be based on valid feelings of being disrespected or not considered. It's possible that the author's sensitivity to how the pizza was handled is a personal boundary that wasn't communicated, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that both parties could have handled the situation better. The author could have communicated his expectations more clearly before ordering the pizza, and the girlfriend could have asked for permission or considered if the author wanted to keep the remaining pizza intact. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. Since the author initiated the argument by getting angry and calling his girlfriend selfish, which led to a bigger fight, he might be seen as at fault for overreacting. However, if the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, then the author's reaction could be justified.\n\nBut given that the girlfriend was confused and didn't see the problem, the author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate. The situation is somewhat trivial (just pizza), but the author felt strongly about it. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms around sharing and communication in relationships. In many cases, arguments over such issues often stem from underlying communication problems rather than the issue itself. So, the author might be in the wrong for blowing it out of proportion, even if his feelings were valid. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps inconsiderate, might not have been malicious, and the author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n"
