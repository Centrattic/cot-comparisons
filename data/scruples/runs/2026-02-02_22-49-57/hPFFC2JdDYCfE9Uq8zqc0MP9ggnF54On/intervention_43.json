It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation. So, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author ordered an expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ate two pieces and went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that when she said she'd have some of the pizza, she might take toppings off a couple of pieces. But she took from all of them. The problem is that he didn't check before eating more, and she didn't communicate her actions. But she also didn't ask for permission or clarify her intentions. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because he paid for the pizza expecting to share it. However, reacting with anger and calling her names could escalate the situation unnecessarily. On the other hand, her not asking and taking what she wanted without considering his feelings might also be an issue. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. He didn't know she was doing that until he saw the result. His reaction might be over the top, but it's a personal reaction to feeling disrespected. However, maybe he should have discussed it calmly instead of starting a fight. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because his feelings are valid, but his reaction could have been handled better. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the argument could have been avoided with better communication from both sides. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
