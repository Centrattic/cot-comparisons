She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves a girlfriend taking toppings off every piece, which the author found inconsiderate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they craved, expecting their partner to maybe take a few pieces or some toppings. They ordered it for themselves but offered the partner some. The partner said she'd have some of whatever, but when it came, she took toppings off every piece. The author was upset, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author overreact? The partner didn't eat the whole pizza, just took some toppings. The author might feel that their personal choice of food was respected, but the partner altered the pizza in a way they found disrespectful. The partner's action of removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as not considering the author's preference for how the pizza should be eaten.\n\nBut wait, the partner said she didn't want a whole piece but some toppings. The author thought she meant taking one or two pieces' toppings. The partner's action of removing from all pieces might have been a misunderstanding. The author's anger could be about the lack of communication and the partner acting on assumptions. However, the argument escalated by calling the partner selfish and inconsiderate, which might have been harsh given the situation is just about food.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner was eating the same pizza, so maybe the author should have considered sharing. However, the partner altered the food in a way that the author values. The question is about whether the author's reaction was out of line. The partner's response of saying the author was acting like a child might indicate she didn't see the problem. The author might be right in feeling that the partner wasn't considerate, but the way they expressed it could be the issue. However, the partner's action could be seen as inconsiderate too. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often about communication and expectations. The author might have expected the partner to ask for a different arrangement if she wanted to modify the pizza. The partner might not have realized the extent of the author's preference. The argument might have stemmed from a lack of clear communication rather than intentional selfishness. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the partner's action was a misunderstanding, then maybe the author overreacted. However, if the partner's action was indeed selfish (taking toppings off all pieces without considering the author's preference), then the author isn't wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's anger was justified. Given that the partner's actions were inconsiderate, the author's reaction might be justified. Therefore, the answer could be B (the author isn't in the wrong). But if the author's reaction was too harsh for the situation, then A. But the partner's action of taking toppings off every piece might be more inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't unwarranted. So B.\n"
