She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza for themselves and their girlfriend, right? They ordered from a specific place that's more expensive but worth it. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever the author gets. The author grabs two pieces, goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and then when the author goes to the kitchen, they find that the girlfriend has taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nThe author gets angry, calls her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The girlfriend is confused and thinks the author is overreacting. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author ordered pizza, assuming their girlfriend would have some of it. The girlfriend agreed to have some, but when the author took two pieces, the girlfriend ended up modifying all the remaining pieces. The author's frustration seems to come from the fact that they wanted to eat the pizza as it was, and the girlfriend's actions made it hard for them to eat it as they liked. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author had already taken their share, she could take what was left, even if she preferred just the toppings.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, maybe the initial assumption is that when they ordered the pizza, they expected to split it with their partner. The girlfriend agreed to have some, but then took what was left in a way that affected the author's meal. The author might feel that their partner was being inconsiderate by altering the remaining pizza in a way that made it less enjoyable for them. However, the author's reaction was to call the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The author might be overreacting, especially since the girlfriend thought she was only taking some toppings and not the entire cheese. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as selfish, as it affects the author's ability to enjoy their own pizza. The author had a right to expect that the pizza they paid for, which they wanted, would be available for them to eat as they wanted. The girlfriend's actions, while maybe not malicious, did interfere with that. \n\nHowever, the author also could have communicated better. When they asked if the girlfriend wanted anything and she said no, maybe the author should have ordered an extra pizza if they knew they wanted a specific type. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have asked if she wanted to modify the pizza. The line between personal preference and shared resources is a bit blurry here. \n\nIn terms of the argument, the author's anger might be justified if they felt their partner was being inconsiderate by altering their food without asking. But the way they reacted\u2014calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, and escalating the argument\u2014could be seen as disproportionate. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't realize the impact of her actions. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps they could have handled the situation better without calling names. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the girlfriend modified the pizza without consulting the author, which affected the author's meal, the author's anger is somewhat justified. However, the argument escalated due to the author's reaction. The key is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. Since the author didn't do anything to cause this; the girlfriend did the action. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (no).\n"
