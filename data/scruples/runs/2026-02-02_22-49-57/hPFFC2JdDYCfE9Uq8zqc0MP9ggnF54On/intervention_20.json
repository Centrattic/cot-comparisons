It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza because he was craving it from a specific, more expensive place. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she would just have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered it, ate two pieces, and went back to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when the author checked, she said she had eaten some toppings but not the whole piece. The author assumed maybe she took toppings from a couple of pieces. But when he went to the kitchen, he found that she had removed toppings and cheese from every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author ordered pizza for himself, invited the girlfriend to join, and she chose to take toppings off all the pieces. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take small amounts without eating the whole piece, but the author felt that was being selfish and wasteful. \n\nBut wait, the author ordered the pizza, it's his purchase. If the girlfriend wanted to eat some of it, she could have asked or at least communicated better. The author might have expected her to take a whole piece if she wanted something, but she didn't. On the other hand, the author didn't specify that she couldn't take toppings off the pieces he ordered. So maybe the girlfriend overstepped by taking from all the pieces, but the author's reaction of calling her selfish might be a bit strong. \n\nHowever, the author did order the pizza for himself, so maybe he's not entirely wrong to be upset. But then again, the girlfriend was in the situation where she didn't order anything, so maybe she felt entitled to take some without eating the whole piece. The confusion here is that the author thought she took a bit from a couple, but she took from all. That's a big difference. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because his pizza was altered in a way he didn't expect, and he felt it was a selfish act. However, the girlfriend might have had a different perspective, thinking she was sharing the pizza without taking a full slice. The problem here is a lack of communication. Neither party clearly explained their expectations. \n\nBut the author did ask if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of his pizza. If she wanted to take toppings off all the pieces, that's more than just \"having some.\" The author might reasonably expect that she would take a whole slice if she wanted to eat, but she didn't. So maybe the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion\u2014is part of the issue. The argument could have been avoided with better communication. The author's anger might be disproportionate because it's just pizza, but the girlfriend's actions were also a bit inconsiderate. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author isn't entirely wrong for being upset, especially if he expected her to take a whole piece. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate because she altered all the pizza without discussing it. However, the author's reaction might have escalated things unnecessarily. \n\nBut according to the question, we need to choose between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author ordered the pizza and the girlfriend altered it without prior agreement, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the lack of communication from both sides, but the author's anger, while maybe strong, is a response to something that could be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer is B.\n"
