It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation is a bit specific, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza they really wanted, even though it was a bit expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of what he got. So he ordered, ate two pieces, and then noticed later that she had taken toppings off every slice. That's when the argument started. The author felt angry because they thought she was being selfish and inconsiderate, and she responded by saying he was being a child.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author had already eaten two pieces, and the rest was left. The girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, which the author found offensive. But why would she do that? She said she didn't want a whole piece, just the toppings. Maybe she thought it was okay to take what she wanted without considering the author's feelings. But the author was expecting that taking toppings off a few pieces was acceptable, not all of them. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she would only take a small amount, but she took more than anticipated. The author's reaction was anger, calling her selfish, while she called him childish. \n\nBut is the author justified? Well, the pizza was expensive, and he had craved it all day. Taking toppings off every piece might have left him with a less enjoyable meal. However, maybe the author should have considered that sharing the pizza was part of the deal. If he ordered it for both of them, perhaps he should have been more specific about how much he wanted. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't ask for permission and took what she wanted without considering the other person's feelings. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. The author didn't check again when she wasn't eating initially, and the girlfriend didn't ask before modifying the pizza. Both could have handled it better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he got angry over something that might not have been intentional, maybe his reaction was a bit over the top. However, his feelings about his expensive, craved pizza being altered might make his reaction understandable. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend said she would have some of whatever he got. If he ordered it for both, maybe he should have expected her to take some. However, taking all the toppings off every piece is extreme. The author's anger might be justified because he didn't expect that. But is it the author's fault for not making clearer boundaries? \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend should have communicated her preference better. She didn't eat initially, then when she did, she altered the pizza in a way that affected his experience. So the author isn't entirely wrong. He's upset because his experience was ruined. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could have communicated better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he ordered the pizza for both, maybe he should have considered that she might take some, but she went beyond what was reasonable. Therefore, the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were selfish and he had a right to be upset. But there's a middle ground where both could have communicated better. However, the main fault lies with the girlfriend for taking so much without considering the other person.\n"
