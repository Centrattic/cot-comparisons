It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and when they went to the kitchen, found their girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece. They got angry, called her selfish, and it led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author thought they ordered pizza for both of them, but the girlfriend didn't take any when asked. Then later, she took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt it was inconsiderate, while the girlfriend thought it was just fine.\n\nThe key points here might be communication and expectations. The author assumed that ordering pizza would be shared, but the girlfriend didn't take any initially. Maybe she was okay with sharing later, but the way she took toppings off all the pieces might have been a problem. However, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and start an argument, which could be seen as overreacting.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend did take toppings from every piece, which the author found extreme. The author might feel that the pizza was meant to be shared, and taking toppings off all pieces was taking more than her share. However, the girlfriend might think that since the author already ate their pieces, the remaining was okay to modify as she wanted.\n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't check if the girlfriend wanted to eat before taking their own pieces. Maybe they should have waited to eat until the pizza was shared or discussed how much each would eat. But the girlfriend also didn't communicate her intentions clearly when she took the toppings off. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had asked the girlfriend earlier if she wanted to take toppings, maybe this could have been avoided. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces without discussion might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIt's possible that both parties miscommunicated. The author might have felt entitled to the pizza they ordered, while the girlfriend thought she could do with the leftovers as she pleased. The argument escalated because neither clarified their expectations beforehand.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author did order pizza intending to share, but maybe they should have waited to eat until the girlfriend took her share. However, the girlfriend taking toppings off all the remaining pieces without discussing might be the bigger issue. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and starting a fight could be seen as overreacting. \n\nIn the end, it's a matter of perspective. The author might not be in the wrong for getting upset about their pizza being altered, but their reaction could have been more constructive. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was also harsh. So, maybe the answer is that both have some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, I need to see if there's justification. The girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza might have been selfish, but the author's response was to start a fight, which is a problem. However, if the pizza was meant to be shared, the girlfriend's action was inappropriate. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend did act inconsiderately by altering the pizza without discussion. But the author could have handled it better. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong, and the answer would be B (No), since the girlfriend's actions were more at fault, even though the author's reaction could be improved.\n"
