It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that he ordered pizza from a specific place, which was expensive but worth it. He told his girlfriend he was ordering and asked if she wanted something. She said no, but wanted some of whatever he got. He took two slices, went to watch TV, and she was in the kitchen. When he went to get more, he found that she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy was craving this specific pizza, which was a treat. He ordered it for himself but intended to share since she wanted some. He took two pieces, which he probably thought was reasonable. The girlfriend said she just wanted some toppings, so he assumed she would take from a couple of pieces. However, she took from every piece, making the rest less enjoyable for him. He felt that was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to the argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he had already taken his two pieces, she was entitled to take what she wanted from the remaining pizza. She might not have realized that taking toppings off all pieces would make the rest less appealing to him. She could have thought it was a reasonable way to get the toppings she wanted without taking full slices.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The guy expected her to take only some pieces, not all the toppings off every piece. The girlfriend might have thought that since he had already eaten two, she could take what she wanted. However, she didn't consider how removing toppings from all pieces would affect his enjoyment. The guy felt it was inconsiderate because now all the pizza is less than ideal for him. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong for getting angry over this? Well, it's just pizza, but the girlfriend's action did impact his enjoyment. He might have overreacted if he was angry about the toppings being taken, but if that's important to him, maybe not. The girlfriend's confusion adds to the issue\u2014she didn't realize the impact of her actions. The argument escalated because of this misunderstanding. \n\nBut the guy did start the fight by calling her selfish and acting like a child, which could be seen as the trigger. However, the root cause is the girlfriend's action leading to his frustration. So, who is more at fault? \n\nThe user thinks the author (the guy) isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), then it's because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the guy was justified in being upset. If it's A (in the wrong), then maybe the guy overreacted. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The guy could have discussed his feelings before getting angry. However, the girlfriend didn't consider the impact of her actions. The situation is a bit of a grey area. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering the actions of both, the answer might be B because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the guy was justified in being upset, even if the fight escalated. Alternatively, maybe the guy is in the wrong for overreacting. \n\nBut the user's perspective is that the guy is not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
