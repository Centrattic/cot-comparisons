It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered expensive pizza they were craving, shared it with their girlfriend, who initially said she'd have some of whatever he got. When he went to eat, he took two pieces, and she was in the kitchen. Later, she came back and ate some toppings off every piece, leaving him upset.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she would take some toppings off a few pieces, but she took from all of them, making the pizza inedible for him. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't communicate her actions and thought it was fine to take toppings since there was leftovers. \n\nIs the author overreacting? The argument was about someone else's food being altered without consent. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, maybe, but the author's reaction was to call her selfish and start a fight. However, the author might feel that their property (the pizza they paid for) was altered without permission. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong for blowing it out of proportion? The girlfriend didn't ask, and her action was inconsiderate. However, the author could have handled it calmly instead of escalating. The question is whether the anger was justified. Since the pizza was a shared purchase (he ordered it, but she was eating it too), maybe there was an unspoken agreement that they could both partake. The author might not have considered that she wouldn't take entire pieces but just toppings. However, taking chunks from every piece is excessive. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was dismissive, which is also a problem. But the author's anger led to a fight. The question is whether the author's anger was unwarranted. The answer might hinge on whether the action (taking toppings) was selfish and if the reaction was proportionate. Since the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument, maybe the author is partially at fault for not communicating better. But the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. But the core issue is that the girlfriend altered the pizza without permission, which the author rightly found inconsiderate. The fight might have been avoidable with better communication, but the initial action by the girlfriend was the inciting incident. So the author's reaction, while perhaps a bit intense, might be justified given the disrespect to the food he paid for. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
