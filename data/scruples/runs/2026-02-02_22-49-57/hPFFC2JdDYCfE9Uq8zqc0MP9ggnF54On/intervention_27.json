It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a fight over pizza between a guy and his girlfriend. The guy wanted pizza from an expensive place and asked her if she wanted anything. She said no, but later took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy was looking forward to the pizza, which was important to him. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. The girl said she just wanted some toppings, but ended up taking from all the pieces. The guy was upset because he thought she was being selfish. The girl, on the other hand, thought that since he had already eaten, it wasn't a big deal. She might have been trying to take only what she wanted, but maybe didn't consider how much was left or how he felt about it.\n\nHmm, communication seems to be an issue here. The girl might not have realized that the guy values the pizza a lot, so when she took from all the pieces, it was a bigger deal than she expected. But maybe the guy could have communicated his feelings better. He just called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nBut was he justified? If the girl took from all the pieces, even though he had already eaten, it's possible he felt she was being unfair. However, maybe he overreacted. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, but does that make the guy's anger excessive? It's possible both sides had a role. The girl didn't consider his feelings, but the guy could have handled it without escalating to a fight. \n\nWait, the guy said he was starving and the pizza was worth it. So he had a strong craving. The girl's action of taking toppings off every piece might have ruined his experience. If she had taken just one or two pieces, maybe it wouldn't have been a problem, but taking from all of them shows she didn't respect his need to enjoy the pizza. However, the guy's response was to call her selfish and argue, which might have been harsh. \n\nI think the key here is whether the guy's reaction was proportional. He was clearly upset, but did he have the right to be angry? Maybe partially. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, but the guy could have discussed it calmly instead of getting angry. On the other hand, the girl might have been selfish without realizing it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy might not be entirely in the wrong because the girl's actions were inconsiderate. But he also could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girl was selfish, then maybe he's not at fault. But maybe they both contributed. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the girl's actions were selfish, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish, leading to an argument) might have been part of the problem. But the initial anger is justified.\n"
