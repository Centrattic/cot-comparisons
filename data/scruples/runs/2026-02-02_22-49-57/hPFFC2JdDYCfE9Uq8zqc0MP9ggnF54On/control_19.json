It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the A-hole) post is wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza they really wanted, told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted something. She said no but then took toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author ordered the pizza because they were craving it, which might be a bit expensive. The girlfriend said she would have some of whatever the author got but didn't take any when the pizza arrived. The author ate two pieces, then went back to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen but came back without eating. The author assumed she took toppings off one or two pieces, but she actually did it to every piece. The author was upset, called her selfish, and the girlfriend got annoyed, saying the author was overreacting.\n\nThe question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author paid for the pizza they wanted, maybe even a bit more expensive, and thought the girlfriend would take a couple of toppings off. Instead, she took toppings off all pieces, making the pizza less desirable for the author. The author felt it was selfish because they wanted to eat it as they ordered. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take toppings off the remaining pieces since the author had already eaten two. She might have considered it a minor action, not realizing how much the author wanted the pizza. She might have felt it was her own food to handle as she wished, especially since she initially said she didn't want anything. The author's reaction could be seen as over the top because the actions weren't malicious, just different preferences.\n\nBut the author's frustration is understandable. They specifically wanted that pizza, maybe even paid more, and the girlfriend's actions made it less enjoyable. The girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions and didn't consider the author's preferences. The author's anger might be justified because they expected their order to be respected, especially since they were the one who ordered and paid for it. \n\nHowever, the argument escalated because the author called the girlfriend selfish and childish, which could have been handled better. Maybe a calm discussion instead of an accusation. The girlfriend's response was defensive, but she might have a point in that it's not a huge issue. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions were unreasonable given the context. The author's anger might be seen as a proportional response to their craving and the cost, while the girlfriend's actions were a bit inconsiderate but not malicious. However, the author's reaction in the argument could have been more constructive. But the initial problem is the girlfriend altering the food without discussing it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. However, the way the author reacted could be seen as part of the problem. But since the question is about starting the fight, the author did get angry, but perhaps justified. The girlfriend started taking the toppings without permission, which is the root cause. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend was the one who altered the food without considering the author's preferences.\n"
