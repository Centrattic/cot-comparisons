It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. He orders it, takes two slices, and she's in the kitchen for a while. When he checks, he finds she's removed toppings and cheese from every piece.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought she might take toppings off a couple of slices, but she did it to all. He felt it was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. She got defensive, saying he was overreacting and acting like a child.\n\nFirst, did the author do anything wrong? He ordered pizza as a treat for himself, which he was craving. He offered her some, which she accepted but with the condition of modifying the toppings. The misunderstanding came from her taking off everything from all slices, whereas he expected maybe just a few. The problem is that the author didn't clarify that he wanted to eat the pizza as ordered. If he had specified that, the conflict might have been avoided. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have overstepped by altering all the pizza without checking with him. But the argument started because the author got angry, maybe escalating it. So, maybe both have some responsibility. But according to the options, it's either A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no). The question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. Since he could have communicated his preferences better and reacted strongly to what he considered selfishness, maybe he's partly at fault. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But the initial action of ordering the pizza and the reaction... It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the relationship dynamics and how they handle differences. The girlfriend was confused and defensive, but the author's anger might have been too intense. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for overreacting, leading to the fight. But the girlfriend's behavior also contributed. Since the question is about who started the fight, and the author called her selfish and escalated it, even if justified, he initiated the argument. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
