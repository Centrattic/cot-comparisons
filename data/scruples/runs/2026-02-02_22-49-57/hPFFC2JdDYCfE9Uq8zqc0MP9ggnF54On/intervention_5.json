It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza order. The author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza they were craving. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, but then later took toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and specifically wanted that place. They thought the girlfriend would either take some pizza or not. When the pizza arrived, the author ate two pieces, but the girlfriend didn't take any. She was in the kitchen for a while, so maybe she was taking her time. When the author went to get more pizza, they found that the girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece. The author got angry because they thought she was being selfish, taking what she wanted without considering the author's craving and the expense. The girlfriend was confused and defensive, saying she didn't take all the cheese and that the author had their own pieces.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they had a legitimate craving and paid for the pizza. They expected their girlfriend to either eat some or not interfere. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces might be seen as taking without considering the other person's needs. The author felt their request for her to have some of the pizza was ignored, leading to frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. She might have thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole piece, but instead taking some toppings. However, taking toppings from every piece could ruin the author's experience, especially if they had a specific craving. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness might stem from not seeing the issue the same way the author does.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that the girlfriend would either eat some pizza or leave it, but the girlfriend's action of modifying the pizza wasn't anticipated. The author's anger might be justified because their needs were not respected, considering the expense and craving. However, the argument escalated, and calling the girlfriend selfish might have been harsh if she didn't realize the impact. But given the context, the author's reaction could be seen as a reasonable response to feeling disrespected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to feel upset. The main issue is whether the author's response was proportionate. While arguments aren't ideal, the underlying action of the girlfriend taking toppings without considering the author's needs could make the author's reaction understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
