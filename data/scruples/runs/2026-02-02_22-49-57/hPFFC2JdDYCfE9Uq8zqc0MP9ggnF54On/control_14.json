It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight over pizza with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author ordered pizza from an expensive place they wanted. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he gets. Then he orders, eats two pieces, and when he checks the kitchen, he finds she's taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue. The girlfriend is confused and says he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to get angry? Was the girlfriend's action selfish? Did the author do something wrong?\n\nThe author ordered the pizza and paid for it, but he offered it to his girlfriend. She declined initially but then took parts of the pizza without him knowing. The act of removing toppings and cheese from all the pieces might be seen as taking without consent, especially if the author expected her to have her own pizza or not touch his. However, the girlfriend thought she was just having some of the toppings, not taking the author's portion. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling that his girlfriend was inconsiderate by modifying the pizza he paid for without his knowledge. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the extent of what she did or thought she was sharing. The line here is about communication and expectations. The author could have specified that he wanted to eat the pizza himself or that he expected her to order her own if she wanted something different. Alternatively, the girlfriend should have communicated her actions or ordered her own meal if she didn't want the same as him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza with the intention of sharing, I think. He asked her if she wanted something, she said no, then later took from it. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting because the pizza wasn't his alone to consume entirely, but he might have expected her to order her own. However, the girlfriend's action of altering the pizza without consent could be inconsiderate. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author's anger was justified. Since the girlfriend took from the pizza he ordered, using the argument that she wanted some toppings but didn't order it herself, maybe the author did have a right to be upset. However, the way he reacted by calling her selfish and starting an argument might be seen as disproportionate. The girlfriend's response was confusion, indicating she didn't see the issue. \n\nSo, perhaps the author is not entirely in the wrong. The problem is mutual communication. However, the author could have handled it better without escalating. But the core of the issue is whether the action was selfish. If the pizza was meant to be shared, then taking parts without consent is inconsiderate. But if the author intended to eat it himself, then the girlfriend should have ordered her own. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is whether his reaction was justified. Since he felt his property (the pizza) was being altered without consent, but he did offer it to her. So maybe both are at fault, but the question is about the author. The answer might hinge on whether the author was wrong to order the pizza alone and then expect her not to take parts. But he did ask her if she wanted something, and she said no. Then she changed her mind. \n\nIn that case, the author's anger might be because he felt his wishes were disregarded. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces is definitely inconsiderate. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but his reaction might have been harsh. However, the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's anger is a valid response to her taking without consent. However, the way he handled it could have been better. But the core issue is her action, so the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
