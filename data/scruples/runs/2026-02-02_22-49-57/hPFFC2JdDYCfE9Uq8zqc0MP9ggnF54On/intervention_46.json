It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered an expensive pizza they were craving, offered the girlfriend a share, and then found out later that she took toppings off every piece, leaving it inedible for the author. The argument ensued, and the author feels justified in their anger, while the girlfriend thinks it's blown out of proportion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions they were starving and had specifically chosen this pizza, which was a splurge. They ordered it and expected to share, but when they went to get more, they found the pizza messed up. The girlfriend's action of removing toppings and cheese from every piece seems excessive. If she wanted a different type of pizza, she could have ordered her own or communicated that need before the pizza arrived. However, she didn't, and instead modified the existing pizza, which the author found inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The question here is whether the author overreacted. The key points are: communication, expectations, and proportionality. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched when ordering, so maybe they should have considered that the girlfriend might adjust it. But the girlfriend didn't ask for permission, which is a problem. She assumed she could modify the pizza without considering the author's preference. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling that their choice and effort (ordering a specific, expensive pizza) were disrespected. However, the girlfriend might have thought it was a minor adjustment. The issue is whether the author's reaction was proportional. While the action was selfish, the response was to escalate into a fight, which might not have been necessary. \n\nBut considering that the girlfriend didn't communicate her needs and altered the food without consent, the author has a valid grievance. The problem is more about the girlfriend's behavior than the author's reaction. However, the author could have addressed the situation calmly first instead of immediately calling her names, which might have de-escalated things. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have failed to set expectations about the pizza, and the girlfriend overstepped by modifying it without discussion. The author's anger is understandable, but the way they handled it could have been better. However, given the context, the girlfriend's actions were more inconsiderate. So, the author is not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach. The main fault lies with the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
