It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and his girlfriend. Let's break down the events step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was really craving pizza from a specific place and mentioned it's a bit expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he gets. Then he ordered it, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, the author noticed she wasn't eating. She said she took toppings off the pizza, but when he checked the kitchen, he found that she had removed toppings and chunks of cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nNow, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for starting the fight. The user thinks he's not wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He ordered pizza based on his girlfriend's initial agreement. He assumed she would take some of the pizza he ordered, maybe two pieces. When he found out she took toppings off all the pieces, he felt she was being selfish because now the pizza he had ordered was altered in a way he didn't agree to. He might have felt it was inconsiderate since he had already eaten some, and she changed the remaining pizza. His anger could stem from feeling disrespected or that she didn't communicate her intentions. Maybe he expected her to take a piece if she wanted to eat, rather than modifying all the pizza.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She might have thought she was saving money by taking the toppings off. Since the author had already taken two pieces, maybe she felt it was okay to take what she wanted from the remaining pizza. She might have thought she wasn't taking the entire pizza, just some parts. Her confusion when he got angry suggests she didn't see her actions as selfish. She might have felt the author was overreacting because she didn't take the whole pizza, just parts of it. She might have also thought that since he had already eaten, it was okay to adjust the remaining pizza as she saw fit.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The author expected that when he ordered pizza for them, she would take a piece or two, not modify the remaining pizza significantly. The girlfriend might have had different expectations, thinking she could take toppings off without affecting his experience. The initial agreement was that she would eat \"some of whatever pizza he gets,\" which might have led her to believe she didn't need to take a whole piece. However, removing toppings from all the pieces changes the pizza in a way that affects both of them, especially since the author had already eaten some. \n\nThe question is whether the author's anger was justified. If the girlfriend's actions indeed made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him, then he has a point. On the other hand, if he had communicated his expectations more clearly, maybe the situation could have been avoided. But from the description, it seems like the girlfriend didn't communicate her intention to take toppings off, leading to a surprise when the author discovered it. \n\nThe argument escalated because he called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might have been a harsh reaction. However, the act of modifying all the pizza pieces without his consent could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's confusion and dismissing his anger by calling him a child might have exacerbated the situation. \n\nIn relationships, misunderstandings can happen, and communication is key. The author might have overreacted emotionally, but the underlying issue of the girlfriend's actions affecting the shared meal is valid. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whose actions were more inconsiderate. The girlfriend's modification of the pizza without discussion could be seen as selfish, but the author's response, while emotionally charged, might be a result of feeling disrespected. \n\nHowever, since the author called her names and the argument got heated, maybe there's some fault on his side for reacting so strongly. But the initial action of the girlfriend altering the pizza might still be the root cause. The question is whether his anger was proportionate. Since it's just pizza, maybe he did overreact, but the act of her taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn summary, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate because she altered the pizza without consent, which affected both of them. The author's anger is understandable in that context. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and starting an argument might have been overly harsh. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be that he's not entirely wrong because the girlfriend's actions were the catalyst. But maybe the author could have handled it differently without escalating. However, given the description, the main fault lies with the girlfriend for her actions, so the author isn't in the wrong for getting upset. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
