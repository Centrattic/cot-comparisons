It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They mentioned they were starving and offered their girlfriend to get something. She declined, saying she'd have some of what he got. Then he ordered and ate two pieces. When he went to the kitchen, he found that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, she was confused, and they argued.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author's perspective: he paid for a specific pizza he was craving, and when he went to eat more, he found that the remaining pizza was ruined for him because the toppings were removed. He felt it was selfish and inconsiderate. His anger might stem from feeling that his girlfriend didn't consider his desire to eat the pizza as it was ordered.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: she said she would take some toppings, not necessarily the whole piece. She might not have realized that removing toppings from all pieces would affect the author's ability to eat them later. She might have thought she was being considerate by taking only a little, but it seems like she overdid it without considering the author's feelings. However, she might not have intended to be selfish, just maybe misjudged the situation.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the pizza was expensive and he was starving, which adds to the frustration. But removing toppings from all the pieces does seem inconsiderate if the author wanted to eat them later. However, the girlfriend might not have known he would want to eat more, especially since he had already taken two pieces. Maybe she thought the pizza was his and she was just using it as a topping bar for herself. But taking all the toppings off every piece makes it less enjoyable for the author, so that's a problem.\n\nThe argument escalated because the author called her selfish, which she found hurtful. Maybe he could have addressed it without name-calling. But the root issue is about consideration. If the girlfriend didn't communicate her actions beforehand, that's a problem. The author might have a point in feeling his preferences weren't respected. However, he could have discussed the situation calmly instead of escalating it into a fight. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have asked beforehand if she wanted to take toppings off, and the girlfriend should have considered that the pizza was ordered for both. But since the author already ate two pieces, maybe the girlfriend thought the rest was hers to handle. However, taking all toppings off every piece was excessive. \n\nSo, the author's anger is understandable, but his reaction (calling her selfish and starting a big argument) might have been the problem. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response might have been too harsh. It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't entirely wrong because the girlfriend did do something that affected his enjoyment, but he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate (even if unintentionally), the author's frustration is valid. But the way he reacted (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) might be where he's in the wrong. However, the initial action of the girlfriend was also a problem. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A or B. Considering that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was also unhelpful, but the main question is whether the author is wrong. Since the user is the one asking, and from the description, the author's anger is not entirely wrong because the girlfriend did do something to affect his meal. However, the way he handled it could have been better. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), because his anger was justified. Or A (in the wrong) because he overreacted.\n\nIn similar situations, people often split the difference. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was harsh. However, the core issue is the inconsiderate action. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being angry, but his approach was flawed. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight. Starting the fight could be his fault if he overreacted. But since the girlfriend's action was also problematic, it's a mutual issue. However, the options are A or B. Given that the author's anger was about a valid point (the girlfriend's inconsiderate action), but his reaction was the problem. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry, then maybe not. But if it's about the way he handled it, then maybe he is. But the question is phrased as \"starting a fight over pizza,\" which could be seen as overreacting. But the girlfriend's action was also a problem. \n\nGiven that, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and his reaction, while perhaps harsh, was rooted in a valid grievance. But it's a tough call. However, in the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, sometimes the person is considered not the asshole if their reaction is to an inconsiderate action. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
