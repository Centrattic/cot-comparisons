It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza they were craving. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ate two pieces, went to the living room, and when he checked later, she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author thought she would just take a piece or maybe a little from one or two. Instead, she took from all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. He was expecting her to share or at least leave some for him, especially since he had already eaten two. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was saving the pizza for him since he had already eaten, and she just wanted some toppings. She was confused why he was upset because he had already had his share.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and communication. The author assumed she would only take a small amount, but she ended up taking from all pieces. He might have felt that she wasn't respecting his effort to include her by offering the pizza. However, she might have felt he didn't communicate his expectations clearly. The argument escalated because both didn't see the other's perspective. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did start the argument by calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion, as she mentioned. But he also had a valid point about her taking from all the pizza, which left none for him. The question is whether his reaction was justified. Since the pizza was expensive and he was looking forward to it, his frustration is understandable. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her names and escalating the argument\u2014might be where he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate too, but the author's response could have been handled better without the harsh language. \n\nSo, while both have points, the author's immediate reaction and choice of words likely contributed to the argument. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to check if the main issue is the argument's escalation rather than the initial action. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but maybe the argument's handling is the problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If starting the fight refers to the initial anger, maybe not, but if it's about the way he handled it, then yes. The answer might hinge on that nuance.\n"
