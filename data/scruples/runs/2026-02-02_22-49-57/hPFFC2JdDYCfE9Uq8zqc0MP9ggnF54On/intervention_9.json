It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. It's more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of what he ordered. Then he ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he went to the kitchen, found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and expectations. When he ordered the pizza, he might have expected her to wait for him to order something that suits both of them. But he didn't check with her again after she said she'd have some of what he gets. Maybe he assumed she would wait for him to order, but she took initiative. However, she didn't specify her preferences beforehand. When he ordered, she said she didn't want a whole piece, just the toppings. He thought she meant taking off some toppings from a few pieces. But she actually took toppings off every piece. That's a misunderstanding. \n\nIs the author at fault for not confirming her preferences again before ordering? Or is the girlfriend at fault for not being clear? Also, when he got angry and called her selfish, maybe he overreacted. The act of taking toppings off all pieces might be inconsiderate, but was the author's reaction proportionate? The girlfriend might have thought she could adjust the pizza to her liking, not realizing that the author was using it. \n\nBut the author had already eaten two pieces. So there's a part where maybe he should have considered that he had food for himself, and she might be doing something to the remaining pizza. However, the fact that she altered all the pizza might have made it less enjoyable for the author. The question is whether the author's anger was justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't think about her needing to eat something that suits her, but he was also expecting her to wait for another order. But he didn't clarify that. So both parties might have miscommunication. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend did alter the pizza in a way that affected his meal. But he could have handled it better. However, the girlfriend might also be at fault for not communicating her needs properly. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, then answer B. But maybe the author's reaction was too harsh. The answer could be B, but maybe there's a nuance.\n"
