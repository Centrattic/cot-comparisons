It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza order. The author was really craving pizza, ordered from a specific place which is a bit expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she would just have some of whatever he gets. He orders it, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, and later comes back. When the author checks the kitchen, he finds that she took toppings and cheese off every piece of pizza.\n\nNow, the main conflict here is whether the author's reaction was justified. The girlfriend thought it was fine because she took some, not all, and the author got angry, calling her selfish and leading to a big argument. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the girlfriend's actions. She said she would have some of whatever he gets, implying she would take a piece or part of the pizza. But instead of taking a piece, she took toppings off all the pieces. That seems like she's taking from his order without asking, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author already took two pieces for himself, leaving the rest. The girlfriend might have thought that since he had his share, the remaining was fair game. But the problem is that the pizza was ordered by the author, perhaps with his money, and she didn't ask if she could take some. \n\nThe author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish. Was that justified? The girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza, just modified the remaining pieces. But the author might feel entitled to the pizza as it was his order. However, since the girlfriend was part of the household and part of the relationship, maybe she assumed that the pizza was a shared order. The confusion here is that the author didn't specify whether she could take some, and she might have thought it was okay because she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. But instead of taking a piece, she took toppings from all, which is an unusual approach. \n\nThe girlfriend's confusion and her response that the author had his pieces might indicate she didn't see it as a big deal. The author, on the other hand, felt it was a display of selfishness. The argument escalated, and he called her names. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reaction was proportionate. \n\nIn some relationships, sharing food is expected, and taking without asking might be seen as rude. However, if the girlfriend thought the pizza was a shared order, she might not have realized it was wrong. The author could have handled it by talking calmly instead of yelling and calling her selfish. But the girlfriend's actions did seem inconsiderate, as she modified all the pizza without asking, which might be worse than just taking a piece. \n\nSo, the question is: Who is more in the wrong? The author's anger might be justified because of the girlfriend's inconsiderate action, but his response (calling her names and the argument) might have been excessive. However, the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the girlfriend's actions were truly selfish, then the author might not be wrong for being upset. However, the way he reacted (anger, name-calling) might be the issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering that the pizza was a shared order and for overreacting. But the girlfriend's actions were indeed questionable. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the author had a right to be upset. If the pizza was his to order and he didn't specify sharing, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the expectation was to share, then the girlfriend was wrong. However, the author's reaction might have been too harsh. \n\nIn many relationships, such situations are resolved through communication rather than arguments. The author's choice of words (\"selfish,\" \"childish\") might have been uncalled for, even if he felt wronged. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for how he reacted, even if the girlfriend did something inconsiderate. But the initial action by the girlfriend was also inconsiderate. \n\nGiven that, it's possible the author is not entirely in the wrong, but his reaction might have been part of the problem. The answer depends on which part is more significant: the girlfriend's inconsiderate action or the author's reaction. If the question is about the author's anger over the situation, perhaps he's not in the wrong for being upset, but the way he handled it is. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is whether his anger was justified, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the answer is about his reaction (yelling, calling her names), then he might be in the wrong. \n\nIn the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding starting the fight. The fight started because the author was angry and called her selfish. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction is what led to the fight. So, if the author's reaction was disproportionate, he might be in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's actions were genuinely selfish, then the author's anger is understandable. \n\nIn many cases, people might think that taking toppings from all the pizza without asking is inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't unreasonable. Therefore, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the argument escalated because he called her names, which could be seen as his fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author was upset over a valid reason. However, his reaction might have been too harsh, but the initial anger isn't necessarily wrong. The key point is the girlfriend's behavior, which was selfish. So the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about that.\n"
