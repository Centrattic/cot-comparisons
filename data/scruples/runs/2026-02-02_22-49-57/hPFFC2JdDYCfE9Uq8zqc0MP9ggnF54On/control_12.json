She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.

We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from an expensive place because he was craving it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he took two pieces, left the rest, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she didn't eat. The author later found out that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because he wanted it. He shared the order with his girlfriend. She agreed to have some of it. He took two pieces, left the rest. She then modified the remaining pizza by removing toppings and cheese from every piece. He felt she was being selfish, she felt he was overreacting.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he paid for the pizza he wanted because he was craving it. He ordered it for both of them, but she didn't partake initially. When he went to get more, he found the remaining pizza altered. He might feel that she didn't consider his feelings or the expense. Maybe he thought she should have either ordered her own or communicated if she wanted a different type.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might have taken the toppings off because she prefers pizza without certain toppings. She didn't take the whole pizza, just some parts. She might feel that since the author had already taken his share, the rest was fair game. She could see her actions as reasonable, especially if she didn't like the toppings. Also, the argument might have been about communication\u2014maybe she should have mentioned her preferences earlier, but the author might have assumed she wanted some of the pizza as is.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he might have been inconsiderate by not considering her preferences when ordering. If she didn't like certain toppings, maybe he should have ordered a pizza without them or asked her what she wanted. However, she did agree to have \"some of whatever he got,\" which might imply she was okay with the toppings. Still, her modifying all the remaining pieces could be seen as disrespectful, especially if he was still planning to eat them. But the argument escalated because he called her selfish and she called him a child. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author might have a point if he expected her not to alter the pizza he paid for. But he also could have been more considerate of her preferences in the first place. On the other hand, she could have communicated her dislike for certain toppings before he ordered. Since she didn't, maybe she was inconsiderate in modifying the pizza without asking. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. He ordered the pizza he wanted, but maybe he didn't consider her preferences. However, the act of modifying the pizza after he had already taken his share might not be as wrong. The author's reaction might be over the top because it's just pizza, but he did pay for it. However, in a relationship, not considering each other's preferences can lead to issues. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the author could have also been more considerate when ordering. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's action of modifying the pizza without permission, which the author had a right to be upset about since he paid for it. So, the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted. But maybe he overreacted. Hmm. It's tricky. I think the answer is B because the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. The key is that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's anger is somewhat justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
