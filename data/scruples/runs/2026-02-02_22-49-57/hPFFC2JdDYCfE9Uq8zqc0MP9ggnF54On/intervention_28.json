It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting angry about their girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, told their girlfriend they'd order it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but would have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back. When he went to the kitchen, he found she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big fight.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared resources and expectations. The author ordered pizza intending to share, but the girlfriend took what she wanted in a way that affected the author's meal. The author feels that modifying all the pizza was inconsiderate, especially since he had already taken two pieces. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was just taking a bit, not all of the cheese, and didn't see the problem.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's actions: she did take from the pizza, but she thought she was only taking toppings from one or two pieces. However, she ended up taking from every piece. The author's frustration is understandable because the pizza is a personal craving he paid for, and modifying all the pieces makes it less enjoyable for him. The girlfriend's response that it's still fine to eat might not consider his preferences or the fact that he values the toppings.\n\nBut then there's the argument about the initial agreement. The author asked if she wanted anything, she said no, but then took part of the pizza. That could be a point of contention. Did she have permission to take from the pizza? If he had ordered it for himself but shared a couple of pieces, maybe she shouldn't have taken more without asking again. However, she might have thought since he was offering, she could take what she wanted.\n\nThe author's reaction: calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The girlfriend felt the author was overreacting. Is the author justified? It depends on the relationship dynamics. If they usually share meals and this was a one-time thing, maybe it's a misunderstanding. The author's anger might be in proportion to the value he placed on the pizza and the effort he made. However, escalating to a big argument over this could be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't intend to take all the toppings and was confused.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza without considering his preferences could be inconsiderate. If the author specifically likes the toppings and the pizza was his choice, she might have overstepped by altering it so much.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger might be reasonable given the effort and expense, but the way he escalated it to a big argument could be seen as the problem. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but her confusion and defensive response also contributed. However, the initial action of the girlfriend taking from all the pieces without permission is a key point here. The author might feel entitled to his pizza, especially if he paid for it and ordered it for himself. The girlfriend's assumption that she could take what she wanted without considering his preferences might be where the issue lies.\n\nSo, the answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was more inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the argument could also be seen as disproportionate. But given the details, the girl's action was more selfish, so B (author not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
