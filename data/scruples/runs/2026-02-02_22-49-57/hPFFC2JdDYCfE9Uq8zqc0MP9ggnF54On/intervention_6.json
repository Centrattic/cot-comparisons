It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation involves the author ordering pizza, assuming their girlfriend would take some of the leftovers, but she ended up taking toppings and cheese off all the remaining pieces.\n\nFirst, the author asked if the girlfriend wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. That seems like a mutual understanding that the pizza would be shared. When he ordered, he took two pieces, left the rest. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he checked, she had taken toppings off all the remaining pieces. The author is upset because he expected her to just take a couple of pieces or maybe some toppings from one or two, but instead, she modified all the remaining pizza, making it unusable for him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend didn't clarify that she wanted to take only toppings, not the entire pieces. The author assumed she would take some pieces or part of them, but she did something different without explaining. However, the author also didn't check on the pizza before eating his own pieces. Maybe he should have made sure she had what she needed. But the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all remaining pieces could be seen as inconsiderate if she knew the author wanted to eat the rest later.\n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling that the girlfriend was selfish, which might be a valid reaction if he had a specific craving and she altered the food without considering his needs. However, the girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by taking only what she needed (toppings) and leaving the crusts, but that's not how it came across. The argument escalated because of differing expectations and a lack of communication.\n\nIn such situations, it's important to consider both sides. The author might not be entirely wrong because he had a legitimate need for the pizza and expected it to be shared. However, he could have communicated better about his expectations. The girlfriend also should have discussed her intentions instead of acting unilaterally. But given that the author was clear about his need and the girlfriend's actions disrupted that, the fault might lie more with her. However, the author's reaction as calling her selfish and the argument leading to bringing up past issues might indicate that his response was excessive. So, while the initial action might not be his fault, the way the argument escalated could be his responsibility. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong for starting the fight, the core issue is his anger over the pizza situation. Given the context, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because his reaction is based on unmet expectations that the girlfriend didn't clarify.\n"
