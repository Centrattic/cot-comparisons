It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The user ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it, and the girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he ordered. He took two pieces and went to watch TV, while she was in the kitchen. When he checked, he found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thought he was ordering for himself and offered her something. She agreed to have some of the pizza. He ordered, ate his two pieces, and then found that she had been eating the pizza in a way he didn't expect. The problem is that she took the toppings off all the pieces, making them less appealing for him. But why didn't she just take a piece if she wanted some? The author might feel that since he ordered it, it's his, and she shouldn't have messed with the remaining pieces. However, the girlfriend's side is that she didn't take all the cheese, just some toppings, and she thought it was okay because he had already eaten his share.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the pizza whole; he just ordered it for himself and offered her some. She took the pizza in a way that he didn't expect, which led to frustration. But did he have a right to be angry? Maybe he should have discussed how they would share the pizza before ordering. On the other hand, she might have assumed that since he ordered it, he would have wanted to eat it as is. The fact that he was willing to share by offering her something, but then she altered the remaining pizza could be seen as inconsiderate. However, getting angry over this might be overreacting. It's just pizza, and maybe the argument escalated because of other underlying issues. \n\nBut the user's side is that she was being selfish by taking toppings off all the pieces instead of just taking a piece herself. The author might think that by saving the remaining pizza for himself, he had a right to have it intact. The girlfriend's action made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. So, is the author wrong for being upset? Well, it's a judgment call. If the author had communicated that he wanted to keep the pizza whole, maybe she would have known. But he didn't specify. However, she did take more than just a piece, which is more than just eating it in a way that affects his leftovers. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could be at fault. The author didn't clarify his expectations, and she didn't consider that altering the pizza might affect him. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is angry because she took the toppings off without considering his preferences, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if he expected her to just take a piece, then she didn't do that. However, the argument might have been about his reaction being too strong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the argument could have been avoided with better communication. But it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the user thinks the author is not wrong, I might lean towards B.\n"
