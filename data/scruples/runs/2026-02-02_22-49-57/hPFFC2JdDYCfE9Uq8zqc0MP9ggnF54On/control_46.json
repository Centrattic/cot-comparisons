It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering expensive pizza, expecting their girlfriend to take some, but then she ends up taking toppings off every slice. They argue, and the author feels justified in getting angry, while the girlfriend sees it as an overreaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author ordered pizza intending to share, and when the girlfriend took toppings off every piece, they felt it was inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she could take some toppings without it being a big deal, assuming the author had already taken their share.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched, so maybe they should have been clearer. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces might be seen as taking from the shared food without considering the owner's preference. \n\nIn relationships, people have different expectations about sharing. The author might have expected the pizza to be shared whole, while the girlfriend took it as she wanted. The argument escalated because of these differing expectations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they didn't communicate their preference, they might share some responsibility. But the girlfriend's action of taking from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author didn't state it explicitly. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's anger over something trivial like pizza could be seen as overreacting, but if they value their food and felt disrespected, their reaction might be justified. However, the initial lack of clear communication from the author could mean they're not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps not entirely right either.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the girlfriend was confused and didn't think it was a big deal. The author called her selfish, which the girlfriend found childish. The question is whether the author's anger is proportionate. Since the pizza was ordered for sharing, the girlfriend might have a right to partake, but removing toppings from all pieces might be excessive. \n\nIn many cases, people might prefer others not to alter shared food without discussion. The author might have a point, but their reaction could be seen as over the top. However, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while heated, is a response to that inconsiderate act. But there's also a part where the author could have communicated their preference better. However, given the scenario's details, the main issue is the girlfriend's action, so the answer is B.\n"
