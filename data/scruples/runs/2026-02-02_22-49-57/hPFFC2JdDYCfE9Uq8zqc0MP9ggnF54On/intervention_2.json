It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is a bit expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever they got. Then the author ordered it, ate two slices, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, she didn't eat. The author asked why, and she said she took toppings off because she only wanted some. The author didn't realize until they went to the kitchen and saw that she took toppings and cheese off every piece. The girlfriend was confused why the author was angry, saying she didn't take all the cheese, and the author called her selfish. The argument escalated.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know the assistant's take. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author ordered the pizza because they were hungry and specifically wanted that place. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever the author got, which the author interpreted as maybe wanting a slice or two. But instead, the girlfriend modified all the pizza pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. The author felt angry because the pizza was their main meal, and the girlfriend's actions made it less enjoyable. The girlfriend didn't think it was a big deal and accused the author of overreacting.\n\nNow, considering communication issues. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said no. The author assumed she was okay with sharing, but maybe the girlfriend had different expectations. When she came out and didn't eat, the author didn't check in again. The girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, which was a big deal for the author. Was the author's reaction justified?\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate because she modified the pizza the author had paid for, especially since it was a premium pizza they were excited about. However, the author could have communicated their expectations better. Maybe they should have clarified that they wanted to eat their own slices without interference. On the other hand, the girlfriend did take the toppings, which changed the meal the author had prepared for themselves. The argument might have been avoidable if they had discussed it before the action, but the girlfriend's behavior seems selfish. The author's anger is about their personal meal being altered without consent, which is a valid concern. However, the initial assumption was that they were sharing, so maybe the girlfriend thought she could have leftovers. But taking toppings off all pieces is excessive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have miscommunicated. The author didn't specify that they wanted to eat the pizza as is, and the girlfriend didn't ask for permission before altering it. However, the girlfriend's action was more inconsiderate because she changed the meal the author had specifically ordered. The author's reaction was an emotional response to something they valued. It's possible the author overreacted in the heat of the moment, but the core issue is about respecting each other's preferences and boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's anger is about their meal being altered without consent, which is a valid point. The girlfriend's action was selfish. However, the author could have been clearer about their expectations. But given that the girlfriend took the toppings without asking, the author isn't entirely wrong. The question is whether their anger was disproportionate. Since the pizza was a significant purchase and the modification affected the entire meal, the author's reaction might be justified. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
