It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza situation. So first, I need to understand the scenario clearly.\n\nThe author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two slices, and when he checked the kitchen, she had removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. The author assumed she meant she might take a slice or maybe take toppings from one or two slices. However, she took toppings off every single piece, which the author found inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's perspective is that she didn't communicate her intention to take toppings from all the pizza, leading to him feeling his meal was ruined. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought it was fine because the author had already taken his slices and didn't mind her actions. She might have considered it her way of having some of the pizza without eating a whole slice.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. Anger over someone modifying his ordered meal without prior agreement could be seen as overreacting. However, if the author explicitly said he wanted that specific pizza and she agreed to share, but then she altered it in a way that affected his enjoyment, maybe he has a point. The problem here is the lack of communication. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza as ordered, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her actions. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author took two slices first, and the girlfriend took the remaining toppings. If the pizza was ordered as a shared meal, maybe the author should have considered that. However, the girlfriend modifying all the remaining pizza without consent might be the main issue. The author's anger comes from feeling that his meal was altered without his permission. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't set clear boundaries about how the pizza should be handled, and the girlfriend didn't ask before taking toppings. Both might share some responsibility. However, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and starting a fight might be disproportionate. The value of the pizza and the emotional response might not match the situation's severity. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she knew the author really wanted that pizza. But if the author had already eaten his share, maybe she felt entitled to the leftovers. However, modifying the food in a way that affects the remaining pizza might still be an issue. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's anger is based on unspoken expectations. He didn't clarify his needs, and she didn't ask. But the fight over such a minor issue might indicate that the author is overreacting, especially since it's just pizza. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because starting a big argument over something trivial without clear communication could be seen as his fault. However, some might argue the girlfriend was inconsiderate, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n"
