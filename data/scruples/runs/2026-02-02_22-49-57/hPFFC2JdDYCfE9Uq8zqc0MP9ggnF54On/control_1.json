It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her a share. She said she'd have some of whatever they got. He ate two pieces, then went back to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a long time, and when he checked, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. She thought he was overreacting.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author ordered the pizza for themselves but shared it with their partner. The partner, instead of taking a piece or part of one, removed toppings from all pieces. The author feels that's selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend sees it as not a big deal.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author did order the pizza, but they did offer to share. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces might be seen as taking without considering the owner's preference. However, the author did eat two pieces first, leaving the rest. Maybe they should have discussed how they wanted to share the pizza beforehand. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach might be inconsiderate, but the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion\u2014could be seen as overreacting. The argument escalated, bringing up other issues. The author might be at fault for being too harsh, especially since it's just pizza. But the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pieces could be seen as disrespectful to the author's order. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had a specific craving and paid for the pizza. The girlfriend, while expressing interest in sharing, didn't clarify her needs and then altered the pizza in a way that ruined the author's experience. However, the author could have been more communicative about their expectations for sharing. \n\nIn terms of the argument, the author's anger might be justified by the action, but the way they reacted could be seen as excessive. The girlfriend's confusion and the author's use of strong language (\"fucking,\" \"selfish\") might contribute to the argument being blown out of proportion. \n\nSo, the balance here is tricky. The author might not be entirely wrong, as their partner did something that affected their meal. However, they could have handled the situation better without escalating it. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response might have been disproportionate. \n\nBut according to the question, is the author in the wrong? The decision is between A (yes) and B (no). If the author's anger was a legitimate response to someone altering their meal without consent, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the author overreacted, then A. \n\nI think the key is the author's right to be upset about their meal being altered, but their reaction was harsh. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. The author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
