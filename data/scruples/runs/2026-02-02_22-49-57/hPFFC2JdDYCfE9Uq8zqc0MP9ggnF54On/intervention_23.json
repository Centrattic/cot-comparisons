It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza they were craving, told their girlfriend, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. The author ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while and came back not eating. When the author asked, she said she took toppings off all the pieces, not just one or two as the author thought. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. The author ordered pizza they were really craving, which was more expensive but worth it. The girlfriend said she'd have some of his pizza, which led the author to think maybe she'd take a piece or just some toppings. But instead, she took a lot of toppings off every piece, which the author saw as taking without consideration. The author felt justified in being angry because they thought she was being selfish, but she thought it wasn't a big deal.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, let's see. The author did order the pizza and expected to have it for themselves, but when they shared it (by offering her something), there might be an expectation that she would take a reasonable amount. The girlfriend took a lot, even though the author had already eaten some. The author's anger might be over the fact that the pizza was a personal order, not meant to be shared beyond what was offered. But maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the extent of what she did. She thought it was okay to take toppings, but the author felt it was taking too much. The line here is about communication and expectations. Did the author make their expectations clear? They said she could have some of whatever they got, which might be interpreted as a small amount. The girlfriend took more than that, possibly without realizing. The author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate, but the girlfriend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but perhaps they overreacted. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have been unclear on the terms. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author initiated the fight, but the reason might be valid if they felt their belongings (pizza) were being taken in a way they didn't agree to. However, pizza is a shared order once placed, especially if they live together. So maybe the author's ownership over the pizza is not absolute. The girlfriend took what she wanted, and the author got upset. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not clarifying how much they wanted to share. Alternatively, the girlfriend should have asked before taking a lot. It's a bit of a gray area. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to decide. If the pizza was ordered with the intention that the girlfriend could have some, but she took more than that, maybe she's wrong. But the author's reaction might be too harsh. However, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't wrong because the girlfriend did take a lot without asking. So answer B.\n"
