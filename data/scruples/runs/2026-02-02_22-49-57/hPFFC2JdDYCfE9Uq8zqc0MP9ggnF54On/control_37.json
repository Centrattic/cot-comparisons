It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong over a pizza incident. The situation involves the author ordering a specific, expensive pizza they were craving, asking their girlfriend if she wanted anything, which she declined. Then, upon serving, the girlfriend ended up taking toppings off every piece, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author ordered the pizza for themselves but allowed the girlfriend to have some. The girlfriend, however, didn't take a piece but instead took toppings off all the pieces. The author feels this is selfish, while the girlfriend thinks it's not a big deal.\n\nThe key points are consent and communication. The author ordered the pizza, assuming it was for both, but the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces might be seen as taking without permission. However, the author didn't explicitly state that the pizza was off-limits. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted from the shared food.\n\nEmotional context matters too. The author was craving the pizza and chose a more expensive option, which might make them more sensitive about how it's consumed. The girlfriend didn't want a whole piece but didn't clarify her need for specific toppings. The author's frustration could be about the destruction of their desired meal, while the girlfriend might see it as sharing.\n\nIs the author wrong for getting angry? It's subjective. The argument started because of communication breakdowns. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched, and the girlfriend didn't ask for toppings. However, the girlfriend did take without asking, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author's response\u2014calling her selfish and inconsiderate, escalating to a big argument\u2014might be overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't take all the pizza just the toppings. So, the author's anger is understandable but maybe disproportionate. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the argument's escalation might have been the author's fault for not addressing it calmly first. So, the answer might be a balance, but since the options are A or B, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting, or not for being reasonable. Need to decide based on typical AITA standards where both sides often have some fault, but sometimes one is more at fault. In this case, maybe the girlfriend is more at fault for taking without asking, making the author's reaction justified. But the argument went too far, so the author's part in escalating it could make them partially wrong. Hmm. The answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. Alternatively, maybe the author is wrong for blowing it out of proportion. The girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza, just toppings. The author's anger over that could be excessive. So, maybe A.\n"
