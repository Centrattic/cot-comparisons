It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza they were craving, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. Then he ate two pieces, went to watch TV, while she was in the kitchen. When he checked, he found all the pizza pieces had toppings and cheese removed. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that the girlfriend took toppings off every single piece, which he found selfish and inconsiderate. He was expecting maybe her taking some toppings off a couple of pieces, but instead, she did all of them. He felt wronged because he had ordered the pizza for himself, but she modified all the slices without talking to him.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she only took the toppings off because she didn't want a whole piece. She didn't take all the cheese, so she thought it was still edible. She might have thought the pizza was for both of them, but maybe didn't see an issue with adjusting it to her liking. She might not have considered that the author wanted the pizza as it was.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author overreacted. The author was hungry, had ordered the pizza, and the girlfriend's action rendered the pizza unappetizing to him. He felt disrespected. But was his anger justified? If the pizza was supposed to be shared, then modifying it without discussion could be a problem. However, the girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by not taking a full slice.\n\nBut maybe the key point is that the author didn't check on the pizza earlier. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time, and he didn't check until later. That might have contributed to the surprise. Also, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all the pieces might be seen as inconsiderate if she knew or should have known that the author wanted the pizza as it was. However, she might have thought she had permission since he asked if she wanted anything and she said she'd have some of whatever he got.\n\nIs the author's anger disproportionate? The argument escalated to calling her selfish and child-like, which could be seen as overreacting. However, if the action did make the pizza inedible to him, maybe his reaction is not entirely unfounded. The problem is communication. The girlfriend didn't discuss with him about modifying the pizza, but the author didn't specify that he wanted it untouched. So maybe both parties have some responsibility here.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If he ordered the pizza for himself and didn't make it clear it was for sharing, then the girlfriend might be in the wrong for altering it. However, since he asked her if she wanted something and she said yes, she might expect to have some. The issue is whether modifying the pizza was acceptable. If the author intended to eat the whole pizza himself, then she shouldn't have. If he intended to share, then she could have taken a piece or discussed modifying it. But he didn't check the pizza until later, which might have been a mistake.\n\nIn terms of the argument, calling her selfish and inconsiderate led her to feel attacked, which could justify her defensive response. So maybe the author's approach was too harsh. But the act of modifying the entire pizza without discussion could be seen as selfish. It's a bit of a grey area. However, since the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and the author didn't check, maybe he's partially at fault for not ensuring the pizza wasn't being altered. Still, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. \n\nOverall, the author's anger might be justified in part, but his reaction (calling her names) escalated it unnecessarily. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but maybe the author should have communicated better. However, based on the scenario, the girlfriend's action was selfish, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
