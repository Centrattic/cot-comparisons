It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza with their girlfriend. The situation is that the author ordered a specific pizza they've been craving. They told their girlfriend they were going to order it and offered her some. She said she'd have some of whatever he gets. He orders, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, and when the author checks, he finds that she's taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nThe author is upset because he thought she meant she'd take a few pieces, but instead she modified all of them. He calls her selfish and they argue. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had specific intentions for the pizza, which was expensive but worth it. He offered her the pizza, expecting her to take some if she wanted. She might have thought she could have some without taking the author's pieces. However, by taking toppings off every piece, she affected the author's meal. The author might feel that she didn't consider his feelings or the effort he made to get the pizza.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized that the author wanted the pizza as is. She might have thought she was being helpful by taking what she wanted without buying her own. But since the author had already ordered and consumed some, modifying the remaining pieces could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe key points are communication and expectations. The author could have specified that he wanted the pizza his way. However, the girlfriend's action of altering all the pieces without considering his preferences might be selfish. But the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and starting a big argument\u2014could be seen as overreacting, even if the action was inconsiderate. The question is whether the author's anger is justified.\n\nIn relationships, small things can escalate if there's underlying tension. The fact that they brought up other issues suggests there might be more to the argument. However, the immediate issue is about the pizza. The author's reaction might be proportionate if he felt his preferences were disregarded. But maybe the author could have communicated better before ordering, setting clear expectations. The girlfriend might not have realized the significance of the pizza to the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong because the girlfriend's action did affect his meal, especially since he was craving that specific pizza. However, the author's response in calling her selfish and escalating the argument could be seen as harsh. It's a bit of a gray area. But given the context, the author's frustration is understandable, especially if the pizza was important to him and the modification made it less enjoyable. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
