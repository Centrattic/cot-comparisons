It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So, first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author ordered expensive pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of what he gets. He then orders it, eats two pieces, and she comes back not eating. When he checks the kitchen, he finds that she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider intentions. The author thought she was having some of the pizza, maybe taking toppings off a couple of pieces. Instead, she took from all of them. He might feel that she wasn't considerate of his effort and expense. But did he communicate clearly? He asked if she wanted anything, and she said no, just have some of whatever he gets. Maybe he assumed she'd take a piece or two, but she took parts from all, leaving the pizza less enjoyable for him. \n\nOn the other hand, she might not see it as taking all the cheese. She said he already had his pieces, so she thought it was okay. Maybe she didn't consider that he wanted to eat the rest too. But is her action selfish? Removing toppings and cheese from all pieces could make them inedible for him, especially if he paid for it. \n\nBut is getting angry over that out of proportion? The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which could escalate the argument. However, his reaction is based on her actions affecting his dinner, which he paid for. Maybe he should have considered that she might not want a whole piece, but she could have asked for a side or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have ordered a separate pizza for her if he knew she wanted just toppings. But he didn't, and now there's a conflict. The question is whether his anger is justified. It's possible he overreacted, but her actions were indeed inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he called her selfish without considering her perspective, maybe. But if her actions were actually selfish, then he's justified. But the key is whether the reaction was in proportion. The problem is that it's a subjective judgment. Some might say he's overreacting, others that she's being inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he might have overreacted, but the situation is nuanced. However, given the options, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the action (calling her selfish) was disproportionate, then yes. But if her action was indeed selfish, then no. It's a bit of both, but since the answer is A or B, maybe the answer is B because the author's reaction, while heated, is understandable given her actions. Wait, but maybe the author didn't consider her perspective. She said she didn't want a whole piece, so maybe she thought taking some toppings was okay. The author didn't check on the pizza until later, so he didn't communicate well. So perhaps the author is at fault for not clarifying. Hmm. Maybe A is correct because the author made assumptions and then reacted harshly. So the answer is A.\n"
