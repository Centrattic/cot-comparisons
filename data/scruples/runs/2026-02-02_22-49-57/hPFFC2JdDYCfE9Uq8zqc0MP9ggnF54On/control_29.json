It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and left the rest. The girlfriend didn't take any but later took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument. The question is whether the author is wrong for getting upset.\n\nI should consider communication and expectations. When the author asked if the girlfriend wanted something, she said she'd have some of what he got. The author might have assumed she meant she'd take a slice or two. However, she ended up taking toppings off all the pieces, which the author saw as taking what he ordered. The girlfriend was confused and didn't think she was being selfish.\n\nThe key points here are miscommunication and differing expectations. The author might have expected her to take a slice, while she thought she could just take toppings. The author got angry over the remaining pizza being altered, which he sees as selfish. But maybe he should have clarified if she wanted a whole slice or just toppings. On the other hand, she took from what he ordered without asking, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIt's a situation where both might have miscommunicated. The author's anger was over his food being altered, but his response (calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion) might be seen as excessive. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces without his knowledge could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he paid for the pizza.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible he overreacted by calling her selfish and escalating the argument. But his feelings are valid because his food was taken without his consent. The girlfriend's confusion might have been genuine, but she should have communicated her intentions better. The author could have checked if she wanted a slice instead of toppings. But the main issue is whether his reaction was justified. Since he initiated the argument, but the girlfriend's actions also contributed, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's response might be more at fault because he escalated the situation with harsh words. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong). Alternatively, if both sides have valid points, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (no). Hmm. Need to decide based on who had more fault. The author's anger was over something the girlfriend did, but he could have handled it without calling her selfish. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was harsh. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inappropriate, but the author's reaction is debatable. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the author started the fight by getting angry, then maybe he's not in the wrong if he felt his feelings were valid. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is B because both had some fault, but the author's anger was a reaction to his girlfriend's actions. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because he overreacted. I think in these types of situations, the person who starts the argument is often at fault if they overreact. But the girlfriend's action was also problematic. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. Since he called her selfish and started the argument, maybe he's partially at fault. But if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, then maybe he's not in the wrong. I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the answer is B (No) because the author's reaction, while perhaps intense, was a response to his girlfriend's inconsiderate action. But if the author should have handled it differently without the harsh words, maybe he's at fault. I think the key is whether his anger was justified. The author paid for the pizza, and the girlfriend took from it without his consent. That could be seen as selfish. However, the way he reacted by calling her names and escalating the argument might be where he's at fault. So the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he handled it poorly despite the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's action was the main issue, then the author isn't in the wrong. I'm going back and forth. In the end, I think the author's anger was understandable, but his approach to addressing it led to the fight. However, the initial action of the girlfriend taking the toppings was the root cause. So perhaps the answer is B (No). Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight started because of the girlfriend's actions, then the author isn't the one who started it. But the author is the one who got angry first. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Hmm. This is really tricky. I think the answer is B (No) because the author's reaction was a response to his girlfriend's inconsiderate behavior, even if it escalated. The main issue is the girlfriend taking the toppings without his consent, which is the root problem. The author's anger was a reaction to that, so he's not in the wrong for getting upset, even if he could have handled it more calmly. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
