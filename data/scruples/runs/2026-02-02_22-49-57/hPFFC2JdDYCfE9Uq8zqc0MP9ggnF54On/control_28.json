It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. Then he orders, eats two pieces, and when he goes to the kitchen, he finds that she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, let me break it down. Did he do anything wrong first? He asked her if she wanted something, she said she'd have some of what he got. So he ordered. Then he ate two pieces. She wasn't there for a while but came back and started eating, then later in the kitchen she took toppings off all the pieces. \n\nThe key points here: Did she have a right to take toppings from the pizza he ordered? The author might feel that since he ordered the pizza and she agreed to have some of what he gets, that he's the one who paid for it and she shouldn't have altered the pizza without discussing it. On the other hand, maybe she thought it was shared since he offered. But she didn't take one or two pieces, she took toppings off every piece. That seems excessive. \n\nHe got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The girlfriend's response was confusion and then annoyance, calling him a child. So, whose side is more justified? The author's anger might stem from feeling that his meal was ruined, especially since it was a specific, expensive pizza. But maybe he shouldn't have reacted so harshly, using a strong word like \"selfish\" and starting an argument. \n\nAlternatively, she might have overstepped by taking toppings from all the pizza without communicating. If it was just a small amount, maybe it's not a big deal, but removing chunks of cheese from every piece could make the pizza inedible for him. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. He ordered without checking if she wanted to order her own, but she agreed to have some of what he gets, so maybe she expected to share. However, her action of taking toppings off all the pieces was unkind and disrespectful of his order. His reaction was maybe a bit strong, but given the context of craving that pizza and it being expensive, he's not entirely wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong because he ordered pizza knowing she'd be eating some, but didn't consider that she might not like the toppings. Alternatively, he could have ordered two different pizzas. However, since she agreed to his choice, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key is whether his anger was justified. If she took from the pizza he was eating, that's one thing, but she took toppings from all, which he might not have wanted. His reaction was immediate anger, which might be too harsh, but her actions were inconsiderate. \n\nSo, in this case, it's a bit of a grey area. But the main question is if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend took toppings from all the pizza he paid for, that's a problem. However, the way the author reacted could also be seen as overreacting. But given that she didn't just take one piece but altered all of them, maybe the author's anger is understandable. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they both have some blame. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he called her selfish and they argued, maybe he's at fault for starting the fight. But the initial issue was her taking the toppings. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because her actions were inconsiderate. But maybe A because he could have handled it better. It's tricky. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the fight was over a legitimate grievance (her taking toppings from all pizza he paid for), then he's not in the wrong. But if he overreacted, then maybe A. The user says \"starting a fight over pizza,\" but if the other person did something wrong, then he's not starting the fight without cause. So I think the answer is B.\n"
