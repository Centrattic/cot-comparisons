It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering a specific pizza they were craving, and their girlfriend taking toppings and cheese off all the pieces instead of just one or two. They ended up arguing, and the author is wondering if their anger was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend said she wanted to have some of whatever pizza the author gets. The author thought that meant she might take toppings off a couple of pieces, but instead, she removed toppings and cheese from every piece. The author got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument. The girlfriend was confused and thought the author was overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author had a specific craving and chose a particular pizza. They asked if the girlfriend wanted anything, and she declined but implied she would eat from what the author ordered. When the author went to get more pizza, they found all the pieces altered. The issue here is the misunderstanding. The girlfriend didn't communicate her intention to take from all the pieces, and the author assumed she would only take a few. That's a classic case of miscommunication. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to be upset? Well, the author paid for the pizza, which was a specific choice they were excited about. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all the pieces might have spoiled the experience for the author, making each slice less enjoyable. However, the reaction escalated into a fight, which might be seen as disproportionate if the main issue was just the pizza. The girlfriend didn't take all the cheese off, but some, so the author could still eat the pizza, albeit not as they wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was trying to take from the pizza without causing harm, maybe thinking it was a shared meal. But she didn't clarify her needs or consider how her actions would affect the author's enjoyment. The author's frustration is understandable because their personal choice was altered without consideration. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting angry? The girlfriend's actions, while inconsiderate, were based on a misunderstanding. The author could have communicated their preference for the pizza to be left as ordered, especially if they were aware of their girlfriend's tendency to take from others' food. However, the girlfriend's behavior of taking from all the pieces without asking again might be selfish, so the author's reaction isn't entirely misplaced. \n\nIn terms of argument escalation, the author might have overreacted by calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate right away. Maybe addressing the situation calmly could have resolved it without a fight. The girlfriend's confusion and her reaction of calling the author a child suggest that both parties have valid points but handled the conflict poorly. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would depend on the relationship dynamics. If the girlfriend often takes things without considering others, then the author's frustration is justified. But if this is an isolated incident, the author might have been too harsh. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they acted on a misunderstanding and their reaction escalated the situation, there's a chance they overreacted, but the initial grievance isn't completely unfounded. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author's reaction is based on a genuine feeling of being disrespected. The girlfriend didn't ask again after the initial request and altered the pizza in a way that affected the author's experience. However, the author could have approached the situation more calmly. But the core issue is the girlfriend's inconsiderate action, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
