It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place, expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but would have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while. When he went back, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author ordered the pizza intending to share, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her needs. She might have thought it was okay to take bits from the pizza without asking. But on the other hand, the author might have expected the pizza to be available for both of them as they discussed. The girlfriend's action could be seen as inconsiderate because she didn't ask and took what she wanted without considering the author's feelings. However, the author did take two pieces for himself first, so maybe he should have left some for her or communicated better about sharing. But the main issue is that the girlfriend didn't inform him about her actions and took what she wanted, which could be seen as selfish. The author's anger might be justified if he felt his choice was undermined. But pizza is a shared food, so maybe the girlfriend was trying to have a bit without being wasteful. However, the way she did it without discussion could lead to conflict. The author's reaction might be a bit over the top, but given the context, maybe not entirely wrong. It's a tricky situation where both parties might have miscommunicated. The key is whether the author's anger was disproportionate. The girlfriend didn't take all the pizza, just bits. The author called her selfish, which might be harsh, but the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
