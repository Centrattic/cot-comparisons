It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were craving pizza from a specific place and ordered it. They offered their girlfriend some, and she said she'd have some of whatever they ordered. Then the author ate two pieces, went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time. When she came back, she didn't eat, but later the author found out she took toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen.\n\nThe author got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The girlfriend was confused and thought it was fine since she didn't take all the cheese. The author feels justified in being angry over her actions.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and expectations. The author expected that since the girlfriend said she wanted some, she would take maybe a piece or two. But instead, she took toppings off all the pieces. The author might have assumed that the pizza was for both, so using up all the toppings in a way that made the remaining pizza less good for the author could be seen as selfish.\n\nBut wait, the author ordered the pizza intending to share. When they asked if she wanted anything, she said she'd have some, so maybe she expected to take a piece or two. Instead, she modified all the pieces, which might not have been clear to her what the author wanted. However, maybe the author should have checked if she wanted a specific type before eating their own pieces. Also, the author ate two pieces first, then went to the living room. Maybe they should have communicated better about how they wanted to split the pizza.\n\nBut the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate because it affects the author's ability to enjoy the pizza as they wanted. The author's anger over that might be understandable if they felt their preferences were disregarded. However, the argument escalated, and the author used harsh words like \"selfish\" and \"child,\" which could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend was confused and maybe didn't realize the impact of her actions.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? They might have a point in feeling that the girlfriend didn't consider their enjoyment of the pizza, but their reaction could have been more constructive. However, the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate. But maybe the author could have communicated their preferences better beforehand. It's a bit of a grey area. If the girlfriend didn't realize the pizza was meant to be shared in a specific way, then maybe the author should have clarified. But if the author expected that the pizza was for both and the modifications ruined it for them, then the girlfriend's action was selfish. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then the author isn't wrong to be upset. However, the way they expressed it might have been harsh. But the core issue is the girlfriend's action. The author might not be entirely at fault here because the girlfriend did act selfishly. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about someone else's selfishness, even if the reaction was strong. But maybe there's a nuance where the author could have handled it better without escalating. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's action was indeed inconsiderate, then the author's reaction is justified. \n\nI think the key is whether the author overreacted. The girlfriend took toppings off all pieces, which is not just taking a piece but altering the pizza in a way that affects how the author eats it. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they confronted her might have been harsh. However, the initial action of the girlfriend was inconsiderate. So the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe could have handled it better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend did something selfish and the author got angry over it, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for being upset about someone else's selfishness. Alternatively, maybe the author is at fault for not clarifying before eating their own pieces. Hmm, but the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time, which the author didn't think was unusual. Maybe the author should have checked on the pizza earlier. But the main issue is the girlfriend altering all the pizza after the author had their two pieces. So the author's anger is about the remaining pizza being ruined for them. The girlfriend's action was selfish, so the author isn't wrong in being upset. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
