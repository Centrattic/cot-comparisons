It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The guy ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and his girlfriend took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got mad, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nHmm, first, he told her he was starving and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, just some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two slices, and when he went to get more, found she had taken toppings off all the pieces. He got angry, she was confused. He called her inconsiderate, she said he was overreacting.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Let's break it down. Did he have a right to get angry? Well, he paid for the pizza, right? Or did they split the cost? The post says he ordered it because he was starving and asked her if she wanted some. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. So maybe she expected him to share, but he ate two slices first. Maybe he should have considered that she might want more than just a few toppings from the remaining slices.\n\nBut then she took toppings off every single piece. That seems like a big deal. If he wanted to eat the pizza as it was, she altered it in a way that might make it inedible for him. He might have felt that was disrespectful or selfish. But on the flip side, he did eat two slices first, so there's some responsibility there. Maybe he should have checked if she wanted any more before finishing the pizza.\n\nWait, the problem says he asked her if she wanted anything when he ordered. She said no, just some of whatever he got. So he ordered, ate two, then went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a long time, then came back and didn't eat. He asked why, she said she didn't take a whole piece. He thought she took toppings off one or two, but she did all of them. So he was surprised. Maybe he should have offered to share more, but she might have expected to take what she wanted from the remaining pizza.\n\nBut altering the pizza like that could be seen as going too far. If she just wanted toppings, maybe she could have asked for some. But she took them off without asking. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong in getting angry. However, he did eat two slices first without knowing she would want more. So maybe he's partially responsible.\n\nThe question is whether his anger was justified. The user says he's not wrong, but what's the balance here? It's hard to say. The act of taking toppings off all the pieces is pretty destructive, but he might have not set clear expectations. Maybe he should have specified not to mess with the pizza. Alternatively, she should have communicated better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe both have some fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A or B, either yes or no. The user thinks the author is not wrong. I think the answer might be B (No), because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been too harsh. But it's a close call. However, the key point is that she altered the pizza he ordered without his consent, which is disrespectful. So the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
