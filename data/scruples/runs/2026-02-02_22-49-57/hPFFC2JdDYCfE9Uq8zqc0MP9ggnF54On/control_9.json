It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering expensive pizza they really wanted, and their girlfriend ending up taking toppings and cheese off all the pieces. The author got upset, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were craving pizza from a specific place, which was more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then, when the pizza arrived, the author ate two pieces, assuming she might take toppings off a couple. But instead, she took toppings off every piece, which the author found inconsiderate. The girlfriend was confused by their anger, saying the author already had their pieces and it's still eatable. The author felt justified in being upset because of the girlfriend's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might be seen as not respecting the author's request. She agreed to have some of what he got but ended up modifying all the pizza, which could be seen as selfish. However, maybe she didn't realize the extent of the author's craving or the expense. The argument escalated because the author called her selfish and she felt the author was overreacting.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and expectations. The author did ask if she wanted anything, and she said no, she'd have some of whatever. The author might have expected her to take maybe a couple of pieces or just some toppings off a few, but she went further. However, the author didn't specify that they wanted to eat the pizza as is, or that they were buying it for themselves with the understanding that she might take some. Since the author paid for it and had the main craving, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author could have been more clear about their expectations. However, the girlfriend didn't ask for permission to take toppings off all the pieces. The argument might have been avoidable if there was better communication. \n\nBut the author's reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument, might be disproportionate. However, given that the author was very specific about their craving and the expense, maybe their reaction is understandable. The girlfriend's confusion and not acknowledging the author's feelings could also contribute to the problem. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, both could have communicated better. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The author's anger might be justified because their request was not respected. However, the way they handled it (calling her selfish) might escalate things. But the main issue is whether the action (starting the fight) was wrong. The author's anger was a reaction to the girlfriend's action, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the girlfriend's actions were the initial problem. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were the main issue, and the author's reaction, while heated, was a response to her inconsiderate behavior.\n"
