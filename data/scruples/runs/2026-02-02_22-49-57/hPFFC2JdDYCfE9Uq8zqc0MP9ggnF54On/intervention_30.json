It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the author ordered expensive pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, then later went to the kitchen and found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm, so the key points here: Did the author do something wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nHe ordered pizza as a treat because he was craving it, which is understandable. He offered her some, and she accepted by saying she'd have some. Then, instead of taking a piece for herself, she took toppings off all the pieces. That seems odd. Why would she do that? Maybe she didn't like the toppings? But if she wanted to eat some, taking toppings off all the pieces might be inconsiderate because it reduces the value of the pizza for the person who paid for it. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because he paid for the pizza and was looking forward to eating it as it was. She modified it without asking, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, maybe there's more context. Did she mention not liking certain toppings earlier? Did she have dietary restrictions? If not, then her actions were inconsiderate.\n\nBut the author's reaction: calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. Is that overreacting? Well, the pizza was a special treat, so maybe he was more invested in it. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought since the author had already taken two pieces, she could use the remaining pizza as she liked. However, modifying all the pieces without asking is a problem. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The girlfriend didn't ask if she could alter the pizza. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza as is. But the author's anger over the situation might be a bit strong, but not entirely wrong. She did take the pizza he paid for and changed it without consent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His reaction is based on his investment in the pizza he paid for. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
