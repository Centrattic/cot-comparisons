It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is a bit pricey but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever they got. So the author ordered the pizza.\n\nThen, the author took two slices and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When she came back, she hadn't eaten anything. The author asked why, and she said she took toppings and some cheese off every single piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The girlfriend thought the author was overreacting.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author assumed that the girlfriend would take toppings from one or two pieces, but instead, she removed toppings from all pieces. That might have made the author feel that their order wasn't respected. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole piece and just having some toppings, which she thought was okay.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend didn't ask if she could do that. She just took it upon herself to modify the pizza. The author might have felt that their personal order was being altered without consent, which could be frustrating. However, the argument escalated because the author called the girlfriend names and acted like a child, as the girlfriend pointed out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's frustration is understandable if they felt their order was being tampered with. However, the way they reacted\u2014calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, and escalating into a big argument\u2014might be where they went overboard. The girlfriend didn't take all the pizza, just some of it, and she thought it was still fine to eat. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate if the main issue was about a small act that didn't affect their own consumption much.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her actions beforehand. If she wanted to take toppings, she should have asked or discussed it. But the author's anger might have been more about the principle of someone altering their order without permission, even if the act itself wasn't malicious. However, the argument's escalation and the use of harsh language would make the author at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed the situation calmly instead of lashing out. The girlfriend also could have been more considerate of the author's preferences. But since the question is about the author's fault, the fact that they reacted angrily and called their partner names would likely make them at fault for starting the fight. So, the answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit torn because the situation is a bit of a gray area. However, the key is the reaction, not just the action. The author's response was excessive, so they are in the wrong.\n"
