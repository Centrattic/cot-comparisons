It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever he gets. Then he eats two pieces and goes to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, she hasn't eaten. The author finds out she took toppings and cheese off every piece, which upsets him. He calls her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that \"some of the toppings\" meant taking a bit from a couple of pieces, but the girlfriend took from all. The author might feel that she didn't communicate her needs properly. However, he ordered the pizza before confirming if she wanted any, which might have been a mistake. Also, when he asked why she wasn't eating, he didn't check in more clearly. The girlfriend might not have realized that taking from all pieces would be an issue. \n\nBut then, the author's reaction was calling her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. Maybe he overreacted? On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't clarify her request and went through all the effort of removing toppings from every piece without discussing it. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't ask if she wanted to order her own pizza or if she wanted a different type. He ordered first, so maybe he should have considered her preferences. But her taking the toppings off every piece without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the argument might have been avoided if the author had been more communicative. \n\nIn the end, both parties might have contributed to the situation. The author's anger might be justified because he paid for the pizza he wanted, and her actions affected that. But his reaction was harsh. Alternatively, the girlfriend should have communicated better. \n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A, then yes, he is. If B, then no. Considering the situation, the author could have handled it better. He ordered first without ensuring her preferences, and his reaction was harsh. However, the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A because he started the fight and reacted angrily. Or B because he had a valid point. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is A because his communication was lacking, leading to the misunderstanding, and he escalated it with harsh words. Alternatively, B because the girlfriend's actions were wrong. Hmm. Need to decide.\n"
