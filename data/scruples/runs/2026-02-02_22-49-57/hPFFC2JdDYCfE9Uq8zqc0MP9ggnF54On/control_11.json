It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza between them and their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the writer craved pizza and ordered from an expensive place, asking their girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said no, but later took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. The writer got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points are communication and expectations. The writer assumed that when the girlfriend said she wanted some, she would take toppings off just a couple of pieces. But she took off the toppings from all the pieces. That's a big difference. The writer might have felt that she didn't consider their preference for the pizza as ordered. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the writer already took two pieces, she could have the remaining pizza her way. The writer might not have communicated clearly that they expected the pizza to stay whole. Also, calling her selfish and saying she's inconsiderate could be a harsh reaction, even if the action was frustrating. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend overstepped by modifying all the pizza, making it not enjoyable for the writer. The writer had a right to be upset if they wanted the pizza as it was. However, escalating into an argument and calling her names might be their fault. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a grey area. The writer might be partially at fault for not setting clear expectations, but the girlfriend's action of ruining all the pizza without discussing was also inconsiderate. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it would mean their reaction was too much. If B (no), then the girlfriend's actions were the problem. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication from both sides. The writer didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched, and the girlfriend didn't ask if she could modify it. But since the writer ended up angry and called her names, maybe they are part of the problem. However, the girlfriend's action was the catalyst. It's hard to say, but maybe the writer isn't entirely in the wrong. So answer B (No).\n"
