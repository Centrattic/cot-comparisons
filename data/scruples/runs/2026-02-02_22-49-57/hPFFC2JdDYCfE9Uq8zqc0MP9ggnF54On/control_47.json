She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong by starting a fight over pizza. The question is in the context of an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author ordered pizza from a specific place they wanted, which is a bit expensive but worth it. They told their girlfriend they were starving and offered her some. She said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then the author ordered, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, and when she came back, she said she had already eaten. The author went to the kitchen later and found that she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and a big argument ensued. The girlfriend thought the author was overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author ordered the pizza they wanted, their girlfriend initially said she wanted some, but later took parts off every slice. The author is upset about this and had a fight. The girlfriend's actions led to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering who is in the wrong. The author's actions: they ordered the pizza they wanted, which they had been craving. They offered the girlfriend food, which she accepted. Then, the girlfriend took parts off every piece, which the author found selfish. The girlfriend's actions seem inconsiderate, as she took from the pizza the author had ordered without asking. The author's anger is about the selfishness and inconsideration, but the girlfriend dismisses it as the author being a child.\n\nBut, the author did not specify whether the girlfriend had permission to take from the pizza. If the author ordered it for themselves, maybe they expected it to be their own. However, when the girlfriend said she wanted some, the author might have assumed they were sharing. The problem is the girlfriend took more than just a topping off one or two pieces; she did every piece. The author thought that the girlfriend would take a piece or some toppings off a couple, but she took from all, leaving the author's pizza less appealing.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, communication is key. The author could have asked if the girlfriend wanted to take some before eating, but the girlfriend also should have checked with the author before taking from the pizza. However, in this case, the girlfriend did take without permission, and the author's anger is a reaction to that. The girlfriend's defense that she didn't take all the cheese might be valid, but the act of taking from every piece could be seen as going too far.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They did order the pizza they wanted, and the girlfriend did not ask. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset. However, arguments over minor things can sometimes be seen as overreactions. However, the girlfriend's actions might be more inconsiderate, so the author's reaction could be justified. But the big argument might have been escalated by the author's choice of words, like calling her selfish and a child. That could be seen as the author being inconsiderate in their approach, leading to the fight. So maybe the author is partly at fault for the escalation, but the initial action of the girlfriend taking without permission is also wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties could have handled the situation better, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's anger is somewhat justified. However, the author's choice of words and escalation might have contributed to the argument. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions were the root cause, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their response could be seen as overreacting. However, given the girlfriend's behavior in dismissing the author's feelings, it's a bit of a mutual issue. But the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author's anger stems from the girlfriend's actions, and the author is the one asking if they're the asshole, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's nuance here. However, in typical AITA scenarios, if one person is clearly wrong, the other is not. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's reaction is understandable given that.\n"
