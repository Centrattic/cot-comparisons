It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The guy ordered pizza because he was starving, asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but would have some of his pizza. Then when he got the pizza, he took two slices. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings and cheese off all the pieces. The guy got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is more expensive. He ordered it intending to share, maybe expecting her to take some slices or at least part of a slice. Instead, she took toppings off every piece, leaving them inedible for him. He felt that was inconsiderate because he had already eaten two slices, and she had made the rest less enjoyable for him. \n\nBut then again, maybe he overreacted. The girlfriend might have thought she was being helpful by not eating whole pieces but just taking some toppings. However, removing all toppings and cheese from every piece seems excessive. If she wanted to have some, maybe taking a slice or half a slice would have been better. But she took from all the pieces, which would make the remaining pizza less good for him. \n\nThe guy's anger might be justified because he paid for the pizza and was using it for himself, but he also invited her to have some. Her action of taking toppings off all pieces might have been a form of passive-aggressive behavior or just misunderstanding. The argument then escalated, and she accused him of acting like a child. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza intending to share, and she did say she wanted some. By taking all the toppings, she made the remaining pizza less enjoyable. His anger at that might be reasonable, but arguing and bringing up other issues might have made the situation worse. However, the initial action of her taking all the toppings could be seen as selfish. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the guy should have considered that she might not like the pizza and not have expected her to eat it. But he asked if she wanted something, so he probably expected her to take some. If she took all the toppings, maybe she didn't communicate that properly. \n\nSo the main issue is whether the guy's anger was justified. Since she altered the pizza in a way that made it less good for him after he had his share, maybe the guy isn't in the wrong. The problem is both sides have some responsibility. The girlfriend might have been inconsiderate, and the guy might have overreacted. But the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that he ordered the pizza, intended to share, and found her actions inconsiderate, the answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong. However, depending on perspective, maybe A (Yes) if his reaction was too harsh. But the key is that she took all the toppings, which is a significant action that could be seen as selfish. So the author's anger might be justified, making him not in the wrong. So answer B."
