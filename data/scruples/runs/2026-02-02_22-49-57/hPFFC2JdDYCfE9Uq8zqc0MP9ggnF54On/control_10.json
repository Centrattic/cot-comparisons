She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces, which made the guy angry.\n\nFirst, the guy ordered the pizza because he wanted it from a specific place. He offered her a piece, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. Then he took two pieces, left them, and when he went back, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got mad, called her selfish, she thought he was overreacting.\n\nHmm. So, from the guy's perspective, he paid for the pizza, expecting to eat the pizza as it was. When she took toppings off all of them, he felt it was inconsiderate. But she thought she was just having a bit of the toppings, not taking everything. She might not have realized the impact of her actions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he didn't consider that she might prefer the toppings off. Did he specify how she should eat it? Probably not. She might have just wanted the toppings and thought it was okay to remove them. But removing from every piece seems excessive. However, he did take two pieces for himself first. Maybe she thought the rest was fair game.\n\nBut the main issue is communication. He was upset because she altered the pizza he paid for. But he could have communicated his preferences earlier. She might not have known he wanted the pizza as-is. The argument could have been avoided if he mentioned how he wanted the pizza prepared when ordering. \n\nHowever, the act of modifying the pizza she was eating, especially after he had already taken pieces, might be seen as selfish. But she thought she was just having the toppings. The problem is mutual misunderstanding. He might be overreacting by calling her selfish without discussing it first. \n\nBut considering the cost and the effort he took to get this specific pizza, maybe his reaction is understandable. However, yelling and escalating into an argument is not the right approach. The key point is whether his anger was justified. The girl didn't take all the pizza, just parts. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings calmly instead of getting angry. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't like the way she handled the pizza, he should have talked it out without accusations. She might not have realized the significance of the pizza to him. But taking toppings off every piece does seem inconsiderate, as it affects the rest of the pizza he wanted to eat. \n\nSo, the guy's anger is justified to some extent, but his reaction might be inconsiderate. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, but maybe not malicious. The problem is both sides not communicating their needs. The guy is in the wrong for overreacting and not discussing his preferences beforehand. The answer might be A or B depending on perspective. \n\nBut according to the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author called the girlfriend selfish and started an argument. If the girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza, just parts, maybe he's overreacting. However, if she took from all pieces, that's a bigger issue. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because the girlfriend did something inconsiderate. But maybe the author is in the wrong for the way he reacted. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the key is that the girl didn't take the entire pizza, just parts, so the author's reaction was disproportionate. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for overreacting. Wait, but the girl took from all pieces. Removing toppings from every piece is worse. The author's reaction is justified. Maybe answer B, not in the wrong. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the girl's actions affected the rest of the pizza. On the other, the author could have communicated his expectations. However, the girl's action was inconsiderate, and the author's anger, while maybe harsh, is about a shared expense and preference. So, perhaps the answer is B, not in the wrong. The girl's actions were selfish, so the author is right to be upset.\n"
