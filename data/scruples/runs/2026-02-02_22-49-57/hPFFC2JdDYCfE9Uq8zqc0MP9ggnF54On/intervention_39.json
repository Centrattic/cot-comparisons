It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and their girlfriend. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. The girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything but later took toppings off all the pizza pieces, leaving the author upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no. They then ordered the pizza, ate two slices, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, and when she came back, she said she took some toppings off. The author found out that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece, which made the author angry. The girlfriend was confused and thought the author was being a child.\n\nThe author feels justified in their anger because they think the girlfriend was selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she had already given the author their pieces and that the remaining pizza was hers to do with as she wanted. The argument escalated, bringing up other issues.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main question is about the proportionality of the anger. The author ordered pizza they were craving, the girlfriend didn't mention wanting any, but later took from all slices. The author's frustration is about the girlfriend modifying the pizza they had paid for and wanted to eat. The girlfriend didn't communicate her need for some toppings, and her actions might have been inconsiderate because it affected the author's enjoyment. However, the author could have considered that maybe the girlfriend wanted some toppings and not the whole pizza, but the way they handled it led to a fight.\n\nBut maybe the author overreacted. It's just pizza, and getting angry enough to start a big argument might be disproportionate. The girlfriend was confused initially, thinking she was being reasonable. Maybe the author didn't consider that the girlfriend might have been trying to share the toppings or didn't realize the impact. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from every piece could be seen as taking more than just a little, which the author had a right to be upset about.\n\nAnother angle: the author ordered the pizza for themselves, but the girlfriend ended up altering all the pieces. Even if the author had two slices, the rest was still a shared purchase. The girlfriend's modification might have been inconsiderate, especially if the author wanted to eat the remaining pizza as it was. However, the author could have communicated their preference before ordering or clarified during the process.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend didn't ask for any modifications, so the author might have assumed the pizza would be as ordered. The girlfriend's action was unexpected, leading to frustration. But does that justify calling the girlfriend selfish and starting an argument? Maybe not. The author's reaction could have been more measured instead of immediately calling someone selfish and escalating the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece without discussing it could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have a valid point about the selfishness, but the way they expressed it led to a conflict. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger was due to the girlfriend's inconsiderate action, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the author overreacted and escalated the situation unnecessarily, then they might be partially at fault.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't clear-cut. But the key is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. The author ordered the pizza, the girlfriend didn't communicate her need, and the author reacted emotionally. The girlfriend may have overstepped, but the author's response could have been handled better. However, the initial action of not communicating by the girlfriend might be the main issue. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. But maybe the author could have handled it without the argument. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong, and considering the girlfriend's actions, the author's anger might be justified. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
