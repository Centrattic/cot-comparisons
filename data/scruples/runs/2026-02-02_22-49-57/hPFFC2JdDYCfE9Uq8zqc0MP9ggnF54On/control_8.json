It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering expensive pizza, sharing it with their girlfriend, and then finding out she took toppings off all the slices, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author ordered the pizza, expecting to share it. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever pizza they got. But when the pizza arrived, the girlfriend took toppings off every piece. The author felt this was selfish and inconsiderate, while the girlfriend thought it was fine.\n\nFrom the author's side, they might feel that sharing a meal is a mutual agreement. If someone orders a specific type of food, especially if it's expensive, they might expect that their partner would respect that choice. The girlfriend took chunks of cheese and toppings off all the pieces, which could be seen as altering the meal the author specifically wanted. That could lead to frustration, especially if the author was looking forward to eating it as is.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was saving money by not ordering her own pizza. She might have considered that taking some toppings off would allow her to eat the pizza without having to order something separate. However, the method she used\u2014removing toppings from all pieces\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate because it affected the author's portions. She might not have realized that this action would be so upsetting.\n\nThe argument escalated when the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, and she responded by saying they were acting like a child. This back-and-forth suggests that communication was poor. The author might have overreacted by calling their partner names, which could have made the situation worse. However, the initial action of the girlfriend removing toppings from all the pizza pieces without discussing it could have been the root of the problem.\n\nIt's important to consider cultural norms around sharing food. In some contexts, sharing a meal is about mutual respect, and altering someone else's food without consent might be frowned upon. The fact that the author was specific about ordering from a particular place adds weight to the expectation that the pizza would be enjoyed as ordered.\n\nBut the girlfriend did mention she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author assumed she took toppings from one or two pieces, but the reality was worse. The girlfriend's action of removing toppings from every piece shows a lack of consideration for the author's preference. However, the author's response was to call her names and escalate the argument, which might have been unnecessary.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did express frustration, which is understandable, but their reaction might have been disproportionate. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response of yelling and using harsh language could also be seen as their fault. However, the initial problem was the girlfriend's inconsiderate act. The author's anger is a reaction to that, so maybe both share some responsibility. But the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's action was the trigger, perhaps the author isn't entirely wrong for being upset. However, their response might have been too harsh. But given the context, maybe the girlfriend is more at fault for taking the toppings off without consent. I need to decide if the author's reaction was justified or if they overstepped. If the answer is A (author is in the wrong), that would mean their anger was unwarranted. If B, then the girlfriend's action was more to blame. Given that the girlfriend altered the author's food, the author's frustration is valid, but their response might have been too harsh. However, in terms of who is more at fault, the girlfriend's actions were the main issue. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but with the caveat that both could have communicated better. But according to the question's instructions, it's a binary choice. Given that the girlfriend took the toppings off, the author's anger is somewhat justified, so the answer would be B.\n"
