It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said she'd just have some of what he gets. He orders, eats two slices, and when he goes to the kitchen, he finds that she's taken toppings and cheese off every single piece, leaving the pizza inedible for him. They argue, and the author feels she was selfish, while she says he's overreacting.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's start with the facts. The girlfriend said she would have some of the pizza he ordered. But when she took toppings off all the pieces, she made the pizza he wanted to eat tasteless, essentially ruining it for him. The author was angry because his specific pizza choice was altered in a way that made it unenjoyable. She, on the other hand, thought it was okay to take what she wanted without considering his preferences. \n\nThe author's reasoning for being angry is that she was inconsiderate and selfish. He ordered a specific pizza he was craving, and by removing the toppings, she deprived him of the meal he wanted. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, suggesting he was overreacting. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong: Did he have a right to be upset? Well, he ordered the pizza with the assumption that his girlfriend would eat it as is if she chose to partake. Her altering the pizza so completely that it's unrecognizable from what he ordered seems inconsiderate. However, maybe the author could have communicated his preferences more clearly. For example, he could have specified that he wanted the pizza to stay intact, or maybe he didn't consider that she might take so much. But in this scenario, he didn't, and she did. \n\nThe key here is mutual consideration. The author ordered the pizza with the intent to eat it as is. The girlfriend's action of removing toppings from every piece goes beyond just taking a slice or two; she made the entire pizza unsuitable for the author's taste. The author's reaction is about the fact that his meal was ruined, which could be a valid point. However, maybe he could have handled it differently. For example, rather than calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion, he could have calmly expressed that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was ordered. \n\nBut given the situation, the girlfriend's action was the immediate cause of the conflict. The author was within his right to be upset because his meal choice was altered without his consent, which is a reasonable reaction. The girlfriend's behavior was the problem here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry over this. The answer is B (No).\n"
