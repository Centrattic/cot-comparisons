It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The user ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would have some of whatever he got. Then when the pizza arrived, he took two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, he noticed she wasn't eating. She said she took toppings and cheese off all the pieces, not just one or two. He got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user thought he was sharing the pizza since he asked if she wanted any. She said yes but didn't take a whole piece, just some toppings. He assumed she took one or two pieces' toppings, but she took from all. He felt she was being selfish by reducing the amount he could eat. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought since he already had his two pieces, it's fine she took from the rest. She didn't take all the cheese, so she considered it still edible for him. She got annoyed when he called her selfish, thinking he was overreacting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the user) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did he overreact? The pizza was expensive and he was craving it, so he might feel it's a big deal. But maybe he didn't communicate clearly. He ordered the pizza expecting to share, but maybe didn't specify that he wanted to eat it himself. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have assumed since he had his pieces, the rest was fair game. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. The user was angry because she took from all the pieces, making the remaining pizza less for him. But the girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza, just toppings. However, the user might value the pizza more, so the act of taking toppings from all pieces felt like a big deal. \n\nIs the user wrong? If they had discussed beforehand how they wanted to split the pizza, maybe there wouldn't be an issue. But the user didn't specify. The girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole piece. But the way she took from all pieces could be inconsiderate. The user's reaction was anger and calling her selfish. Maybe the argument escalated because of that. So, is the user at fault? If he didn't set clear expectations, perhaps he's partly to blame. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user might have assumed she would take one or two pieces, but she took from all. The user's anger is about the scarcity of the pizza and his craving. The girlfriend's action was selfish in that she took more than he expected. However, the user's response was harsh. So maybe both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is the one who started the fight by reacting angrily. If he overreacted, then he's in the wrong. But if his reaction was justified given the situation, then he's not. \n\nConsidering the girlfriend's perspective, she thought she was being helpful by taking only some toppings. The user's frustration comes from not getting what he expected. It's possible that the user's reaction was disproportionate, making him at fault. On the other hand, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the user isn't entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the user's anger was justified. Since the pizza was from a specific, expensive place he was craving, and the girlfriend took from all pieces, maybe his reaction isn't entirely out of proportion. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish, leading to a big argument) might be inconsiderate. The key point is whether the action (taking toppings) was selfish. If the user had his two pieces, maybe the rest is shared, but taking all toppings makes it less for him. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B (No).\n"
