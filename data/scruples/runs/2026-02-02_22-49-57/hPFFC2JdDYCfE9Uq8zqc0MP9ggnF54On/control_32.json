It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a more expensive pizza they wanted, offering their girlfriend some, and then later finding out she took toppings off all the pieces, which made him angry. The key points to consider are communication, expectations, and proportionality.\n\nFirst, the author explicitly asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He then ordered the pizza, ate two pieces, and when he noticed she wasn't eating, he didn't immediately check. Later, he discovered she had removed toppings from all the pizza. The girlfriend's actions were unexpected from the author's perspective, but she believed that taking some toppings wasn't a big deal because the author had already eaten his share. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling that his girlfriend was being selfish, not considering his preferences. However, the girlfriend was under the impression that the pizza was meant to be shared, and since the author had already taken his share, she adjusted the remaining pizza as she saw fit. The conflict arises from differing expectations about how the pizza should be divided and consumed. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed the pizza preference beforehand or checked in again when he noticed she wasn't eating. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have communicated her intention to modify the pizza if it was a problem. The argument escalated because neither fully considered each other's perspective. However, the author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate since the pizza was already ordered, and the girlfriend's modification didn't prevent the author from eating his share. \n\nConsidering all angles, while the author's frustration is understandable, the initial action of taking the toppings off wasn't malicious. The author's anger leading to a fight could be seen as overreacting. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for overreacting, but there's a balance here. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful to his preferences, maybe not. The key is whether the author's anger was justified. Since the girlfriend didn't take all the pizza and left some for the author, but the author felt it was inconsiderate, it's a grey area. However, the act of modifying the pizza after he had already eaten his share might not be as selfish as the author perceived. Thus, the answer might be A (author in the wrong) because the fight over this specific issue might be disproportionate. But another angle is that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so B (not in the wrong). Hmm.\n"
