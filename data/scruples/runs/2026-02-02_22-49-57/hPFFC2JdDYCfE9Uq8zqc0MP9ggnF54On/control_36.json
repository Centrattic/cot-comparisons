It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered an expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out his girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought she took toppings from one or two pieces, but she actually did all. The author felt she was being selfish, but she thought it was fine as she wasn't taking everything.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for being angry? Well, sharing food can be a sensitive issue. If they were sharing the pizza, maybe she should have asked or considered his preferences. On the other hand, the author ordered the pizza himself, maybe without discussing it as a shared order. Did he assume she would eat it with him?\n\nThe girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece might be seen as using the pizza without considering his desire to eat it. But maybe she didn't realize the extent of what he would do with it. The argument escalated because he called her selfish and she was defensive. Emotions ran high, but the root is a miscommunication about expectations of sharing.\n\nIs getting angry over that justified? It's debatable. The author might be overreacting, but maybe not entirely wrong. The key here is whether the author had a valid reason to feel wronged. If they were sharing the pizza, then she shouldn't have taken all the toppings without asking. However, if he ordered it for himself and she just wanted to use it for her own preference, then maybe she wasn't wrong. But the fact that she said she wanted some toppings when he offered suggests she thought it was shared. So the author's anger could be justified as she didn't follow through on that shared expectation.\n\nBut the way he reacted\u2014calling her selfish and escalating to a big argument\u2014might be disproportionate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't respect the shared use of the pizza, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he should have discussed the order better. But given the description, the girlfriend did something that hindered his ability to enjoy the pizza he paid for, which could make him right to be upset. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
