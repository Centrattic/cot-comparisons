It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry about their girlfriend taking toppings off every pizza slice.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a specific expensive pizza they were craving. The girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything but then took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt this was selfish and started an argument. The girlfriend thought it wasn't a big deal.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might feel their order was personal and the modification was disrespectful. The girlfriend might have thought she was saving money by reusing toppings or didn't want to eat the whole thing. But taking toppings off all the pieces seems excessive and inconsiderate, especially since the author was the one who ordered it and paid for it. The girlfriend's actions didn't consider the author's preferences or the cost. The argument escalated because of this misunderstanding. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to their order and the girlfriend's lack of consideration. The author's reaction might be proportionate because it's their purchase, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions. However, some might argue that sharing food is normal and the author overreacted. But given the context of the girlfriend taking all the toppings without asking, it's a breach of personal space and respect. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
