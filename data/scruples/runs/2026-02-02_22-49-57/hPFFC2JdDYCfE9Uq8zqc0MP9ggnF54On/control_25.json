It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ordered pizza from a specific place because he was craving it. His girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he ordered. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back. He asked why she wasn't eating, and she said she took toppings off. He found out she took toppings and cheese from every piece, thinking she just took some from a couple. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is about expectations and communication. The guy expected her to either take a slice or not mess with the pizza, but she took toppings off all pieces, which he found inconsiderate. She thought it was okay because she didn't take all the cheese and he had his pieces. \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The guy's point: he paid for an expensive pizza he was really craving. He ordered it for both of them, expected her to take a slice or at least not ruin the rest. Her actions prevented him from enjoying his meal as intended, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend said she didn't take all the cheese, and the pizza is still edible. She might have felt she was sharing or saving money by not buying her own. Maybe she didn't realize how much he wanted that specific pizza. \n\nBut the problem is that he explicitly asked if she wanted anything, and she said yes, she'd have some of his. So he ordered, thinking she'd take a slice. Instead, she took toppings off all pieces, making it less enjoyable for him. That's a breach of his expectation. She didn't communicate her actions, and her behavior was inconsiderate of his needs. \n\nHe called her selfish, which might be harsh, but his anger is about her messing with the pizza he paid for and that he really wanted. The argument escalated because she didn't see the problem, but her actions were indeed selfish. \n\nSo the question is, was he wrong to get angry? Probably not. He had a legitimate grievance. She didn't respect his wishes by altering the pizza in a way that frustrated his craving. However, his response (calling her selfish and a child) might have been excessive, but the initial anger isn't unwarranted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have communicated better. If he had his two slices and she took toppings from others, maybe he could have discussed it calmly instead of getting angry. But the key is that her actions were inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his anger stems from her inconsiderate action towards his specific desires. She didn't respect his request by altering the pizza in a way that prevented him from enjoying it as he wanted. The problem is her actions, not his reaction.\n"
