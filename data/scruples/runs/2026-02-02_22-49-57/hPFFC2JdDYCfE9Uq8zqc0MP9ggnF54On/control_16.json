It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering pizza, eating two pieces, and then finding out their girlfriend took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. The girlfriend claims she didn't take all the cheese and that the author had already eaten their share. The author feels the girlfriend was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author ordered pizza, which is a shared expense, and expected their girlfriend to have some consideration for the food they wanted. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was being reasonable by taking some toppings if she didn't want a whole piece. However, taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as altering the food the author wanted to eat, which might be a bigger issue than the author expected.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza prepared in a certain way, nor did they mention that the girlfriend shouldn't take toppings off. The girlfriend might not have realized that the author would mind her actions. However, the act of modifying the food someone else ordered, especially when it's a specific craving, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the author's reaction is also a factor. Getting angry and calling the girlfriend selfish might be an overreaction, especially if the girlfriend didn't anticipate that the author would be upset. The argument escalated because neither party communicated their expectations clearly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong since their feelings about their pizza being altered are valid. However, they could have handled the situation better by discussing their preferences upfront. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but she might not have intended to be selfish. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. The main issue is the lack of communication rather than inherent selfishness. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate, but given the context of a personal craving, their frustration is understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
