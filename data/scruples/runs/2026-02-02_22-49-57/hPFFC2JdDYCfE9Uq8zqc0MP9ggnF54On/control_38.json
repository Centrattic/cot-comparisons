It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a fight over pizza is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author ordering an expensive pizza, sharing it with their girlfriend, and then finding out she took toppings off every piece.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author ordered a specific pizza they were craving, which was expensive. The girlfriend initially said she would have some of what he gets. He ordered it and ate his share. When he went to get more, he found that she had taken toppings off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the girlfriend's actions seem inconsiderate because she altered the pizza they both were supposed to share. The author might feel that by taking toppings off all pieces, she made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him, especially since he had already eaten his part and was left with modified leftovers. The fact that the pizza was expensive might add to the frustration, as it's a shared expense.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend claims she didn't take all the cheese and thought it was fine. She also mentioned she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. She might have thought taking toppings off a few pieces was acceptable, but she ended up doing it to every piece. Her confusion and defense of her actions could indicate that she didn't realize the impact of her actions on the author. However, the argument escalated when the author called her selfish and acted childishly.\n\nNow, considering both sides, the key points are: the girlfriend altered the shared food without considering the author's preferences, and the author's reaction might be seen as overreacting. However, the girlfriend's action could be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether the author's anger was justified.\n\nBut the author did order the pizza with the understanding that the girlfriend would have some. By modifying the leftovers so that they were no longer the same pizza, the girlfriend might have acted selfishly. The author's reaction is about the shared resource being altered without communication. However, the argument is about the method of reaction. The author called the girlfriend names and acted like a child, which could be seen as the wrong approach, even if the initial frustration was valid.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's anger is justified. If the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, then the author's reaction isn't entirely wrong. But if the author's response was overly harsh and confrontational, that could make them at fault. The line between being upset about the action versus the manner of the response is important here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset about the situation, but the way they reacted (calling their partner names, escalating the argument) could be problematic. However, the initial conflict stems from the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if the author's response was harsh. However, there's a nuance here. The core issue is the inconsiderate act, so the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. But the way they handled it might be part of the problem. However, given the options, the primary responsibility might lie with the girlfriend, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
