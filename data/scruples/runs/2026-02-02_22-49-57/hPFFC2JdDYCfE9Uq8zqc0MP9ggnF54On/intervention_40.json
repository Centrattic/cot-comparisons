It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is a bit pricier but worth it. They ordered it and asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever they got. Then the author took two pieces, went to watch TV, and while they were gone, the girlfriend was in the kitchen. When she came back, the author noticed she wasn't eating. She explained that she took toppings and cheese off every piece, not just one or two. The author got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The first thing I need to consider is the context. The pizza was ordered because the author was really hungry and wanted to share. The girlfriend agreed to have some of the same pizza. The author's assumption was that she might take toppings off one or two pieces, but she did it to all. That's a problem because the author wanted to eat the pizza as it was, maybe with the toppings on. Removing the toppings from all pieces makes the pizza less enjoyable for the author, especially if they were craving it. But was the author's reaction justified?\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend did say she would have some of the same pizza, but maybe she didn't specify that she wanted it without toppings. The author might not have known she prefers plain cheese pizza, so the assumption here is that she was okay with the toppings. When she took them off, it could be seen as not respecting the author's choice, especially if the author paid for the specific pizza they wanted. The girlfriend might have thought she could do that, but did she communicate her preference beforehand?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was too quick to assume the worst. If the girlfriend had said she wanted the pizza without toppings, the author could have ordered two different types (if available) or at least discussed it. The fact that the author didn't consider that she might want a different configuration and got angry over it might make them at fault. But the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces seems pretty selfish, especially if the author had already taken two and she decided to take from the rest. If the pizza was expensive and the author wanted to eat it as is, that's a valid point.\n\nWait, the author ordered the pizza for themselves and offered it to her. She agreed to have some, but then modified all the pieces. If the author didn't expect her to do that, and she did, then the anger is understandable. However, the author could have checked if she wanted a different type of pizza. But maybe that's not the point. The main issue is that she took off the toppings from every piece, which the author might have wanted to eat. Was the author wrong to get upset about that? The girlfriend said she didn't take all the cheese, so maybe the pieces were still okay, but the act of taking from all of them shows a lack of consideration. The author might have felt their meal was being compromised for no reason.\n\nBut is it the author's fault for not realizing she might want a different style? Maybe there's a communication gap. The author thought she would take a few pieces as is or with minimal changes, but she made a big change. The argument escalated because of unspoken expectations. So, who is in the wrong? The author perhaps overreacted, but the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. However, if the author had ordered it with the understanding that she might want to eat as they did, then the girlfriend not respecting that makes her at fault. The key here is both parties not clearly communicating their preferences. The author might not be wrong for feeling upset, but their reaction could be seen as excessive. The girlfriend's action was definitely inconsiderate, but was the author wrong in getting angry? Maybe not, but the argument might have been avoidable with better communication. So, the answer could be B, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is a bit of a shared misunderstanding.\n"
