It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry over their girlfriend taking toppings off every piece of pizza after he ordered it. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author ordered expensive pizza, asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said she'd have some of what he gets. He orders, eats two pieces, and then later finds out she took toppings off all the pieces. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the expectations and communication. When he asked if she wanted anything, she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. That implies she expected to share the pizza. He ordered it with the understanding that they would both eat it. Then, when she took toppings off all the pieces, he felt she was being selfish because now he can't eat them as ordered.\n\nBut wait, maybe there was a misunderstanding. She might have thought that since he had already taken two pieces, she could modify the rest. But he expected her to take maybe a few pieces, not alter all of them. The issue here is that she didn't communicate her intentions. He ordered the pizza for both of them, and she ended up making it less enjoyable for him without discussing it. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have felt that since he had his share, it was okay for her to adjust the remaining pizza to her taste. But by taking toppings off every piece, she left him with less desirable leftovers. That's where the conflict arises. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza and eat his two pieces first. He might have expected that the remaining pizza would be left intact for him to eat later. His reaction was anger, which is a strong emotion, but given the context, maybe justified. The girlfriend didn't ask or communicate her actions, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the argument escalated into name-calling, which isn't helpful. \n\nBut the core issue is whether his anger was disproportionate. The author feels that the act of taking toppings off all the pizza was selfish. The girlfriend felt it was fine because he already had his pieces. So it's a matter of differing expectations. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had specified that he wanted the pizza as ordered, maybe the situation could have been avoided. However, since the girlfriend didn't communicate her actions and modified the shared food without discussing it, that's a point against her. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which might have been harsh, but the act itself was inconsiderate. The girlfriend being defensive and dismissing his feelings by calling him a child probably made things worse. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's anger is understandable given the shared context. The main fault might lie with the girlfriend for not discussing her actions. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
