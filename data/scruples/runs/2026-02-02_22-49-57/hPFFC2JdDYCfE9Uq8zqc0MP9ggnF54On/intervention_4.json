It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and when checking the kitchen, found that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author had been craving pizza all day, ordered it, and expected it to be there for both of them. His girlfriend said she wanted some but didn't specify, then later took toppings off all slices. The key points here are communication, expectations, and perceived selfishness.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might have expected the pizza to be shared. He ordered it and maybe assumed they would both eat the same type. When he found out she altered the pizza without discussing, he felt disrespected. His reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which escalated the argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he had already taken his slices, she was just taking what was left. She didn't take entire slices, just some toppings and cheese. She might have felt that the author was overreacting, especially if she took a small amount from each piece. Her confusion and the argument that followed could indicate she didn't see the issue.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main factors are: Did he have a right to be upset? Maybe he should have considered that she might prefer a different type of pizza but didn't want to order her own. However, he didn't check if she wanted a different kind before ordering. Also, when she didn't take the pizza initially, maybe he should have asked if she wanted her own. By not addressing that, he might have created an expectation that she would eat the same pizza as him.\n\nBut then, when she modified the pizza without talking to him, that could be seen as disrespectful. The author's anger might be justified if he felt his order was being altered without consent. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument, could have been disproportionate. It's possible he overreacted, especially if the amount she took was minimal and didn't render the pizza inedible.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend might have felt that since he had already eaten, she had the right to use the remaining pizza as she wished. If she had asked first, there wouldn't have been an issue. But she didn't, which led to the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some fault. The author didn't clarify if she wanted her own pizza or preferred a different type, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her intentions before altering the food. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His anger over someone modifying the food he paid for without discussing could be justified, but the way he handled it (calling her selfish, escalating to a big argument) might have been excessive.\n\nSo, if the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), it's because he was justified in feeling disrespected. But if the answer is A (he is in the wrong), it's because his reaction was over the top. The key here is the degree of the response versus the actual action. Taking toppings off might not be a huge deal, but for the author, it was a big deal because he valued the pizza highly. The author's perspective is that her action was selfish, but she didn't take all the food. It's a subjective judgment. I think since both have some fault, but the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing, leaning towards B because his anger wasn't entirely unfounded, even if his reaction was harsh. So the answer would be B.\n"
