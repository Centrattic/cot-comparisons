It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry over a pizza situation. So, the setup is that the author ordered pizza they were really craving, told their girlfriend they'd get it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but then took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author did order the pizza they wanted, and the girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything. She might have thought she was being polite or not imposing, but then she ended up eating the pizza by taking toppings. The author probably felt that since he paid for it and was looking forward to it, her actions were inconsiderate. But then again, maybe the girlfriend didn't realize she was being selfish. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he was buying the pizza for himself exclusively, so maybe the girlfriend assumed it was a shared meal. When she said she'd have some of whatever he got, maybe she expected to share. But when she took toppings off all the pieces, it ruined his experience. However, she might have thought she was just having a little bit without making a whole slice. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because he paid for the pizza he wanted, and her actions affected his enjoyment. But maybe he could have communicated better beforehand. Like, if he had said it's his favorite pizza and he really wants to eat it as is, she might have respected that. Alternatively, she should have asked instead of taking toppings without discussion. \n\nThe argument escalated because of the lack of clear communication. The author called her selfish, which she took as childish. Maybe both sides have some responsibility here. The author could have been more understanding, but the girlfriend did alter the pizza without considering his preferences. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about mutual respect and consideration. If she knew how much he wanted that specific pizza, she should have been more considerate. On the flip side, he could have checked if she wanted to order her own or if she was okay with the arrangement before getting it. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his request for the pizza was clear and he had a right to be upset when it was modified without his consent. However, his reaction might have been a bit over the top, but given the setup, it's understandable. The girlfriend also had some fault in not respecting his choice. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
