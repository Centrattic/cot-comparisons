It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. So, first, let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author ordered expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then the author ordered it, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When she came back, she wasn't eating. The author asked, and she said she took toppings off and chunks of cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The author feels justified because they think she was being selfish, while the girlfriend thought the author was overreacting.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They ordered pizza expecting to share, especially since the girlfriend said she would have some. When they find out she modified all the pieces, removing toppings and cheese, they feel their meal was ruined. The author might see this as selfish because they wanted the pizza as it was, and the girlfriend didn't consider their feelings. The author's anger is about the selfish act of altering the pizza without consent, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She might have thought that since the author had already taken their pieces, it was okay to modify the remaining pizza. She didn't take all the cheese, just some, and she didn't see the big deal. She might feel the author is overreacting because it's just pizza and she didn't intend to cause a problem. She could perceive the author's reaction as childish, especially since the pizza is still edible.\n\nNow, considering communication issues. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched. The girlfriend might not have realized the importance of the pizza to the author, given that it was a craving and expensive. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't ask for permission before altering the pizza, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the act of modifying the pizza might not be inherently selfish but a lack of communication.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they didn't communicate their preference for not having the pizza altered, maybe they share some responsibility. But the girlfriend also didn't consider that the author might not want their pizza changed. The argument escalated because both might have valid points but failed to understand each other's perspective. The author's anger might be disproportionate because it's just pizza, but the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. However, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating to a big argument might be excessive. The key here is whether the author's anger is justified. Since the girlfriend altered the pizza without asking, it's a breach of trust or consideration, but the author's response of calling her selfish and bringing up past arguments might be the real issue. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, then the author's anger is justified. But if the author overreacted, then A (in the wrong). It's a bit of a grey area. Given the context, the author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might be the problem. However, the initial act of the girlfriend was inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
