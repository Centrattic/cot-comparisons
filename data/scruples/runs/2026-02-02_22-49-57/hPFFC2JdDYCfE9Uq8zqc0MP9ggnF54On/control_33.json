It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two slices, and went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, he noticed she hadn't eaten. He asked why, and she said she took toppings off. When he checked the kitchen, he found all the pieces had toppings and cheese removed. He got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument where she accused him of overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author ordered a specific pizza he was craving, which was expensive. He offered the girlfriend some, and she initially said she'd have some. He ate his slices, and she ended up taking toppings off all the remaining pieces. The author felt this was selfish, while she felt he was overreacting.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is important. The author didn't clarify if she wanted the toppings off when she said she'd take some toppings. He assumed she meant a few pieces, but she took from all. However, the girlfriend didn't specify her preferences beforehand and modified the pizza after he had already eaten his portion. The author's frustration might stem from the fact that the pizza was a personal choice for him, and she altered the remaining slices in a way he found unacceptable. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza for himself, but he did offer her some. He might not have considered that she wanted it without certain toppings, but she could have mentioned it before he started eating. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her selfish and escalating into a fight\u2014might be disproportionate, especially since pizza is not a major issue. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response could be seen as overreacting. However, the girlfriend didn't communicate her preferences and modified the food without discussing it, which is also inconsiderate. The blame isn't entirely on one side. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend did take from all the slices, but the author didn't clarify her preference, maybe both have some responsibility. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be a bit of a toss-up. If the author had clarified earlier, maybe the argument wouldn't have happened. But given that she didn't specify and then modified the food after he ate, the author's anger might be understandable. However, calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion could be the issue. So the answer depends on whose actions are more at fault. If the author didn't set boundaries or clarify, he might share some blame. But the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. Overall, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but his reaction might be excessive. So the answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
