It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nSo the situation is: the author ordered a specific, expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever they get. Then when the pizza arrives, the author takes two pieces and starts eating. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, she says she was eating but only took toppings off. The author goes to the kitchen and finds that she's removed toppings and cheese from every piece. The argument ensues, with the author feeling the girlfriend was selfish, and she says the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author felt they had a specific craving, paid extra for the pizza, and thought they were being considerate by offering the girlfriend some. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was being polite by not ordering her own pizza but taking what she wanted from the shared order. However, when she removed toppings from all pieces, that might have affected the author's enjoyment of the pizza, making it less what they wanted.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the girlfriend did say she wanted some of the pizza, and the author paid for it. If she modified the pizza significantly, that could be seen as altering something the author had paid for without consent. But maybe the author could have considered that the girlfriend wasn't interested in the same toppings and ordered something else. However, the girlfriend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might be proportionate given their specific craving. Alternatively, maybe the author should have ordered separately if they were that particular. But the girlfriend's behavior of taking toppings from every piece is inconsiderate and affects the author's meal. The argument might be about differing expectations and communication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if they felt their preferences were respected. But perhaps the author overreacted by calling the girlfriend selfish and starting a fight. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. Depending on cultural norms or personal boundaries, but the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so maybe the author isn't wrong. But maybe the author could have handled it better without a fight. Hmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's frustration is understandable. However, maybe the author should have considered ordering separate pizzas to avoid the conflict. But the girlfriend might have thought taking some toppings was okay. It's a bit ambiguous, but leaning towards B because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate.\n"
