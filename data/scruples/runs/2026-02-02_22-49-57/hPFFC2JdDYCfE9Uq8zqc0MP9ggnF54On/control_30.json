It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered expensive pizza because that's what they craved. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then the author ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and when they went to the kitchen, found that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. Now, the author is asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's point of view is that they ordered the pizza they wanted, expecting to share it. They might feel that the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece was inconsiderate because they wanted to eat the pizza as it was. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author had already taken their pieces, she could modify the remaining pizza as she liked. She might not see it as selfish because she's adjusting it to her own taste without taking the whole pizza. \n\nBut wait, the author mentioned that the pizza was from a specific place they wanted, which is more expensive. Maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the significance of that choice to the author. The author could have communicated their preference more clearly, like specifying that they wanted the pizza as is, or maybe that they expected to share it. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces might be seen as altering something that the author had ordered specifically for themselves, which could be a breach of mutual consideration in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that she's entitled to eat the pizza in a way she likes, especially since it wasn't just her expense. The argument here is about shared meals and personal preferences. The author's frustration might stem from the fact that the pizza was a treat they were excited about, and the modification felt like a personal affront. \n\nI think the key here is communication. The author didn't clarify their expectations when ordering, so maybe they share some responsibility. However, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza without asking could also be seen as not considering the author's preferences. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut considering the girlfriend's response\u2014saying she just wanted some toppings, not the whole piece\u2014it's possible she didn't realize the extent of what she did. The author's anger might be a reaction to the lack of communication from both sides. The author could have said they wanted to keep the pizza as is, and the girlfriend could have asked if she could adjust it. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from every piece might have been excessive and not respectful of the original order. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each other's preferences. If the author ordered a specific pizza they were excited about, expecting to share it, then the girlfriend's modification without checking could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author also didn't set clear boundaries. It's a two-way street. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author got angry over the modification, called the girlfriend selfish, and the argument escalated. The girlfriend might have overstepped, but the author's reaction might have been too harsh given that the pizza is still edible and it's a minor issue. However, the emotional reaction is valid if the pizza was a big deal for the author. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's action could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author could have handled it differently instead of starting a fight. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because the author's reaction is proportionate to the situation if the pizza was important to them. The girlfriend's action was disrespectful without communication, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
