It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza order. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they wanted it, even though it's a bit more expensive. They told their girlfriend they were ordering and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he orders, eats two pieces, and when he goes to the kitchen, he finds that she's taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author ordered the pizza primarily for himself, but the girlfriend agreed to have some of it. The key point is whether she had the right to alter the pizza without his consent. The author might feel ownership over the pizza since he paid for it, even though he offered her a share. However, when she said she'd have some, maybe he expected her to take a piece or part of it, not modify all the pieces.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken his two pieces, she could adjust the remaining pizza to her taste. She might not have realized how important the pizza was to him, especially since it's from his favorite place. Her actions could be seen as inconsiderate because she changed the pizza he paid for, which he was looking forward to eating. But then again, maybe she didn't take all the toppings, just some, which he found unacceptable.\n\nThe author's reaction is anger and calling her selfish. Is that justified? If the pizza was a personal expense and he didn't expect her to have specific preferences, then maybe he should have clarified. However, the girlfriend didn't communicate that she wanted to modify the pizza. She just assumed she could do it after he had his share.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have an obligation to share the pizza as is? If he ordered it for himself but invited her to partake, then she might assume she can adjust it to her liking. But if the pizza was his personal choice and she altered it without asking, that's where the problem lies.\n\nThe author might be in the right if he felt his preferences were disregarded, but he could also be at fault for not considering that she might want it differently. However, the main issue is that she modified the pizza he had paid for without his consent, which could be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness might indicate she didn't realize the impact of her actions, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for being upset.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could share some blame. The author didn't specify his expectations, and the girlfriend didn't ask before altering the pizza. However, since the author paid for it and it was his specific choice, the modification without consent is more on her. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe both have some responsibility. But according to the options, it's either A or B. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the main issue is her actions, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. If the author's reaction was disproportionate, maybe A. But given the context, he was upset about his pizza being altered after paying for it. So probably B is correct.\n"
