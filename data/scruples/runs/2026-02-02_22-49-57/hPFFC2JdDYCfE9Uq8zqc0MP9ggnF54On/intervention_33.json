It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, let's break down what happened. The author ordered expensive pizza they had been craving, asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, and she said she'd have some of what they got. Then he ordered it, took two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and came back without eating. When he asked why, she said she wanted toppings, not the whole piece. He thought she took toppings off some pieces, but when he checked the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they ended up in an argument.\n\nSo the user is asking if the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to decide if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet's consider both perspectives. The author's side: They were craving pizza, ordered something specific, and expected their GF to either take a piece or say she didn't want it. When she modified all pieces, maybe he felt it was inconsiderate because he wanted the pizza as it was. Also, he might have thought that since he ordered it for her, she wouldn't alter it in a way that ruins it for him.\n\nThe GF's side: She didn't want a whole piece, just toppings. She might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted, assuming the author had his pieces. She might not see the problem since she's just taking what she wants, and the pizza wasn't ruined entirely. She might also feel the author overreacted.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, when he ordered the pizza, he asked her if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of what he got. He might have expected her to either take a piece or not take any if she didn't want the whole thing. However, she took toppings off every piece, which probably made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. But is that his right to expect? Maybe he should have considered that she might not like the pizza as much as he did, or have dietary preferences. But she didn't communicate that clearly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's anger might be over a minor thing. It's just pizza, and maybe he overreacted by calling her selfish. However, if it's expensive and he had a specific craving, maybe he felt it was more important. The key is whether her actions were inconsiderate. Taking toppings off every piece could be seen as altering the food in a way that affects the person who paid for it and was expecting to eat it as is. \n\nBut was he wrong to be upset? Well, if he had communicated his expectations better, maybe this could have been avoided. He might have assumed she would take a piece or not touch it if she didn't want it. However, she didn't clarify her preferences until after he had ordered, and then she ended up modifying the pizza in a way that wasn't clear. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both parties could have communicated better. The author might have assumed she would take a piece, and she might have assumed she could take toppings without causing an issue. But the author's reaction might have been proportionate to his feelings, even if the situation seems trivial to others. \n\nIn AITA stories, often the person is considered at fault if their reaction is unreasonable. However, in this case, the GF's action of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as selfish because she altered the food in a way that affected the author's enjoyment. The author's anger might be justified in that context. However, calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be harsh, especially if he didn't check the pizza until later. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be wrong in expecting that the GF wouldn't modify the food once it's there. Maybe he should have considered that she might not want certain toppings, but didn't communicate that earlier. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that she took toppings off all pieces, which is a significant alteration, and the author was expecting to eat the pizza as it was, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The GF's actions did affect the author's meal, and the author has a right to be upset if he feels his food was taken from him. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the author overreacted by calling her selfish and bringing up other issues. But the initial act of taking toppings off all pieces is problematic. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
