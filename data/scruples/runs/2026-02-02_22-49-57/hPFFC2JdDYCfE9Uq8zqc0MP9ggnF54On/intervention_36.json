It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever the author gets. Then the author orders, eats two pieces, and when they check the kitchen, the girlfriend has taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author gets angry, calls her selfish and inconsiderate, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was really craving this pizza, which is more expensive, so they might feel it's a special treat. They ordered it intending to share, and the girlfriend said she wanted some. The author might have expected her to take a piece or maybe some toppings from one or two pieces. But instead, she took from every piece, which left the author's remaining pizza less enjoyable. The author's anger is over the perceived selfishness and not considering their feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken their pieces, they were okay with her taking some toppings. She might not have realized how much the author valued the pizza, or that removing toppings from all pieces would ruin it for the author. She might see it as a minor issue, as she didn't take all the cheese, and the pizza is still edible.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions: they ordered the pizza for themselves but also offered to share. The girlfriend accepted but in a way the author didn't expect. The argument arises from the girlfriend's actions affecting the author's enjoyment. The author's anger is about the girlfriend's inconsideration. However, maybe the author overreacted? Is it reasonable to get angry over someone taking toppings, especially if the author had already eaten their share?\n\nBut the key point is that the girlfriend took from every piece, which might mean the author's remaining pizza was ruined. If the author was sharing, maybe they should have specified how they wanted the pizza shared. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have been entitled to take some, but taking from all pieces could be seen as excessive. The author's frustration comes from the girlfriend not respecting their preference or not understanding how much the pizza meant to them.\n\nIs the author at fault for not communicating their expectations better? Or is the girlfriend at fault for taking more than they should? It's a bit of a gray area. The author called the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which is harsh, but maybe justified if the action did ruin the pizza. The girlfriend's response was to dismiss the author's feelings, which is also problematic. \n\nIn arguments like this, communication is often key. The author might have been a bit hasty in their reaction, but the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. So, the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted, but maybe their approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish and the author's reaction was proportionate to that, then they aren't in the wrong. But if the author overreacted, then maybe they are. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset, even if the argument escalated. So the answer is B.\n"
