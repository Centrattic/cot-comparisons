It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a fight over pizza is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place because it's their craving. They told their girlfriend they were ordering and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but wanted some of what he got. He ordered, ate two slices, then went back to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen, and when he noticed she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off the pizza. Later, he found out she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The user thinks the author is not wrong but wants to know if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author ordered pizza because they were craving it, which is a personal choice. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no but wanted some of what he ordered. He ordered it, ate his two slices, then went back to the TV. The girlfriend ended up taking toppings off every piece. The author is upset about this. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that the pizza was bought for both of them to share, and she altered the food he paid for without considering his preference. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since he had already eaten his slices, she could modify the remaining pizza as she liked. She might not see it as selfish but as her right to adjust the food to her taste. \n\nNow, social norms and communication play a role here. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to stay as is, so the girlfriend might not have realized the importance of the pizza to him. However, the author could have communicated that he wanted to share the pizza as ordered. Alternatively, he might have considered ordering two different types of pizza if they have conflicting preferences. \n\nThe argument escalated because the author felt his food was being altered without his consent. But is that a valid reason for a fight? The girlfriend might argue that she was within her rights to adjust the food she was eating. However, the fact that she did this to every piece might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the author had a specific craving for the pizza as it was. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong, which makes sense because the girlfriend altered the food without considering the author's preferences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry. The author might have overreacted by calling her selfish and inconsiderate, which could have been a harsh response. However, the act of altering the pizza might have been a breach of unspoken expectations of sharing food. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his preference before ordering, or the girlfriend could have asked if she wanted to modify the pizza. But given the situation, the author's anger might be justified if he felt his request was ignored. However, the argument over pizza seems disproportionate. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been too strong. However, considering the context, the answer might still be B.\n"
