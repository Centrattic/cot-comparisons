She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So, first, I need to understand the situation as presented.\n\nThe author ordered a pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. They mentioned it's more expensive but worth it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her some. She said she'd just take some of whatever he got. Then he ate two slices, went to watch TV, and when he checked, she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When the author ordered the pizza, he asked if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of what he got. However, he didn't clarify whether she wanted a whole slice or just some toppings. She interpreted it as getting toppings off the existing pizza, while he expected her to take an entire slice if she wanted some. Then, when she did take toppings off all the pieces, he was upset because he thought she took from just one or two pieces. There was a miscommunication here. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that she wasn't respecting his purchase or that she was being inconsiderate by ruining the pizza he paid for. However, she didn't ask for a whole slice, and the author didn't specify that she should take a slice. She took what she wanted, which is understandable. But the fact that she took from every piece might have been excessive, and the author felt it was selfish. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled this better. Instead of immediately getting angry and calling her names, he could have calmly explained his expectations. The argument escalated because of the strong language and the accusations. The girlfriend was confused and thought she was within her rights to take what she wanted. \n\nSo, determining who's in the wrong here might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some relationships, sharing food is expected, and taking toppings off without asking might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author didn't set clear boundaries beforehand. He didn't specify that she should take a whole slice, so maybe she didn't realize the issue. \n\nThe author's reaction was probably out of proportion to the actual action. Taking toppings off a pizza isn't a big deal for some people, but for others, especially if they paid for it and wanted to enjoy it as is, it could be a problem. The argument might have been avoidable if both had communicated better. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's anger might be understandable, his reaction was harsh and led to an argument. The main issue is the lack of communication from both sides. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be that he isn't entirely at fault. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but the initial decision to order the pizza and not clarify with his girlfriend contributed to the misunderstanding. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) was probably too harsh. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but it's a bit nuanced. Alternatively, maybe A because he started the fight. Hmm.\n"
