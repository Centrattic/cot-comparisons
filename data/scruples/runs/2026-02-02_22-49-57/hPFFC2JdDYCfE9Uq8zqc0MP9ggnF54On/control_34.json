It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about pizza. The author ordered an expensive pizza they really wanted, and their girlfriend said she'd just have some of whatever they get. The author took two pieces, then went to the living room. When they went to the kitchen later, the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and they had a big argument.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author thought the girlfriend would take toppings off one or two slices, perhaps as a way to get some without taking a whole piece. But instead, she removed toppings from all the pieces, which might make the pizza less enjoyable for the author. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from the fact that they wanted the pizza as it was, maybe because they were craving it a lot. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author had already taken their two pieces, the rest was fair game. But the author's reaction was to call her selfish and escalate into an argument. \n\nBut wait, was there a clear communication issue? The author asked if she wanted anything and she said no, but then expected her to take toppings off the remaining slices. The girlfriend might not have realized that the author would be upset if she altered all the slices. The author's assumption was that she would only take from a couple, but she did it to all. \n\nIs it reasonable to get angry over this? Pizza is a food, and while it's a personal preference, maybe the author's reaction was a bit over the top. However, the girlfriend's action could be seen as taking something that the author had bought and ordered specifically. The confusion might have led to the argument. \n\nThe author says they know it's just pizza, but they feel the anger is justified because of the girlfriend's \"selfishness.\" But was the girlfriend actually being selfish? If she took the toppings off all the slices, maybe she didn't consider that the author might want to eat them as they were. However, the author had already taken their own pieces, so maybe the rest was available. But the girlfriend altered all the pizza, which the author might have considered wasteful or inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Possibly, if they didn't communicate clearly. They ordered the pizza, but maybe they should have specified that they wanted the remaining slices to stay intact. On the flip side, the girlfriend might not have thought to ask if it was okay to modify the pizza. \n\nThe author's actions: They ordered the pizza, took two slices, and then got upset when the rest were altered. The girlfriend's actions: She took toppings off all the pieces without asking, leading to the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed the girlfriend understood their preference, but she didn't. The argument could have been avoided by either party clarifying their needs. However, the author's response was to call the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which might be seen as an overreaction given that the pizza is shared. But the girlfriend's action of altering all the pieces without discussion could also be seen as inconsiderate to the author's craving. \n\nBalance is needed here. If the author was really hungry and wanted the pizza as is, but the girlfriend modified all the remaining slices, that's a problem. However, the author's initial reaction of anger leading to a big argument might have been disproportionate. The girlfriend's confusion and the author's accusations could have been handled better. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's anger was justified. Since they both have points, but the argument was over pizza, maybe the author is in the wrong for blowing it out of proportion. But I'm not sure. The girlfriend's action was definitely inconsiderate, but maybe the author could have communicated better. It's a bit of a toss-up. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is the argument and the reaction, then A (yes) might be the answer. If the girlfriend's action is the main issue, then B (no). \n\nI think the answer is A because the author didn't communicate their preferences clearly and reacted angrily, which caused the argument. The girlfriend might not have known that the author would be upset. So the author could be in the wrong for not setting clear expectations and overreacting.\n"
