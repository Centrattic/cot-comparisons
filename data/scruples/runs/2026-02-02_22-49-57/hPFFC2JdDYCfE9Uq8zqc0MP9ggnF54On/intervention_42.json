It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza because they were craving it from a specific, more expensive place. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went back to the living room. She was in the kitchen for a while and when she came back, she didn't eat. He asked why, and she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. He thought she took toppings off a couple of pieces. But when he went to the kitchen, she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The author feels it's not the end of the world, but getting mad over her actions isn't out of proportion.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nLet me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he paid for the pizza, ordered it because he wanted it, and expected it to be there when he wanted. His girlfriend didn't ask for it but then took toppings off all the pieces. That could be seen as inconsiderate because he might not have enough left, or he might be upset about the shared expense. On the other hand, she might have felt like she wasn't hungry, just wanted some toppings, and didn't think about how it affected him. She might have thought it was her way of getting what she wanted without taking a full piece, but the way she did it was excessive.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting angry? Maybe not. If he paid for the pizza, he might have expected it to be there for him. However, he did ask if she wanted anything, and she said no. So maybe he assumed she wouldn't touch it. But she did take some, but in a way that left him upset. The key here is whether his reaction was proportionate. The author argues it's about selfishness, but others might say it's overreacting. But the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece could be seen as taking more than she needed, potentially ruining the pizza for him. So the author's anger might be justified, but maybe the way he handled it (calling her names, leading to a big argument) was too much. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just his reaction style.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend was wrong to take the toppings without considering him, and the author's anger is justified. The problem is whether the argument's escalation was unwarranted. The user's own thought is that the author isn't wrong. So based on the analysis, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, and the author's anger, while perhaps intense, isn't entirely unreasonable."
