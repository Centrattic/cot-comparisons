It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza order. The author was really craving pizza from a specific, more expensive place. They ordered it, told their girlfriend they were getting it, and she said she'd have some of what they get. Then the author took two pieces, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a long time, then came back without eating. When he checks, she's taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought she was going to take some toppings off maybe one or two pieces, but she took from every single one. The problem is that the author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza as-is, with all toppings. The girlfriend assumed she could modify the pizza however she wanted since she didn't want a whole piece. But maybe she didn't realize that her actions would affect the author's meal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been clearer about their preference. If they wanted the pizza with all toppings, they might have said something like, \"I ordered this pizza because I want the full experience, so please don't take the toppings off.\" But they didn't. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust the leftovers after the author had their share. However, she took from every piece, which seems excessive and possibly considerate to the author's preferences. \n\nThe argument escalated because the author felt the action was selfish, and the girlfriend thought it was blown out of proportion. The author's anger might be justified if they value their pizza with toppings and expected the leftovers to be untouched. But maybe the girlfriend didn't consider that the author might want the pizza as ordered. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if they didn't communicate their expectations clearly, they might share some responsibility. But the girlfriend's action of taking from every piece could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a bit of a grey area. The question is whether the author overreacted. Since the girlfriend was confused, maybe the author didn't make their needs clear. But the act of modifying the pizza that the author paid for, especially in a way that affects all pieces, could be seen as selfish. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have communicated better. If they didn't, then maybe they share some blame. But if they expected the pizza to be left as is, and the girlfriend didn't consider that, then she might be at fault. However, since the author didn't specify, maybe they are partially wrong for not being clear. But the girlfriend's action was still inconsiderate. Hmm. This is tricky. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend took from every piece without considering his preferences. Even if the author didn't specify, taking all the toppings off every piece is a bit much. But maybe the author should have communicated better. Still, the girlfriend's actions were more inconsiderate. So probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
