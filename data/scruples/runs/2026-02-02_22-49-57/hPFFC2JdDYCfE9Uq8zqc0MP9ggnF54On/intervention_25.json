It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is a bit pricey but worth it. They ordered it, offered some to their girlfriend, who declined but said she'd have some of what he gets. He takes two pieces to the living room, and while he's there, she's in the kitchen. When he checks, she didn't eat any, but she took toppings off all the pizza pieces. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for getting upset. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author ordered the pizza with the understanding that the girlfriend might have some. He assumed she'd take a piece or part of one. But instead, she modified all the pizza, which he found selfish. She thought it was fine because he had his pieces. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he paid for the pizza, intended to share, and she took away parts of all the pizza without considering his preference. He's upset she didn't just take a piece or leave his untouched. He calls her selfish, which is strong, but maybe justified if she did take a lot. \n\nBut the girlfriend thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole piece. Maybe she wanted to have some of the toppings without eating the whole pizza. However, taking toppings off all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate because it affects the author's pizza. If she wanted a few toppings, maybe she could have asked to have a separate piece or maybe she should have communicated better.\n\nThe author's reaction is anger and calling her selfish. That's a strong reaction, but maybe if they had discussed it beforehand, the issue could have been avoided. The problem is that the author didn't mention wanting her to take a piece, and she didn't clarify when she said she wanted some of the toppings. So both might share some responsibility in communication. \n\nBut the main point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend took toppings from all the pizza without asking, that's inconsiderate. However, the author could have considered that maybe she didn't want a whole piece and that she would take some toppings. But he might have expected her to leave his pieces alone. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe he overreacted. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pizza without considering his preference could be seen as selfish. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut then, the argument escalated. The author called her names and she got defensive. Maybe both have issues. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If the girlfriend did something inconsiderate, the author's anger isn't entirely unreasonable. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
