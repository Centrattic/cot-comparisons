She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza incident. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author ordered expensive pizza from a specific place they really wanted. They told their girlfriend they were going to order it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he went to the kitchen, he found the remaining pizza had toppings and cheese removed from every piece. She explained she just wanted some toppings, not the whole piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and a big argument ensued.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author overreact? The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but then took from the pizza after he had his two pieces. The author's reaction was anger, calling her selfish, and they ended up in a big fight. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as taking without permission. She said she would have some of what he got, but when he ordered, she ended up modifying the remaining pizza. He might feel that since he ordered it specifically, she shouldn't have taken from it without his consent. On the other hand, maybe she thought since he had already had his two pieces, the rest was up for grabs. But the author was expecting the pizza for himself, and she altering it might have been a breach of that understanding.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he ordered the pizza, but he did offer her the option to get something. She declined. Then, when he had his two slices, she took from the rest. The fact that she took toppings and cheese off all the pieces could be seen as wasteful or inconsiderate, especially if the author was looking forward to eating the pizza as it was. However, the author's response was to call her selfish and start a big argument. That might be seen as an overreaction, especially if the relationship tends to escalate over minor issues. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that it's a display of selfishness. The girlfriend took what she wanted without considering his feelings. On the flip side, maybe she didn't realize the extent of his attachment to the pizza. The initial agreement was a bit ambiguous\u2014she said she'd have some of what he got, but didn't specify how much. So maybe communication was lacking. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some fault. The author ordered the pizza without considering that she might want some, even after saying no. She took from the pizza without asking. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he was the one who initiated the argument by calling her names and escalating the situation, perhaps he's at fault for overreacting. But if he felt she was being inconsiderate by taking his food without permission, then maybe he's justified. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, if someone is getting defensive and using strong language (like calling someone selfish and inconsiderate), that's often seen as contributing to the problem. The girlfriend's response might have been passive-aggressive, but the author's aggressive reaction is also a problem. However, the core issue is whether taking the pizza without permission was wrong. If the author's order was intended for both but the girlfriend took without consent, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he didn't clarify that the pizza was for both, then maybe he's partially at fault. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't specify that the pizza was just for him, so the girlfriend might have thought it was shared. However, once he had his two slices and she took from the rest, that's where the problem started. The author's anger leading to a fight is the main issue. So probably, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and his reaction, while heated, might be a response to that. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe both are at fault. But the question is strictly if the author is in the wrong. Given the information, B seems more likely.\n"
