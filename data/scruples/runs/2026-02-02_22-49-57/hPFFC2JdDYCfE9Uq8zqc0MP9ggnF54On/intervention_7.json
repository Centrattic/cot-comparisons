It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves a girlfriend taking toppings off every piece after the author ordered and ate some.\n\nFirst, the author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, and their girlfriend initially said she'd have some of what they get. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he returned, she said she took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he ordered the pizza he was craving, and she agreed to have some of it. But then she took toppings off all the pieces, which he found selfish. The key points here are consent and communication. When he ordered the pizza, he might have assumed they were sharing it, but she changed the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment. She didn't communicate her actions beforehand, which could be inconsiderate. However, he could have checked the pizza before eating more or communicated his expectations when ordering. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions of altering the pizza without discussion might be selfish, but the author's reaction could be seen as overreacting. However, since pizza is a shared expense and she changed what was ordered, there's a valid point in being upset. It's a matter of expectations and respect for each other's preferences. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe there's room for both sides. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since she altered the pizza without discussing, the author's anger is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
