It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who started a fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. The argument ensued, and the author feels justified because they thought the girlfriend took what she wanted without considering others.\n\nFirst, communication seems key here. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever the author got. That implies the author might have expected her to take some pieces or at least not modify the remaining ones. But the girlfriend didn't take whole pieces, just toppings. Maybe she thought she was being considerate by saving the author's share? But taking from all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate if it's the only pizza they have.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of removing toppings from every piece could be seen as selfish, but maybe she didn't realize the impact. The author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which might be an overreaction if the girlfriend didn't take all the food. However, the fact that she took parts from every piece might have made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for the author, who was already looking forward to it.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might have thought she was sharing, but she didn't consider that the author would value the toppings. The author's frustration is understandable if they had a craving and the pizza was modified in a way that made it less satisfying. On the flip side, the author didn't clarify if the girlfriend wanted whole pieces or not, so maybe there was a communication breakdown.\n\nThe argument escalated because both sides didn't see each other's perspective. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for getting upset over their expectations not being met, especially since the girlfriend's actions affected the author's enjoyment. However, calling someone selfish and inconsiderate could be harsh if the girlfriend didn't realize she was being inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, the main issue is the lack of communication and differing expectations. The author's anger isn't entirely unfounded, but their reaction might have been more intense than necessary. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author could have handled it more calmly. So the answer leans towards B (author not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides.\n"
