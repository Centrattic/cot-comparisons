It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves a girlfriend who ordered pizza she really wanted, paid a bit more for a specific place. She asked her girlfriend if she wanted something, and the girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever the author gets. The author then orders, eats two slices, goes to watch TV.\n\nThe girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, the author notices she didn't eat. The girlfriend says she wanted toppings, but the author thought she took toppings off a couple of pieces. But in reality, the girlfriend took toppings and cheese off every single piece. The author gets upset, calls her selfish, they argue, and bring up other issues.\n\nSo the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that the girlfriend would only take from one or two slices, but instead, the girlfriend took from all of them. The girlfriend was confused because she thought the author had already taken his share, so the pizza was fair game. The author felt that the girlfriend was inconsiderate by taking from all the pieces, making the pizza less enjoyable for him. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought it was fine because she took only what she wanted and left the rest.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author did ask the girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said yes. So the expectation might have been that the author would split the pizza, but maybe not to the extent of taking toppings off all pieces. The girlfriend's action of removing toppings from every piece could be seen as taking more than reasonable, but maybe the author overreacted by calling her selfish and escalating to a fight. However, the girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't realize the impact of her actions. The author's anger might be justified if he felt the act was selfish, but the way the argument escalated could be his fault if he didn't communicate his feelings calmly.\n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend might not have considered the author's preferences when removing toppings, leading to a conflict. But the author could have clarified his expectations earlier. The problem is that both sides have valid points, but whether the author is in the wrong depends on how reasonable their reaction was. Since the author took two slices first and the girlfriend was in the kitchen, maybe he should have checked if she was taking any. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces might have been excessive. The argument over pizza leading to a big fight might have been unnecessary, but the author's initial anger isn't entirely unwarranted. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, even if the reaction was intense. However, the author could have handled it better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer options are A or B, maybe B (No) is the answer because the author's anger isn't out of proportion given the girlfriend's actions, even if the argument could have been handled better. The girlfriend's confusion doesn't absolve her of being inconsiderate, so the author's reaction is understandable.\n"
