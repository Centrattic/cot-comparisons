It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a pizza fight between the author and their girlfriend. The author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they really wanted it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of what the author gets. Then the author takes two pieces and starts watching TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when the author checks, she says she didn't take all the toppings off but had removed some. The author gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They asked the girlfriend if she wanted pizza and she said yes. So presumably, the author ordered enough for both. When the pizza arrived, the author took two pieces. But the girlfriend was in the kitchen and then came back without eating. The author thought she took toppings off, but she actually removed chunks from every piece. The author got angry because they felt it was selfish.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective: She said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author assumed she meant taking a few toppings off a couple of pieces. But she took from all pieces, leaving them inedible for the author. She then got defensive, saying the author was overreacting.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, the author asked if she wanted pizza, she said yes. The author provided pizza, but when the girlfriend altered the pizza in a way that made it unpalatable, the author was upset. The key point here is consent and shared expectations. The author might have expected the pizza to be shared as ordered. The girlfriend's actions made the pizza unappetizing, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's reaction was calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger stems from the girlfriend's actions making the pizza less enjoyable. The girlfriend didn't communicate her preference properly. The author could have ordered two different pizzas, but they didn't. However, the girlfriend's behavior was not considerate. The author's anger isn't over the pizza itself but the girlfriend's selfishness. The author might have overreacted in the way they expressed their anger, but the initial action (getting angry) might not be entirely unjustified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have ordered two separate pizzas, but the girlfriend also didn't clarify her preferences. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
