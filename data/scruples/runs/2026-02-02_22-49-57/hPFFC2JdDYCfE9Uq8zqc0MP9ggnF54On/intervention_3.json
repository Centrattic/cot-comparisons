It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered an expensive pizza they were craving, and their girlfriend said she would just have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he went back to the kitchen, he found the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author was hungry, had specifically wanted pizza from a place they both know is more expensive but worth it. He ordered it because he was starving and even offered her some. She said she would have some. Then he took two pieces, which he probably thought was reasonable. But when he went to get more, he found all the toppings removed. That's a problem because he wanted to eat the pizza with its toppings as intended.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's defense is that she didn't take all the cheese and that he had already taken his pieces. She might think that since he had two pieces, the rest was fair game. But from the author's perspective, he paid for the pizza, was very specific about wanting it, and she altered it in a way that made the remaining pizza less enjoyable or inedible for him. He might feel that she didn't consider his preferences or the expense.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is that the pizza was his to eat, and she was taking from it without his consent. Even if she thought she was allowed, if he had already taken two pieces, maybe she should have communicated better. However, the act of removing toppings from all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might feel that she didn't respect his choice or his expense, leading to his anger.\n\nBut does that make him right? Well, he did call her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be harsh. However, she did alter the food in a way that affected his enjoyment. The question is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Since it's just pizza, but he was genuinely upset about her actions, maybe there's a communication issue. But if she didn't ask and just took, perhaps the author was within his right to be upset.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the girlfriend thought it was shared, so she had the right to take from it. But the author might see it as his purchase, so she shouldn't alter it. However, when you invite someone to share food, there's an expectation that you consider each other's preferences. The girlfriend might not have considered that removing toppings would make the pizza less for him, but the author might think she should have asked or taken her own portion without altering his.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's anger might be justified if he felt his needs were disregarded. But maybe he overreacted by calling her selfish and escalating it into a big argument. The key here is whether the action was inconsiderate. She took from the pizza in a way that affected him, and he was upset about it. The argument might have been avoidable with better communication, but the initial action of her altering the pizza without discussing it could be at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and his anger, while maybe intense, is a reaction to that inconsideration. So answer B.\n"
