It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user ordered a specific, expensive pizza they really wanted. They told their girlfriend about it and she said she'd have some of whatever they get. He ordered it, ate two pieces, and then later found out she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When he asked if she wanted anything, she said no but would have some of his pizza. He likely expected that she would take a portion, maybe a few toppings off a couple of slices, not go through every single piece. The girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza might have been a way to get the toppings she wanted without eating the whole pizza, but it might not have occurred to her how much this would upset him.\n\nThe author got angry because he felt it was selfish and inconsiderate. She, on the other hand, thought she was being reasonable by not taking all the cheese and not eating the entire pizza. The argument escalated, with her calling him childish. \n\nFrom a perspective of not being in the wrong, the author had a right to feel disrespected if he thought she was taking without considering his preferences or the effort he made to get that pizza. However, maybe the author overreacted by calling her selfish and inconsiderate without understanding her reasoning. \n\nBut considering that he had already eaten two pieces and she was in the kitchen for a long time, maybe he could have checked on the pizza sooner. However, the main issue is the lack of communication. She didn't clarify that she wanted to take toppings off all pieces, and he didn't check the pizza until later.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both might have miscommunication here. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, his anger was based on her actions affecting his pizza. If he's okay with sharing and modifying the pizza, then maybe she's not wrong. But if he felt it was selfish, perhaps his reaction is a bit harsh, but not entirely unreasonable given his perspective.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, considering that his reaction led to a fight, maybe A (Yes) could be argued. But I think the main fault lies with the girlfriend for not communicating her needs better. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
