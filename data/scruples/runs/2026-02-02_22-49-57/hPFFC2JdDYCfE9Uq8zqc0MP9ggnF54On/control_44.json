It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what happened. The author ordered pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just wanted some of the pizza they ordered. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he went to the kitchen, he found that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she thought it was a big deal, and they fought.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author ordered the pizza because they were craving it. They shared it with their girlfriend, who initially said she didn't want anything but later took parts of the pizza. The author expected her to take maybe one or two pieces' toppings, but she did it to all. The author felt it was selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they paid for the pizza, were excited to eat it, and now their girlfriend messed up all the pieces, making it not enjoyable for them. They might feel that their request was not respected\u2014since she said she would just have some of whatever he got, but then took from all the pieces, leaving him with less enjoyable food.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective might be that she didn't want a whole piece and just wanted some toppings. She thought it was okay because the author already had their two pieces. She might not have realized that removing toppings from all the pizza would ruin the experience for him.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and relationships, sharing food is common, but there's an expectation of mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't ask first, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author might have been too quick to anger, escalating the situation. But the girlfriend's action did affect the author's meal, which he paid for. \n\nIs it a big deal? It's subjective. Some might say it's overreacting, but others might see it as a valid reaction to having their meal ruined. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to remain intact, and the girlfriend didn't ask before taking the toppings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author called her selfish and called her a child, maybe he overstepped. However, the initial action of her taking the toppings without asking might be the root cause. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. Since the author was clear he was craving the pizza, and the girlfriend altered it without permission, leading to conflict. The author's anger might be justified if he felt his preferences were not respected. However, escalating to a big argument could be seen as his fault. But the main issue is her action versus his reaction. \n\nIn many cases, these situations are about communication. If the author had specified that he wanted the pizza as-is, or if she had asked, maybe it would have been avoided. But based on the given info, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset, especially if he paid for the pizza and she altered his meal without consent. However, the argument's escalation is where the author might take responsibility. Yet, the initial problem is her action. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action of altering the pizza without asking could be seen as inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. However, arguing about it might be the problem, but the core issue is her action. So maybe it's a 50-50, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the prompt says \"AITA for starting a fight over pizza?\" implying the author started the fight. But technically, the fight was caused by her action. The author started the argument, but was it justified? Depending on perspective. But the answer options are A or B. Given that, maybe B is better. Or perhaps A because the author could have handled it without a fight. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user is the author, and he's asking if he's in the wrong. The girlfriend took the toppings without asking, but the author didn't specify. However, he ordered it for himself, expecting to eat it as is. She might not have realized that. So, the author's anger is about the action, but the argument started when he confronted her. So maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of the answer, I think the majority of people would say the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend took something without permission, but the author's reaction might be seen as over the top. However, given the situation, it's a matter of opinion. Since the user is asking the community for an AITA (Am I the Asshole) answer, the typical response would be B (No), meaning the author isn't the asshole. Because the girlfriend did something that affected his meal without asking. But others might say that it's a minor issue and the author acted inconsiderate by starting a fight over it. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer is B (No) because the core issue is her action without communication, and the author was upset, but not entirely wrong to be upset. The argument escalation is a problem, but the main issue is her side. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
