It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered a specific pizza they were craving, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, she said no but later took toppings off all the pieces. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and wanted a specific type. The girlfriend initially said she would just have some of whatever the author got. But when the pizza arrived, she ended up taking toppings off every piece, which the author found inconsiderate. The author felt justified in being angry because they thought the girlfriend was being selfish. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not have realized the impact of her actions or thought it was a big deal.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that the girlfriend taking \"some toppings\" meant using one or two pieces, but she took from all of them. The author didn't check in again after the initial offer, so maybe they could have clarified if the girlfriend wanted to take some. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces might have ruined what the author was looking forward to, which is understandable. \n\nBut the author's reaction was to call the girlfriend selfish and start an argument. Getting angry over this situation might be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't explicitly ask for the pizza and later took from it. The author could have approached it calmly, explaining how they felt instead of immediately confronting her. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pizza without considering the author's preference could be seen as inconsiderate. If the author had mentioned that they wanted to eat the pizza as is, the girlfriend might have respected that. But since the author didn't clarify, maybe the expectation was unclear.\n\nSo, where's the fault here? The author might share some responsibility for not checking in again or not clearly stating they wanted to eat the pizza as ordered. The girlfriend took it without considering the author's needs. However, the author's reaction was to escalate the situation with anger and name-calling, which isn't helpful. The girlfriend's confusion and the author's labeling her as selfish could have been handled better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because the author overreacted. If B (no), then the author isn't wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. However, considering both sides, the author could have handled it more calmly. The initial anger might be justified, but the way it was handled could be better. The answer might depend on cultural context or relationship dynamics. However, the question is about right or wrong, not about who is more at fault. \n\nSince the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that the author called the girlfriend selfish and started an argument, which escalated the situation, perhaps the answer is A. However, if the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, then the author isn't wrong. But the problem is the lack of communication. The author didn't clarify the expectations, and the girlfriend didn't ask. Both might share some responsibility. But the question is specifically about the author. Since the author started the fight, maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if the action was justified, then no. \n\nI think the answer is A because the author's reaction was disproportionate. Even if the girlfriend did something inconsiderate, the author's approach was to start a fight. It's possible that a calm discussion could have resolved it without blame. So the author's fault is in how they reacted, not necessarily the initial anger. So the answer is A.\n"
