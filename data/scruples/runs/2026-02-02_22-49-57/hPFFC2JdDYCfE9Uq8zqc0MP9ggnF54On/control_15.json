It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place, which is a bit more expensive but worth it. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets.\n\nHe orders it, eats two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, he notices she isn't eating. She says she took toppings and cheese off every piece, not just one or two. The author is upset, calls her selfish, and they argue. The girlfriend says he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author ordered the pizza for himself and offered the girlfriend some. She said yes, so he expected her to take some. But instead of just taking a piece or a few, she took toppings off all the pieces. The author is upset because he thinks that's selfish. But is he overreacting?\n\nWell, maybe he should have considered that she might prefer just the toppings. However, by taking chunks off every piece, she's ruining the pizza for him. He paid for it, and now it's not as enjoyable. On the other hand, she might have thought it was okay since he had already eaten two pieces. But then again, she didn't eat anything else, so maybe she was just being inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because his girlfriend altered the food he paid for without his consent. But was his reaction appropriate? He called her selfish and inconsiderate, and the argument escalated. The girlfriend might have a point if she felt he was being too sensitive. But the act of taking toppings off all the pieces could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author's right to be upset about his pizza being ruined, but his reaction might have been harsh. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but maybe she didn't realize how much it would bother him. So, is the author in the wrong for overreacting, or is he justified? The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nIn these situations, it's often about communication. The author could have asked her to just take a piece instead of messing with all of them. But he didn't, and the girlfriend didn't consider that he might not want the pizza altered. So both might have some responsibility. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer probably hinges on whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. Since the girlfriend did alter the food he paid for, maybe he isn't in the wrong. But if he overreacted by calling her names and escalating the argument, that's his fault. The key is whether the initial anger was justified or not.\n\nI think the author's anger is somewhat justified because his girlfriend took from all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. But his reaction of calling her names and the argument might be his part. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the main issue is the girlfriend's action, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if his reaction was the main issue, then he is. Since the post says \"starting a fight over pizza,\" the main question is about the fight. The author did start the fight by getting angry, which escalated into an argument. So maybe he's the one who started it, making him the asshole. But the girlfriend's actions might have been the trigger. It's a bit of a toss-up. In many AITA scenarios, the person who initiates the conflict is the one in the wrong, but if the conflict is due to a valid grievance, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's inconsiderate action led to the argument. The author had a right to be upset about his pizza being ruined, even if his reaction was a bit harsh. The main issue is her taking the toppings without considering his feelings. So the author isn't in the wrong for getting angry, even if the fight over pizza seems minor. The key is her actions were the problem, not his reaction.\n"
