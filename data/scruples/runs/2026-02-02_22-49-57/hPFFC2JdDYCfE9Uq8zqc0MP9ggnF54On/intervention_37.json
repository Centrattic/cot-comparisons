It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So the situation is that the author ordered pizza, told his girlfriend he was getting it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, but wanted some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV, and she was in the kitchen. Then when he went to get more, he found she took toppings off every piece.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author thought she was going to take just a bit, maybe a topping off a couple of pieces. But she took from all of them. The girlfriend's version is that she didn't take all the cheese, and the author called her selfish and inconsiderate. She got annoyed and he acted like a child.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe he overreacted? But maybe she did something inconsiderate. The question is whether his reaction was justified. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. \n\nFirst, let's consider the setup. The author asked if she wanted anything, she said she'd have some of what he got. So he ordered for both. Then she ends up taking from the pizza, which he might have expected her to take a piece or part of a piece. But she took from all the pieces. That could be seen as selfish if he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. But maybe he didn't consider that she couldn't have a piece on her own and needed to take from his order. \n\nBut maybe the problem was miscommunication. The author might have assumed she would take a piece or part of a piece, but she took from all of them. So he's upset because the pizza he ordered wasn't there as he expected. On the other hand, she might have felt that since he had already taken two pieces, she could take some from the rest. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the pizza whole, but he might have expected that she would take what she needed without altering the remaining pizza. She might not have realized that he would mind. However, if he didn't clarify that he wanted to eat the pizza as is, maybe he's responsible for not setting that expectation. \n\nBut the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every single piece could be seen as inconsiderate because it ruined the pizza for the author. Even if he had two pieces, the rest is for both of them. If she took from all the remaining pieces, that's not just taking her share but affecting what's left. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified if he felt that she didn't consider his desire to eat the pizza as ordered. However, the argument escalated, and calling her selfish might have been harsh. But the initial reaction over something as trivial as pizza could be seen as overreacting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, he didn't set clear expectations about how the pizza should be handled. On the other hand, her action of altering all the pizza might have been selfish. The argument might have been avoidable with better communication from both sides. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author called her selfish and got into an argument, maybe he's partly at fault for overreacting. But if he felt disrespected by her taking from all the pizza, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nIn the end, it's a situation where both could have communicated better. But the user's stance is that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), but maybe there's a nuance. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend took the toppings off every piece, which is more than just taking a piece. That's altering the food in a way that affects the experience for both. The author's anger might be justified because she didn't consider his preference. However, if the pizza was ordered for both, maybe she had a right to take from it. \n\nBut the key is that she took from all pieces, not just one or two. That's more inconsiderate. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
