It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering pizza, eating two pieces, and then finding out their girlfriend took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. The girlfriend was initially confused when the author got angry, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author ordered pizza, expecting it to be shared, and the girlfriend did take some toppings but maybe didn't communicate her intentions. The author feels the girlfriend was selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't take all the toppings and thought it was still edible. She might not have realized the author would be upset.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that sharing food is a given, especially when they offered the pizza to their partner. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as not respecting the shared meal, especially when the author had already taken their own pieces. The author's anger could stem from feeling that their partner didn't consider their feelings or the effort they made to get the pizza.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might argue that she was just taking what she wanted and didn't take all the toppings, leaving the pizza still edible. She might not have intended to be inconsiderate and was confused by the author's reaction. The argument might have escalated because of miscommunication or differing expectations about sharing food.\n\nConsidering cultural norms, people often share food in relationships, and taking toppings off all pieces might be seen as selfish. But it's possible the girlfriend thought she was being reasonable, taking some without eating the whole pizza. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting if the girlfriend didn't take all the pizza, but the act of taking toppings off all pieces without discussion could be inconsiderate.\n\nThe key points are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that they expected the pizza to be untouched after their two pieces, perhaps. The girlfriend didn't ask if it was okay to take toppings, assuming it was a shared meal. The author's anger might be justified if the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful, but the reaction's intensity (calling her selfish, leading to a big argument) could be seen as over the top.\n\nIn AITA situations, the focus is on whether the action was reasonable. The author's anger over shared food might be understandable, but the argument's escalation suggests both parties could have handled it better. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces without discussion might tip the balance towards the author being justified in their feelings, even if the argument was disproportionate. So the answer might lean towards B (author not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
