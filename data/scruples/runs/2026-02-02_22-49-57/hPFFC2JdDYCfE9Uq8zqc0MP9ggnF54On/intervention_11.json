It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author ordered expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and left the rest. The girlfriend came in later and took toppings off every piece, not just one or two. The author got upset and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the details. The author mentioned craving pizza all day and choosing a more expensive place, which might indicate it was important to them. They offered the girlfriend some pizza, expecting she might take a piece or part of it. Instead, she took toppings off all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate because it made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for them.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She said she didn't want a whole piece but took toppings from every piece. That's a bit odd. If she didn't want a whole piece, maybe taking a few toppings from one piece would have been reasonable. But taking from all pieces could be seen as not considering the author's preferences, especially if the author values the toppings on their pizza.\n\nThe author's reaction: They felt justified in getting angry over what they saw as selfishness. The girlfriend, however, felt the author was overreacting. The key here is perspective. The author might feel their enjoyment of the pizza was compromised, while the girlfriend thought it was fine since she didn't take all the toppings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't specify their preferences beforehand, like how they wanted to share the pizza. The girlfriend also didn't clarify her intentions when she said she'd take some toppings. Both might have had different expectations. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The fight started because the girlfriend took from all pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. However, the author could have considered that the girlfriend might not know how the author likes their pizza, or maybe the girlfriend thought it was fair since the author had already eaten two pieces. \n\nBut the act of taking toppings off every piece does seem excessive if the goal was just to have some toppings, not to ruin the author's pizza. The girlfriend's action might have been inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted. However, the author could have handled the situation more calmly instead of escalating it into an argument. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response\u2014being confused and calling the author a child\u2014might have been more dismissive. The argument escalated because of how both reacted. But the initial act of taking toppings off all pieces without considering the author's preferences could be seen as selfish, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, while the author's reaction might be intense, their anger isn't entirely unwarranted given the circumstances. The girlfriend's action did affect the author's enjoyment. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
