It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza for themselves, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. Then, after he ate two pieces, she came back and had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author ordered pizza specifically because he was craving it and even mentioned it's more expensive but worth it. He asked her if she wanted anything, and she said she'd take some of what he got. So he might have expected her to take a piece or maybe even share from the same pizza he had. However, when she came back, instead of taking a piece or maybe part of one, she took toppings and cheese from all the pieces. \n\nNow, the author's reaction was anger, calling her selfish. The girlfriend's response was confusion and saying he was acting like a child. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom the author's point of view, he ordered the pizza intending to eat it, and he might have thought that by offering her some, she would take a piece. When she instead took the toppings off all the pieces, he could feel like his personal choice to eat the pizza as he wanted was being taken away. The fact that she took from every piece might have been more than just taking a small amount; he mentions \"every fucking piece,\" which implies she took a lot. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he had already taken two pieces, she could take some toppings from the remaining ones without him getting upset. She might not have considered that he wanted the pizza with all the toppings, or that he felt ownership over the pizza he ordered. Also, she might have thought it was a shared purchase, so she had the right to take what she wanted from it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't specify that the pizza was for him alone when he ordered it. He asked if she wanted anything, so she might have assumed it was okay to take some. However, the way she took toppings from every piece could be seen as overstepping, especially if he was still intending to eat the rest. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional response. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. Even if he felt wronged, the way he reacted might have been harsh. The girlfriend's response was defensive, which could be a result of feeling accused without understanding the full context. \n\nBut then again, the author's frustration is understandable. The pizza was expensive and he had a specific craving. If she took toppings from all the pieces, making the remaining pizza less appealing to him, that could be seen as selfish. However, the initial assumption was that she would take a piece, not modify the pizza he had ordered. \n\nIt's also possible that the author didn't communicate his expectations clearly. He might have assumed that ordering pizza for himself meant it was for him alone, but when he asked her if she wanted anything, he might have implied that she could take some. In that case, her taking toppings from all pieces without checking could be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's anger might be justified if he feels that his personal choice was being undermined. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and escalating to a big argument might have been over the top. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, but her confusion and defensive response also play a role. \n\nIn terms of who is more in the wrong, it might be a bit of both. The author might have not communicated his intentions clearly, and the girlfriend might have taken more than she should have. But the question is specifically about the author. If the author is in the wrong, it could be because he started a fight over an issue that might not have been a major one, especially since pizza is not the end of the world. However, if his feelings were genuinely hurt because she took toppings from all the pieces, then his reaction might be understandable. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but the answer options are A or B. So, based on the analysis, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's frustration is about a personal choice being affected, and while the argument escalated, the initial action (taking toppings from all pieces) could be seen as selfish. However, the reaction's intensity is debatable. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the context, the answer leans towards B.\n"
