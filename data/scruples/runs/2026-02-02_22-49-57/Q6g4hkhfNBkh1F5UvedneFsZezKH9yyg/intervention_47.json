During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation is complicated because there's no actual cheating, just ongoing contact with an ex. The author has evidence of the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact through social media, even after promises to delete or block them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has a child together, so the decision to end the marriage is significant. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continuously liking ex's photos, not deleting her as agreed, and even unblocking her again\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional betrayal might be a factor here. The author felt the need to check the phone, which is a red flag, but maybe it's understandable given the repeated issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to evaluate that. In relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner can't respect boundaries set by the other, the relationship might be doomed. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut off contact despite promises might indicate a lack of commitment to the marriage. The author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but the pattern repeats. So, leaving could be a reasonable decision to protect their own well-being and their child's future.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped and that could be a breach of trust itself. But the fianc\u00e9's actions forced the author to take that step. Also, the fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of dishonesty and not following through, which could justify the author's decision. Since there's no evidence of cheating, but there is consistent emotional unavailability and breach of trust, it's a tough call. But in the end, the author's decision is about their own peace of mind and the integrity of the relationship. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
