During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement with a son, and the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another woman despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the facts. The couple broke up once before, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to stop contact. They had fights about it, and he deleted her from social media, but later it's revealed he kept her blocked and unblocked again. There's evidence of him liking her and her sister's posts repeatedly, even after promising to stop. The author found out multiple times and each time he swore to delete her, but it kept happening again. Now, the author is considering breaking up over this.\n\nThe key question here is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to determine based on the situation.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not following through on promises to cut off contact. The author has legitimate reasons to feel betrayed, especially given the repeated breaches of trust. Even if there's no actual cheating, the constant contact and the effort to hide it (blocking and unblocking, liking posts) can be seen as emotional infidelity. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again suggests he's not respecting the author's boundaries, which the author has the right to set.\n\nThe author has a child with this person, so the relationship's impact on their son is also a factor. However, the main issue here is the ongoing contact despite multiple chances. The author's decision to leave is based on the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor commitments and maintain trust. \n\nIn such cases, it's often considered a valid reason to end a relationship if one partner can't respect the other's boundaries. The author isn't making accusations of cheating but of persistent, deceitful behavior that undermines trust. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they're acting to protect the relationship's integrity and their own emotional well-being.\n"
