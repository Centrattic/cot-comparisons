During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after a seven-year relationship. The main issue here is about whether staying in contact with another woman, even without explicit cheating, justifies ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up once for a month three years ago. During that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known a long time. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact. He tried deleting her from social media, but later the author found out he was still in touch, liking her posts, etc. There were multiple instances where the author found out he was reconnecting, and even after promises, he kept unblocking them again.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're in the wrong for leaving. They have evidence of ongoing contact but no actual cheating. The question is about whether the author is justified in ending the relationship.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, this might be a breach of trust and boundaries. In a committed relationship, even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional or digital contact can be seen as a violation, especially if it's ongoing and the partner keeps breaking promises. The author's feelings of being betrayed and not being respected are valid. They took the step of checking the phone because they felt the need to confirm, which might be a point of contention, but the core issue is the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor the relationship's boundaries.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating and that the contact is innocent. However, the pattern of hiding and reconnecting suggests a lack of transparency and respect. The fact that he had to unblock them intentionally, even after previous promises, indicates he might not be taking the author's concerns seriously.\n\nIn long-term relationships, especially with children involved, trust and consistency are crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's trust without genuine effort to change, it can be reasonable to leave. The author's decision is based on the belief that the relationship can't be healthy without the necessary boundaries and honesty.\n\nSo, considering the repeated breaches of trust, the lack of commitment to fix the issue, and the author's need for a respectful and trustworthy relationship, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The key here is the ongoing pattern of behavior that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't resolved, making the author's decision understandable."
