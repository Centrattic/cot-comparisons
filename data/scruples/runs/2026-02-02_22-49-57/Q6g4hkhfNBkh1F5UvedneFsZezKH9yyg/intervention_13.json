During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement, a child, and ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 contacting an old friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple broke up once for a month three years ago. During that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut off contact. He did delete her initially, but later the author found out he was still in contact through social media, even liking her pictures and the sister's. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to delete her again, which he broke. The author found out he unblocked them again and decided to leave.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, not just once but multiple times, despite promises to stop. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to like the pictures again, but the author found out he unblocked them intentionally.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Repeated violations of boundaries, even if not cheating in a physical sense, can erode trust. The author felt betrayed and decided to end the engagement. The father of their child is involved, which complicates things emotionally and practically.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the engagement. Emotionally, it's about the trust and respect between partners. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting the author's feelings and boundaries. The author's decision to leave is based on their right to feel secure and respected in the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
