During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting off contact with an ex-friend, even after multiple promises.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has a child together. They broke up briefly before, then reconciled. The author wanted the fianc\u00e9 to stop contact with a girl he's known for a long time. After several incidents where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through, the author decided to leave. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author felt that maintaining contact with this girl was a violation of the trust they had rebuilt after the breakup. The fianc\u00e9 kept re-establishing contact, even after promising to delete or block her. The author's actions, like checking the phone, might be seen as overstepping, but the context is a serious breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones with children, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks promises about cutting off contact with someone that causes significant distress, that's a major issue. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was too controlling, especially if there's no evidence of actual cheating. But the consistent behavior of the fianc\u00e9 not respecting the author's boundaries could justify the decision to end the relationship. The author's actions were in response to ongoing disrespect and broken promises, which are valid reasons for leaving. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to honor commitments and the resulting harm to the relationship are significant factors. The author had a right to prioritize their well-being and their child's stability.\n"
