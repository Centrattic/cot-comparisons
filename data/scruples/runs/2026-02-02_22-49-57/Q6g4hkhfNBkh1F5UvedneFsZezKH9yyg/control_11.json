During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is a 7-year engagement where the fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with an old friend, which the author found out through snooping. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting off contact as requested, multiple instances of liking photos and not blocking, and finally unblocking them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the one who snoop-checked the phone, which might be seen as a breach of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9 had a history of not following through on promises to cut contact, which the author found out through these checks. The author's main issue is the continuous contact despite promises to stop, leading to loss of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks promises, especially regarding boundaries the other has set, that's a problem. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries, even after being confronted multiple times. The fact that he unblocked them again after promising to block them is significant.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author resorted to snooping, which isn't healthy in a relationship. However, given the context of prior breaches, it's understandable as a way to seek reassurance. The author is left with damaged trust and no resolution, leading to the decision to end the engagement. The presence of a child complicates things, but the author isn't accusing the fianc\u00e9 of cheating, just ongoing contact which they found problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision is based on a lack of respect for boundaries and broken promises. The fianc\u00e9 is at fault for not honoring commitments, so the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. The answer should be B.\n"
