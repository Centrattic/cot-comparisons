During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be infidelity or at least emotional infidelity. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, they've been together for seven years with a child. There was a breakup a few years ago where the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known a long time. They got back together, but the author wanted him to cut all contact. He deleted her, but later it turned out he was still liking her social media posts. They fought, he deleted her again, but the author found out later he hadn't really. Then, he liked the girl's sister's posts, which he claimed was an accident. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe author is considering leaving because of this, even though there's no proof of actual cheating, just ongoing contact. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. \n\nI need to consider the context: the fianc\u00e9's actions were persistent, despite promises to stop. The author felt betrayed and took matters into their own hands by checking the phone, which might be seen as snooping. But given the situation, maybe that's understandable. The key here is whether the author's decision to leave is justified.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaches trust by not respecting boundaries (like contacting an ex), even if it's not physical cheating, it can be a deal-breaker. The author may feel that the fianc\u00e9 isn't committed to resolving the issue, leading to the decision to leave. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have addressed the issue through communication or counseling instead of ending the relationship. However, given the repeated violations and the fianc\u00e9's pattern of not following through on promises, the author might feel it's necessary to protect their own well-being and the future of their family.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No). But wait, I should check again. The author did snoop through the phone, which could be a point against them. But in the context of a troubled relationship where trust is broken, maybe that's a reasonable action. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing behavior. The author is choosing to leave because they can't trust their partner, which is a valid reason. So yes, the answer is B.\n"
