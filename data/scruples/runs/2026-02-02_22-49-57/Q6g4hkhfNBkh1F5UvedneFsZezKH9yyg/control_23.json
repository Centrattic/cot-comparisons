During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author of the scenario) is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The main issue is about her finding out he's been in contact with another girl multiple times, even after promises to cut ties. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together a long time, have a kid. There was a breakup and then they got back together. The key issue is the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an old friend, which the author found out about through snooping. The fianc\u00e9 didn't delete the contact as promised, and even liked pictures of the girl's sister. The author is leaving because of this, even without proof of cheating.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author felt betrayed and lost trust because the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to cut contact. Trust is crucial in a relationship, especially in a long-term partnership. If someone cannot follow through on commitments regarding boundaries, that can erode trust significantly.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continually not deleting the contact despite promises\u2014might be seen as disrespectful to the author's feelings and the relationship's boundaries. Even if there's no actual cheating, the ongoing contact and the effort to hide it (blocking/unblocking) could indicate emotional infidelity or at least a lack of consideration for the partner's insecurities.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped, which is a breach of privacy. But given the context of repeated issues, maybe her actions were justified in her eyes. The key point is whether the author had a valid reason to leave. Since the fianc\u00e9's behavior was a consistent problem and he couldn't follow through, the author's decision might be seen as necessary for her own well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But in the context of the information provided, the author's actions could be seen as a reasonable response to a breach of trust and respect. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
