During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for A) question is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The couple has been together for seven years, has a child together. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known his whole life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact with her, which he did initially but then kept reconnecting. The author found out through snooping that he was still in contact, liking her social media posts, even while their relationship was getting distant. There were confrontations, he promised to block her each time, but kept unblocking her. Most recently, he unblocked both the girl and her sister. The author left him, and now wonders if they're in the wrong because there's no evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author acted wrong by ending the relationship. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, trust is crucial in a long-term relationship, especially when there's a child involved. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 was not respecting their boundaries by maintaining contact with another woman despite promises. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as emotionally unfaithful, even without physical cheating. Repeated broken promises to cut contact might erode trust and indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author's decision to leave might be seen as protecting their own emotional well-being and that of their child, especially if they felt betrayed and the relationship was becoming toxic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be a breach of privacy. However, given the context of a long-term relationship and concerns about fidelity, this action might be more understandable. The fianc\u00e9's inability to sever ties with an old acquaintance could be a red flag, but it's also possible he's just struggling with setting boundaries without being unfaithful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving if they felt that the relationship was no longer healthy or trustworthy. The fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly broke the trust, and the author made a decision based on their own needs and the well-being of their family. Ending a relationship is a personal choice, and given the circumstances, it seems justified.\n"
