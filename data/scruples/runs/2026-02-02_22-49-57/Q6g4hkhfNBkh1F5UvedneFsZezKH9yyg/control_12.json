During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9. The situation is a 7-year relationship with a child, and there's been ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 contacting another girl.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the scenario. The couple had a breakup, then reunited. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact with another girl, which he initially did but then kept reconnecting. The author snooped and found evidence of ongoing contact, like liking photos on social media. The fianc\u00e9 would promise to stop each time but failed, leading the author to leave.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe user is likely looking for an analysis of whether the author's actions are justified. The main factors here are trust, repeated breaches of agreed boundaries, and the impact on the relationship. The author has evidence of ongoing contact despite promises to stop. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be considered emotionally unfaithful, even without physical cheating. The author left because of the lack of trust and repeated issues.\n\nIn many situations, when one partner can't respect agreed-upon boundaries in a committed relationship, especially in a long-term engagement with a child, the other partner is justified in ending things. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but the fianc\u00e9 kept failing to follow through, leading to the author making a difficult decision for their own well-being and that of their child.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
