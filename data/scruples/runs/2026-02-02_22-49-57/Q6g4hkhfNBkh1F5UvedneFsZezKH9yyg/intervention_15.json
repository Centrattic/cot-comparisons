During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 of seven years. The fianc\u00e9 has a child with them, and there's been a complicated history with another girl. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. They broke up a few years ago, then got back together, and the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact with the girl. There were repeated instances where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through\u2014like not deleting the girl from social media, liking her pictures, and even unblocking her after promises to stop. The author snoop-checked the phone, found more contact, and eventually decided to leave.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship. The key points are repeated breaches of trust after multiple chances. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to cut off contact, leading to the author feeling betrayed and unsupported. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. From the given information, the fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014maintaining contact despite promises, using social media to engage with another person\u2014could be seen as a violation of trust. The author had valid reasons to feel insecure and betrayed, especially given the repeated nature of these incidents. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaches that trust, even without physical infidelity, it can damage the relationship. The author's decision to leave might be seen as self-preservation, especially considering they have a child together. The fianc\u00e9's inability to sever ties could indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship, which is a legitimate reason to end things.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's decision to snoop could be problematic, but in this context, the repeated issues might justify it. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the main issue here. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
