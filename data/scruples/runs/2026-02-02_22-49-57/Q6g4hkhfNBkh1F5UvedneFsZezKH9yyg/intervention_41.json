During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years.\n\nFirst, the key points: They have a 6-year-old son. There was a breakup a few years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They reconciled, but the author expected him to cut all contact. He didn't, leading to conflicts. The author found out he was still in contact, even after he promised to delete her. This happened multiple times, with the fianc\u00e9 supposedly deleting her but then reconnecting. The author snoop-checked his phone and found likes on other family members. The fianc\u00e9 gave various excuses, and the author eventually left.\n\nNow, considering the evidence: The main issue is ongoing contact with an ex-girlfriend despite promises to cut it off. There's no mention of physical cheating, but emotional infidelity or boundary violations might be at play. The author felt betrayed because the fianc\u00e9 couldn't stop the contact, leading to a loss of trust. The repeated breaking of promises to delete the girl is a red flag. The author's decision to leave is based on the lack of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor commitments, even if there's no physical cheating. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat, but the emotional boundary issue is significant. The author has every right to be upset about the broken trust. In relationships, mutual respect and boundaries are crucial. If the fianc\u00e9 can't respect those, the author is justified in leaving. So the answer is B.\n"
