During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 of 7 years. They have a 6-year-old son together. The main issue seems to be that the fianc\u00e9 has been maintaining contact with a girl he's known for most of his life, despite the author asking him to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, the timeline here is important. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, he started talking to this girl. When they got back together, the author expected him to stop contact. He deleted her initially, but later she found out he was still interacting through social media. The author snooped and found evidence of likes and other interactions. The fianc\u00e9 kept re-adding her and the girl's sister, even after promises to block them.\n\nThe key points here are trust and repeated violations. The author felt betrayed by the continued contact, especially when there was a prior breakup and the girl's sister was also involved. The fianc\u00e9's actions were inconsistent with his promises, which likely eroded trust. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the ongoing contact and the need to repeatedly confront the issue could be seen as a breach of trust and emotional infidelity.\n\nThe author's decision to leave might be justified if the relationship had become toxic due to this ongoing issue. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept making promises and breaking them suggests a pattern that's hard to resolve. The author's actions in leaving could be seen as protecting her own emotional well-being and that of their child, even if the fianc\u00e9 didn't technically cheat. Emotional infidelity can be just as damaging as physical infidelity in a relationship.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's decision is hasty or that there wasn't concrete evidence of cheating. But given the repeated instances and the effort he put into re-adding the girl and her sister, it's more about pattern of behavior rather than a single incident. So, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
