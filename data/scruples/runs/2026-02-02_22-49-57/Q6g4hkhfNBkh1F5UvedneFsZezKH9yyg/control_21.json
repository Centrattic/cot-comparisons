During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement because their fianc\u00e9 is still in contact with an old friend, despite promises to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, the key points: The relationship has been ongoing for seven years with a child. There was a breakup, then back together. The author feels the fianc\u00e9 hasn't truly cut ties with the girl, even after multiple confrontations. The fianc\u00e9 deletes the girl, but then she reappears on social media. The author snooped through the phone and found likes on the girl's posts. The fianc\u00e9 gives excuses, like accidentally re-liking old posts. Now, the author ends things because they can't trust him, even without proof of cheating.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a trust perspective, in a relationship, especially one lasting so long, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to cut off contact, but kept re-engaging. The author's actions\u2014checking the phone\u2014might be seen as invasive, but given the context of repeated breaches of trust, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, even if not cheating, shows a pattern of not respecting boundaries. The author's decision to leave because of this lack of trust and repeated dishonesty seems justified. \n\nCheating isn't proven, but emotional infidelity can be just as damaging. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship's exclusivity. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the health of the relationship, especially with a child involved. Ending a long-term relationship over persistent dishonesty isn't necessarily the wrong choice. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
