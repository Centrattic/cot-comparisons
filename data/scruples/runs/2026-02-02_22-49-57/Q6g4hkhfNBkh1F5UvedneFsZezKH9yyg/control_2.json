During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 contacting another girl despite promises to cut contact. The author found evidence of continued contact, including liking photos even after previous agreements to delete the girl. There's also the part where he unblocked them recently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 7-year relationship with a child is significant. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not keeping his promises to cut off contact, which caused fights and led to the author feeling compelled to leave. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite not having proof of actual cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks promises about contact with an ex or other person, that can be a valid reason for leaving. The author's actions, like checking the phone, might be seen as an invasion of privacy, but given the context of prior issues, it's understandable as a last resort to confirm trust.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of dishonesty and lack of commitment to the relationship, which can be a legitimate reason for ending it. The author isn't at fault for seeking a relationship where mutual respect and exclusivity are maintained. The decision to leave is based on the inability to resolve the recurring issue, which indicates a breakdown in the relationship's foundation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
