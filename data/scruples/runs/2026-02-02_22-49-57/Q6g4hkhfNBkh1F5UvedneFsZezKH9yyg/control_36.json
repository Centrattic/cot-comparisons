During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl, the author's actions like snooping, and whether the author made the right decision.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been long-term with a child together. That adds a layer of complexity, especially since they're engaged. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not cutting off contact with the other girl despite promises. The author found evidence through snooping, which might be a point of debate\u2014was that justified? Then, there were multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on deleting the girl, even going so far as to unblock her after supposedly blocking. The author left because of this pattern, even without proof of cheating.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspect: trust is a big factor in relationships. The fianc\u00e9's actions (continuing contact despite promises) might be seen as a breach of trust. The author's snooping could be seen as a breach of privacy, but the motivation was due to concerns about infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's behavior suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship, which is a valid reason to end it. However, the author's method of checking the phone might be questionable. But given the context of repeated issues, maybe it's understandable. The author's decision to leave is based on not being able to trust the fianc\u00e9 anymore. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not, because the fianc\u00e9's actions were the primary issue. The author acted on their feelings of betrayal and lack of trust. The answer should be B (No).\n"
