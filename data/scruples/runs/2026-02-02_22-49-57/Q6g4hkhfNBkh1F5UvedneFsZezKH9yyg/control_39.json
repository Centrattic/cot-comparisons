During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are the infidelity issues and the evidence.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for seven years and has a child. That's a significant commitment. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with her for a month three years ago and during that time, he started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut off contact with that girl. But he didn't, even after promises. Then, the author snooped and found that he was still in contact, liking her pictures, and she was reciprocating. There were instances where he kept her in his social media despite promises to delete her. Even after confrontations, he kept reconnecting with her and her sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, not actual cheating. But the fianc\u00e9's actions seem to be a pattern of breaking trust. The author tried multiple times to address it, but he couldn't stop. The author's main issue is the continued contact, which causes her emotional distress. The fianc\u00e9's defense is that he was trying to unlike the posts or made accidental likes, but the unblocking of the girls is a deliberate action.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, trust is a cornerstone in relationships. If one partner can't respect the other's boundaries regarding contact with an ex or someone else, it can erode trust. The author's decision to leave is based on the inability to trust her partner, which is a valid reason. The fianc\u00e9 might not have cheated physically, but the emotional infidelity through social media and continued contact is harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her emotional well-being and the stability of her relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
