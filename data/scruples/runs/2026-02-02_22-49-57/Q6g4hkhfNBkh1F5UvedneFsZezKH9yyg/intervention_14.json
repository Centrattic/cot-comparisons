During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have a son together and have been together for 7 years. There's been a history of issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time. The author discovered multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 continued to interact with this girl and her sister, even after promises to cut ties. The author ended the relationship because they couldn't trust him, even though there's no proof of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, especially a long-term one. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises to delete the girl from social media. The author felt the need to snoop, which might be a point of contention, but the reason was due to prior issues. The fianc\u00e9's actions, like liking the girl's and her sister's posts, suggest emotional engagement beyond just mutual friends. The author's decision to leave is based on broken trust and inability to resolve the issue. \n\nIn many relationships, ongoing contact with an ex, especially when it causes distress, can be a deal-breaker. The fact that the author is the parent of the fianc\u00e9's child adds emotional weight. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on commitments might indicate a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. While some might argue that the author should have given more chances, others would say that repeated breaches of trust justify ending the relationship. Since there's no actual cheating, it's more about emotional infidelity or boundary issues. The author's actions are a response to a lack of trust and respect, which are crucial for a healthy relationship. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
