During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting off contact with an ex-girlfriend, despite multiple promises. The key points here are the repeated breaches of trust over a long period, even after the author confronted him multiple times and he made promises to change his behavior.\n\nFirst, the author discovered that the fianc\u00e9 was still in contact with the girl even after he claimed to have deleted her. Then there was the incident with liking the girl's sister's posts, which the fianc\u00e9 tried to explain away. Most recently, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister, which shows a pattern of not following through on commitments.\n\nThe user is leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, and I need to assess if the answer is A or B. The main factors are whether the author had just cause to end the relationship. The repeated issues with trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to cut ties, even after multiple chances, suggest that the author has valid reasons to leave. There's no evidence of cheating, but the consistent behavior of not respecting boundaries could be enough for the author to feel it's necessary to end the relationship for their own peace of mind and the well-being of their family.\n\nSo, considering the pattern of behavior and the author's right to set boundaries, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The key here is that the author acted to protect their emotional health and the integrity of the relationship, given the repeated failures of the fianc\u00e9 to meet agreed-upon boundaries.\n"
