During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering breaking off because their fianc\u00e9 keeps in contact with another girl. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple broke up once before, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 talked to this girl. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut contact. He did delete her initially, but then later, the author found out he was still interacting online. There were multiple instances where the author found he had liked her pictures, and even after promises to stop, it happened again. The latest is unblocking them. The author left because of this, even though there's no direct evidence of cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is a big component. If the author felt that the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with the other girl was a breach of trust, even without physical infidelity, that's a valid concern. People in relationships often have boundaries about contact with exes or close friends. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking the agreed-upon boundary despite promises, which could justify the author's decision to end things. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. But given the context of repeated breaches of trust, that might be understandable. Also, the fianc\u00e9's actions (like unblocking after promising not to) show a pattern of disrespecting the author's feelings. \n\nThe main issue here is whether maintaining contact with an ex or close friend crosses a line in a committed relationship. Many people would say that if both partners agree on boundaries, and one party repeatedly breaks them despite the other's discomfort, that's a serious issue. The author has tried multiple times to resolve it, but the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through. \n\nWithout evidence of cheating, it's possible some might argue the author overreacted. But given the long-term nature of the relationship and the cumulative effect of these actions, it's reasonable for the author to feel that trust has been irreparably damaged. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted based on their trust being violated and the fianc\u00e9's failure to meet agreed boundaries.\n"
