During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 continued to have contact with another girl, despite promises to cut off contact. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been together seven years and has a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to stop contact. They fought about it, and he eventually deleted her from social media. But later, the author snooped and found he was still in contact, liking her pictures and the sister's. Each time he promised to delete her but failed, leading the author to eventually leave.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship based on ongoing contact with another person, even without proof of cheating. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider if the author had valid reasons. The repeated breaking of promises to cut off contact, combined with the fianc\u00e9's defensive and angry reactions, suggests a lack of trust and respect. The author's actions in checking the phone might be seen as snooping, but given the context, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not honoring agreements, which can erode trust in a relationship. Even without cheating, consistent dishonesty and emotional attachment to another person can justify leaving, especially when attempts to resolve it have failed.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like seeking couples counseling before leaving. But given the repeated incidents and the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to change, the author's decision to prioritize their well-being and their child's stability could be justified. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to a partner who couldn't meet their expectations for fidelity and transparency. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted to preserve their own emotional health and the relationship's integrity after multiple failures to address the issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
