During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves a lot of ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off. The author found evidence of likes on social media, blocked accounts, and finally the fianc\u00e9 unblocking them again. They decided to end the relationship because they can't trust him anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not following through on promises to delete the other girl. The author had to snoop because of the lack of transparency. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not physical cheating, might be emotional infidelity or breaches of trust. The author's decision to leave is based on these repeated violations and the inability to trust. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not respecting boundaries. Even if he claims he didn't intend to like the pictures, the repeated actions (blocking and then unblocking) suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship's exclusivity. The author's trust is broken, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner consistently breaches that trust, even without physical infidelity, the other partner has the right to leave. The author isn't at fault here because they acted based on the fianc\u00e9's actions and the lack of resolution despite multiple chances given. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author made a difficult decision to protect their own well-being and their child's future, based on the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect the relationship's boundaries.\n"
