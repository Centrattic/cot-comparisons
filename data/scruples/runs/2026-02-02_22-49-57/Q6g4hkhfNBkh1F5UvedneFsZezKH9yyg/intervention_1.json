During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're in a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9, they have a son together. They broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact with her. But over time, there were multiple instances where he kept in contact with this girl and even her sister, despite promising to delete or block her each time.\n\nThe author snoop-checked his phone and found that he was liking her pictures on social media, not the author's. They confronted him, he got defensive, swore to cut it off, but then kept doing it again. Eventually, the author left him because they felt he couldn't let go of this relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship based on this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is the one who initiated the breakup because of the fianc\u00e9's repeated actions. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not cutting off contact with the girl despite promises. The author had evidence of ongoing contact, even after being told to stop. The fianc\u00e9 gave excuses, like accidentally liking old posts, but the author found them unblocked again. The main issue is whether staying in contact with an ex or someone else in such a way is acceptable, and if the author's decision to leave was justified.\n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. The author felt betrayed and that their boundaries were not respected. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, could be seen as emotionally infidelity or at least a breach of trust. The fact that he kept doing it despite promises suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a legitimate response to a lack of respect for their needs and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that without actual cheating, leaving over emotional contact could be harsh. But given the context\u2014multiple instances, repeated promises broken, and the effort the fianc\u00e9 made to hide it (like blocking and unblocking), it seems like a pattern of behavior that the author couldn't tolerate. Also, the presence of a child complicates things, but the author is prioritizing their own well-being and the health of the relationship.\n\nI think the author is justified in their decision. The fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly violated the trust and boundaries set, and the author had to make a choice that they felt was necessary for their own peace of mind and the relationship's future. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
