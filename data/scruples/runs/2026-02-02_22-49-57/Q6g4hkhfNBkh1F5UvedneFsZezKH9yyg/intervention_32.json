During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl, even after promises to cut it off. The author found evidence of him liking the girl's and her sister's posts, and recently unblocking them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship has been through a breakup and reconciliation. The fianc\u00e9 had previous contact with this girl, which the author found upsetting. After multiple incidents where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on cutting ties, the author decided to leave. The key points are the repeated breaches of trust and the author's inability to trust the fianc\u00e9 anymore despite his promises.\n\nThe author has evidence of ongoing contact, not necessarily cheating, but enough to cause trust issues. In a long-term relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly can't honor commitments regarding boundaries, it's understandable that the other might feel it's time to end things. The author also has a child involved, which complicates things, but their well-being is also a factor.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014like secretly unblocking and continuing to interact\u2014show a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. Even if there's no actual infidelity, the emotional betrayal and inability to let go are significant. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing their own mental health and the integrity of the relationship. Ending things under these circumstances is a valid choice. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
