During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering leaving because their fianc\u00e9 keeps in contact with another girl despite promises to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple broke up for a month, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut all contact. He did delete her initially but later kept reconnecting, even after multiple confrontations. The author found out through snooping that he was still in contact, liked her photos, and even had her sister's posts. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to delete her but kept re-adding them. Finally, the author ends the relationship because they can't trust him anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants a second opinion. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, trust and boundaries in a relationship are crucial. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises to cut contact, which the author found out through snooping. The author's decision to leave is based on betrayal of trust and inability to move past the issue. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity or the perception of it can be a deal-breaker. The author had a right to feel hurt and betrayed, especially since the fianc\u00e9 kept lying and re-establishing contact despite knowing it was a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't cheating, just maintaining a friendship. But the fact that he kept re-adding the girl and her sister, and the author has to snoop to find out each time suggests a pattern of dishonesty. The author's actions (snooping) could be seen as invasive, but given the context of repeated violations, it's a reasonable step to check. \n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner can't respect the boundaries set by the other, especially after multiple chances, the relationship's future is in question. The author's decision to leave is a personal choice, and the fianc\u00e9's actions likely contributed significantly to that decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n"
