During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a 7-year engagement with her partner, has a son together, and they broke up briefly for a month three years ago. During that time, the partner started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact with this girl. He deleted her from social media initially but later, the author found out he was still in contact. She snooped and found he was liking the girl's pictures while ignoring her own. After multiple confrontations and promises to delete her, the partner ended up unblocking the girl and her sister again. The author then decides to leave him.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for ending the engagement? The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, which is answer B.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue revolves around trust and boundaries in the relationship. The author feels betrayed because her partner keeps violating her trust by maintaining contact with an ex or someone else. Even though there's no evidence of cheating, the ongoing contact is a breach of trust, which is significant in a committed relationship. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, trust is fundamental. If one partner repeatedly breaks the trust by not respecting the other's boundaries, it can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The author has given multiple chances\u2014each time the partner promised to delete the girl, but it kept happening. This pattern suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship or an inability to respect the other's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that without actual proof of cheating, the author is overreacting. However, the key here is that the partner is maintaining contact despite promises to cut it off. This isn't just about cheating but about respecting the boundaries set by the partner. The fact that the author had to snoop multiple times indicates that the partner wasn't transparent, which adds to the breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their son. The author is ending the engagement, which might affect their child. However, being in a relationship where trust is consistently broken can also be harmful to the child in the long run. A healthy relationship is beneficial for the child, and if the relationship is toxic or untrustworthy, ending it might be the better choice.\n\nThe partner's actions\u2014repeatedly breaking promises, unblocking the girl and her sister after being asked not to\u2014show a pattern of behavior that the author can't trust. Trust is essential in a marriage or engagement, and if it's continually broken, it's reasonable for the author to walk away.\n\nSome might say the author violated the partner's privacy by snooping, but given the context of the repeated issues, her actions could be seen as a last resort to confirm her suspicions. Privacy is important, but when trust is already compromised and there's a pattern of deceit, it's a complicated situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to leave is based on a breach of trust and repeated broken promises, which are significant enough to justify ending the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
