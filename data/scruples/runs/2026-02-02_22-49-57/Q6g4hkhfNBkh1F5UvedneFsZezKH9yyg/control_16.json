During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering leaving because their fianc\u00e9 keeps contacting an ex-friend. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, they had a breakup a few years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 talked to this girl. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut contact. But he didn't delete her from social media initially, leading to fights. Then, after some time, the author snooped and found he was still connected, liking her pictures. He swore to delete her, but she came back. The author left temporarily, but after talking, he promised again. Then, he accidentally liked the sister's posts, which he tried to fix but messed up. Now, he's unblocked them again.\n\nThe key here is the pattern. The fianc\u00e9 keeps breaking promises to cut contact. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, not just once but multiple times. They even had to snoop to find out each time. The question is whether this is enough to justify ending the relationship. Cheating isn't mentioned, but emotional infidelity or broken trust could be a reason. The author is the parent of the couple's child, so the stability of the relationship affects the child too.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, trust is repeatedly broken, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest he can't commit to ending the contact, despite promises. The author might feel that without trust, the relationship is unsustainable. On the other hand, some might argue that without proof of cheating, it's a misunderstanding or a miscommunication. But the pattern here isn't just one incident; it's repeated and intentional after each confrontation.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is justified in feeling wronged and deciding to leave. The fianc\u00e9's actions have shown a lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries, which is a valid reason to end it, especially given the long-term impact on their child. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
