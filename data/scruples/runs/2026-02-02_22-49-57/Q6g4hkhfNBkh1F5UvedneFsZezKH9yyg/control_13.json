During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after a 7-year relationship. The main issue seems to be about their fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that they found their fianc\u00e9 still following or liking posts of this girl and her sister on social media multiple times. The first time they broke up for a month, then the fianc\u00e9 deleted the girl from social media but then later kept her blocked. The user checked again and found he had reconnected. There's also mention of liking the girl's sister's posts, which they claim was accidental. Finally, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe user is asking if they did the right thing by leaving, given that there's no evidence of actual cheating, just ongoing contact. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified. The fianc\u00e9 has made promises to cut off contact but hasn't followed through multiple times. The user tried to resolve the issue through confrontation and communication, but it kept recurring.\n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. If one partner consistently violates the other's trust by not respecting agreed boundaries, even if it's not cheating, it can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The user has a right to feel betrayed and not respected. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of dishonesty and breaking commitments, which can erode trust over time.\n\nIt's also important to consider the impact on the child. The user is not just ending a romantic relationship but also co-parenting with someone they no longer trust. Maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship is challenging if there's unresolved tension and broken promises.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the user snoop through the phone, which could be seen as invasive. However, given the context of repeated issues and the fianc\u00e9's defensive reactions, the snooping might be a response to his lack of transparency. The fianc\u00e9's actions in hiding the contact and lying about it could justify the user's need to check.\n\nSince there's no evidence of physical or emotional abuse, but there is a pattern of emotional unfaithfulness through maintaining contact and not respecting boundaries, the user's decision to leave is based on protecting their own well-being and their son's. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a lack of commitment to repairing the relationship, so the user is not in the wrong for ending it.\n"
