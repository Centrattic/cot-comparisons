During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with an ex-girlfriend despite multiple promises to cut it off. The author found evidence of ongoing interactions, including liking photos and unblocking them after previously agreeing to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 7-year relationship is long-term, and having a child together adds emotional weight. The fianc\u00e9 had a month-long breakup, during which he started talking to this girl. When they reunited, the author reasonably expected him to end contact. However, he didn't. There were multiple instances where he failed to delete her from social media, even after promises. The author snooped because of the lack of trust, which is understandable given the situation.\n\nThe key points here are betrayal of trust, broken promises, and the author feeling that their concerns aren't being respected. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship, even if there's no actual cheating. The author's decision to leave might stem from feeling that their partner isn't trustworthy or willing to address the issue, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped, which can be a point of contention. However, in this case, the snooping was a result of his continued dishonesty. The fianc\u00e9's inability or unwillingness to cut off all contact with someone he's known for a long time might indicate deeper issues, like unresolved feelings or lack of boundaries, which can erode trust over time.\n\nThe author isn't at fault for wanting to end the relationship when trust can't be maintained. The fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly violated the author's trust, and the author prioritized their own well-being and their son's stability by leaving. So, the answer is B.\n"
