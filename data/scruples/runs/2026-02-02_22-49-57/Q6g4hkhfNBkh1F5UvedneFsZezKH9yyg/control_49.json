During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. They have a child together, and the main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another girl, despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for seven years with a six-year-old son. They broke up briefly three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 talked to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to stop contact, which he initially did. But then later, the author found out he was still in contact, even liking her social media posts. There were confrontations, promises to delete her, but it kept happening. The author snooped because they felt things were distant. The fianc\u00e9 had liked the girl's sister's posts, and then recently unblocked both the girl and her sister. The author left him because he couldn't cut off contact, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, when is someone in the wrong for ending a relationship? Trust is crucial in relationships. The author felt betrayed because the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to stop contact with the other girl. Even if there's no actual cheating, maintaining contact when it's causing emotional distress could be seen as a breach of trust. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue through communication, and each time the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. The author had evidence of the ongoing contact, which is a red flag. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 had to unblock them intentionally suggests he was trying to reconnect, which the author found unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which is an invasion of privacy. However, given the context of previous issues and the fianc\u00e9's secretive behavior (like blocking and unblocking to hide activity), the author's actions might be seen as a last resort to protect her own emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship. The key here is whether the author had reasonable grounds to be concerned. Since there's a pattern of behavior that shows the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting her boundaries, even if it's not cheating, it's a significant issue in a committed relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect for boundaries are essential. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's boundaries, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author isn't claiming cheating, but the ongoing contact could be a form of emotional infidelity, depending on how both parties view the relationship. Emotional infidelity can be just as damaging as physical cheating in some contexts.\n\nTherefore, considering the repeated breaches of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor his promises, the author's decision to leave might be justified. The wrong here would be on the fianc\u00e9 for not respecting her boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship under these circumstances. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
