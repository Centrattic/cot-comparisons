During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong when leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 has maintained contact with another girl, despite previous agreements to cut off contact. The author discovered this through snooping, which might be a point of contention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The couple has been together for a long time and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not cutting off contact with another girl, even after promises. This has happened multiple times, leading to confrontations each time. The author's actions included checking the phone, which some might see as invasive, but others might understand as a response to prior deceit.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is justified in leaving due to ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9's communication with another person. The fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat, but there's a pattern of not respecting boundaries. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on lack of trust and broken promises, which are significant in a long-term commitment.\n\nNow, considering cultural and social norms, maintaining boundaries in a relationship is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates those boundaries despite assurances, it can erode trust. The author's actions might be seen as self-preservation, especially given the history. However, the method of checking the phone could be a gray area, but the outcome\u2014trying to protect the relationship and their child\u2014might justify it.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author didn't give enough chances or that the fianc\u00e9 didn't actually have an affair. But the pattern of behavior here is about persistent contact despite agreements, which can be a sign of deeper issues like emotional infidelity or inability to commit fully. The author might feel that continuing the relationship would lead to further pain and instability, especially for their child.\n\nI should also think about the legal and emotional aspects. Since they're engaged and have a child, the decision to leave has implications beyond just their relationship. But the right to leave a relationship where trust is broken is generally respected. So, the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice based on the circumstances provided.\n"
