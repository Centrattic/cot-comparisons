During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" story) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a 6-year-old son together. The key issue is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with a girl he's known for most of his life, which the author found problematic and eventually led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline and the author's reasoning. The couple broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut all contact. He did delete her initially but later resumed contact, which the author discovered through snooping. The author found that he liked her photos on social media, and even the girl's sister. Each time the author confronted him, he promised to delete her, but the contact kept resurfacing. The final trigger was him unblocking the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving because the fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat but kept in touch with another girl. The user wants to know if the author's decision is justified.\n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't respecting the boundaries set for their relationship. While there's no evidence of physical infidelity, the ongoing emotional contact and favoring another person's social media presence could be seen as a breach of trust. The author tried multiple times to address the issue, and each time the fianc\u00e9 broke his promises. Repeated broken promises can erode trust and make the relationship unsustainable for the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't intend to keep in touch and made mistakes, like accidentally liking the sister's photos. However, the fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again shows intentional action, which the author perceived as a betrayal of their agreed boundaries.\n\nThe author's decision to leave is based on their own emotional well-being and the lack of respect for the relationship's boundaries. Since the fianc\u00e9 couldn't meet their expectations despite multiple chances, the author is within their rights to end the relationship. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own needs and the health of their relationship with their son, even if there's no actual cheating involved. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
