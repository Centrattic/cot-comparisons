During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is in a 7-year engagement with a partner they have a son with. About 3 years ago, they broke up for a month, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reunited, and the author expected him to cut all contact with that girl. When they reunited, he initially deleted her from social media, but the author found out later he hadn't. The author snooped and found evidence that he was still in contact, liking her pictures, etc., and confrontations followed. He promised to delete her again but didn't. The author then left him, but he came back. Recently, the author found that he had unblocked the girl and her sister again. The author is considering ending the relationship because of this, even though there's no proof of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the author is thinking they're not, but they want an outside opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The relationship has been ongoing for seven years, and there's a child involved. The fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly failed to cut off contact with another woman despite promises. The author has tried to address this through communication, but it hasn't resolved. The ongoing contact includes liking photos, not blocking on social media, and even unblocking after promises to stop. The author's actions included snooping, which might be a point of contention.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is consistently not respecting the other's boundaries, that can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not following through on commitments, which can erode trust. The author's decision to leave is based on the lack of trust and repeated failures to address the issue. However, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating, just maintaining a friendship, which complicates the situation.\n\nBut the author's concern is understandable. Even if there's no actual infidelity, the continued contact and the fianc\u00e9's inability to stop it could be seen as a breach of trust. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the relationship's health by walking away when trust can't be restored.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially since there's no proof of cheating. The act of snooping could be seen as invasive, and maybe the author should have given more chances or communicated differently. But given the repeated nature of the issue and the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty about deleting the contact, the author's actions might be justified.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The repeated breaches of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor commitments are significant issues that justify ending the relationship, especially in a long-term engagement where trust is foundational.\n"
