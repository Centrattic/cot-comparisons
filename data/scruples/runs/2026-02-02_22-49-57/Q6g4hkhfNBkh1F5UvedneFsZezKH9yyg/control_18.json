During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a son together, which adds another layer since it's not just a relationship breaking up but also a co-parenting situation.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The couple broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut all contact with her. He deleted her from social media, but later it turned out he hadn't. The author found out through snooping, which might be a point of contention. Then, he liked the girl's sister's pictures, claimed it was an accident. Finally, he unblocked both the girl and her sister, leading the author to end the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the fianc\u00e9's behavior regarding contact with another woman. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, but not actual cheating. The fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly promised to cut ties but failed. The author took matters into their own hands by snooping, which might be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the fianc\u00e9 was also being deceptive about deleting contacts, maybe the author had reason to check again. \n\nThe fact that the author checked the phone again after previous promises not to. Snooping in a relationship is generally considered a breach of privacy, but if one partner is being deceptive, it might be understandable. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continuing to follow and like the other girl and her sister's posts, even after agreements to delete them\u2014suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author felt betrayed and unable to trust him anymore, so they left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The author's snooping might not be justified, but the fianc\u00e9's repeated violations of established boundaries could be more significant. The author had a valid reason to feel insecure and maybe the trust was broken. Since there's no actual cheating mentioned, maybe some would argue the author is overreacting. But others might see the ongoing contact as a red flag, especially if it's causing tension and distrust. \n\nIf the author left because they couldn't trust their partner despite his repeated failures to keep promises, that's a personal decision. The question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the fianc\u00e9 was indeed still in contact and not honest about it, the author's decision might be seen as justified. But the act of snooping could be a point against them. However, given the circumstances, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), because the author's actions were a response to the fianc\u00e9's breaches of trust and boundaries, even if they resorted to snooping. The fianc\u00e9's behavior seems more problematic here.\n"
