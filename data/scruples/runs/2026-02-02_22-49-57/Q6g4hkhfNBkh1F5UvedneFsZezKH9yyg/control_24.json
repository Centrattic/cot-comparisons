During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement with the father of her child. The key points here are the ongoing issues with her fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off, and the author ending the relationship due to this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They've been engaged for 7 years and have a child together, which adds emotional weight. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another woman. The author has found evidence multiple times\u2014like liking her pictures, not blocking her, and even unblocking her sister again. The fianc\u00e9's explanations seem inconsistent (e.g., liking the sister's posts accidentally) and he keeps breaking promises to cut ties. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's decision is justified. In relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's behavior repeatedly breaches her trust, even if there's no actual infidelity. The fact that he can't follow through on his promises might indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author's decision to leave is a response to these ongoing issues, not just a single incident. \n\nHowever, some might argue that without proof of cheating, maybe she's overreacting. But given the repeated patterns and the emotional toll, her decision is understandable. The child's well-being is also a factor, but the question focuses on whether she's in the wrong for ending the engagement, not the child custody aspect. \n\nSo, considering the repeated breaches of trust, the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect her boundaries, and the emotional impact, the author's decision seems justified. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
