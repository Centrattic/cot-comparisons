During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years, given the circumstances described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have a 7-year-old son together. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he knew for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact with her. He deleted her initially but later reconnected, even liking her and her sister's posts on social media. The author discovered this through snooping, which might be a point to consider. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly promised to delete her but didn't, and the author left him. Now they're questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nThe main issue here is betrayal of trust. The fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on his promises to cut contact, which the author found unacceptable. The author has evidence of continued contact and the fianc\u00e9's inability to commit to cutting it off. The question is whether this justifies leaving the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's actions are a personal choice based on the trust being broken. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, even if not cheating, shows a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. The author might feel that the relationship can't continue without that trust. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that decision. The answer could be B, but I need to make sure there's no other angle. For example, snooping could be seen as an invasion of privacy, but the context is that the author felt justified due to the repeated breaches. The fianc\u00e9's actions clearly violated the agreed boundaries, so the author's decision is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
