During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation is complicated. The main points are that the fianc\u00e9 had a long-term relationship, a child, and there were multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 kept contact with an ex-girlfriend despite promises to cut off contact. The author found out through snooping that he was still interacting with her on social media, liking her posts, and even having them unblocked again recently.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements here. The author is in a committed relationship with someone they've been engaged to for seven years, and they have a child together. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not following through on commitments to end contact with this girl. The author has tried multiple times to address the issue, leading to arguments and temporary separations. The evidence presented is that the fianc\u00e9 continued to interact with the girl and her sister, even after agreeing to stop. The author finally decides to leave because they feel betrayed and can't trust their partner anymore.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014maintaining contact despite promises, not being transparent, and continuing to interact even after being confronted\u2014are significant. The author's decision to leave is based on a lack of trust and feeling that the relationship isn't safe or respectful. While snooping isn't ideal, the author's actions stemmed from concern and a desire to protect the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's pattern of behavior over time, not just a single incident, contributed to the breakdown. The key here is that the author felt they couldn't trust their partner, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions were inconsistent with the expectations of a monogamous, committed relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to honor his commitments are the main issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
