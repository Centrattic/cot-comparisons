During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he continues to have contact with another girl. The key points here are the ongoing issue with maintaining contact despite promises to cut it off, the discovery of likes on social media, and the recent unblocking of the girl and her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 had a month-long breakup with his partner and during that time, started talking to someone he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact, which is a reasonable request. However, he continued to interact, even after multiple confrontations and promises to stop.\n\nThe author snooped through his phone and found evidence of ongoing likes and interactions. The fianc\u00e9's defensive reactions and failure to follow through on his promises might be a red flag. The repeated pattern of not honoring commitments could lead to a loss of trust. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the persistent contact might be seen as emotionally inappropriate and a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's decision to leave is based on these breaches and the inability to resolve the issue. The question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if one partner can't respect the other's boundaries regarding contact with someone else, the trust in the relationship is damaged. The author likely felt that the relationship couldn't continue under these conditions, which is a valid reason for ending it. The fianc\u00e9's actions, especially the recent unblocking, show a lack of commitment to fixing the problem.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She acted based on broken trust and unmet promises, which are significant in a long-term relationship.\n"
