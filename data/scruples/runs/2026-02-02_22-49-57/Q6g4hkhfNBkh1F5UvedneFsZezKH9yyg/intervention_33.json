During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9. The main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with an ex-girlfriend he's known for most of his life. The author discovered this contact multiple times, even after the fianc\u00e9 promised to cut it off. The key points here are the repeated breaches of trust and the author's decision to leave based on those actions.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 and the girl were in contact during a previous breakup, and after getting back together, the author expected him to stop. But even after deleting her, he continued liking her posts, hiding it by blocking the author. Then there's the incident with the girl's sister, and finally, unblocking both. The author has evidence of these actions, even if it's not cheating per se. But the pattern here is consistent: the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting boundaries set by the author, which is causing the author to lose trust and feel hurt.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks the other's trust, especially by hiding things and not following through on promises, that can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The author isn't accusing him of cheating but of emotional infidelity or at least emotional unavailability. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them suggests that he's not taking the author's feelings seriously, which is a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, given the context of the relationship and the prior incidents, the author might have felt it was necessary for their own peace of mind. The fianc\u00e9's actions led to the author checking his phone multiple times, so it's a cycle of mistrust.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is justified in leaving because of these actions. Since the fianc\u00e9's behavior is ongoing and not respecting the boundaries, the author is acting to protect themselves from further hurt. In such cases, ending the relationship isn't about being \"in the wrong\" but about self-respect and the health of the relationship. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
