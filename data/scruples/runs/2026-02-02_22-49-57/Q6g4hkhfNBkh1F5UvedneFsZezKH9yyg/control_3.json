During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The key factors here are the evidence of the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off, and the author's decision to leave due to that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. There was a breakup a few years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he'd known for a long time. After they reunited, the author expected him to end all contact with her, which he initially did but then continued in secret. The author discovered this multiple times, each time leading to arguments and promises from him to delete the girl, but it kept happening. The latest incident was the girl and her sister being unblocked again.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nNow, considering the ethical and moral aspects, trust is a cornerstone in any relationship, especially a long-term one. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises to cut off contact with another woman, showing a pattern of dishonesty and lack of commitment to the relationship. The author has evidence of this continued contact, even after confrontations. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again suggests deliberate deception. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the lack of trust and repeated betrayals would make the relationship unsustainable. Ending the relationship under these circumstances could be seen as justified, as staying might mean enduring ongoing emotional pain and insecurity. The author is prioritizing her well-being and that of their son, ensuring a stable environment. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that there's no evidence of actual cheating, just contact. However, the pattern of behavior\u2014repeatedly breaking promises, hiding contact, and the emotional impact on the author\u2014are significant. The author's decision is based on the erosion of trust over time, which is a legitimate reason for ending a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
