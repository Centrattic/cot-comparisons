During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known for years, despite the author's requests to cut it off. There have been multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 either didn't delete the contact or reconnected, leading to the author eventually deciding to end the relationship. The key points are that there's no evidence of cheating, just continued contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The couple has a child and a seven-year history. The author feels betrayed because the fianc\u00e9 can't stop contacting this other girl. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might be defensive and not see the issue as severe enough to end the relationship. The author's actions, like snooping through the phone, might be seen as overstepping, but it's in the context of trying to protect the relationship and their child's father's presence.\n\nThe main issue here is trust. The author has repeatedly asked for the contact to be severed, which is a reasonable request in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9's inability or unwillingness to comply, even after multiple promises, suggests a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock them again might indicate a pattern of dishonesty or at least a disregard for the author's feelings.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Ending a seven-year relationship is a major decision, but if there's a consistent breach of trust and boundaries without resolution, it's understandable. The author might feel that their emotional needs aren't being met and that the relationship isn't safe. Since there's no actual cheating, some might argue that the author is overreacting, but the repeated breaches of trust could justify leaving. The presence of a child might also influence the decision, but the author is still within their right to prioritize their well-being and the relationship's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might claim he's not cheating, just maintaining a friendship, which isn't necessarily wrong. However, in a committed relationship, the expectation is usually mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the author clearly communicated that this contact was a deal-breaker and the fianc\u00e9 couldn't honor that, the author has valid reasons to leave.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting based on the fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to respect their boundaries, which are crucial in a relationship. The key here is the ongoing pattern and the lack of resolution despite multiple chances. The answer should be B for No.\n"
