During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with an ex-girlfriend, which the author found out through snooping. \n\nFirst, the timeline is important. The couple broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut contact. He deleted her initially, but later she reappeared in his social media, even after confrontations. The author found him liking her posts and even the sister's, leading to the final breaking point.\n\nNow, the key points here are trust and boundaries. The author feels that the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting the boundaries set in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might argue that he's not cheating, just keeping contact. But the problem is the emotional infidelity aspect. Even without physical cheating, maintaining a close relationship with an ex can be a deal-breaker for many people. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014snooping through the phone\u2014could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, considering the context of ongoing issues and the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty about deleting the ex, the author might feel justified. The repeated lying and not following through on promises to cut contact could erode trust significantly.\n\nAlso, the author is the parent of their child, so this isn't just about their relationship but also about stability for their son. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be creating a stressful environment for the family. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about mutual respect and understanding. The author made their boundaries clear, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't honor them despite multiple chances. The decision to leave might be a result of feeling disrespected and untrusted. While the author did snoop, which isn't ideal, the fianc\u00e9's persistent behavior could justify the decision. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly violated the agreed-upon boundaries, leading to a loss of trust and respect.\n"
