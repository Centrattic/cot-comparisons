During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person in the WIBTA scenario) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another girl, even after multiple promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, the relationship has a long history, seven years, with a child together. That's a significant commitment. The breakup was after a month three years ago, but they reconciled. The author wanted the fianc\u00e9 to stop all contact with the girl, which he did temporarily but then continued in different ways. The author found evidence of him liking the girl's photos, blocking/unblocking her, and even liking her sister's posts. Each time, the fianc\u00e9 gave explanations, like trying to unlike posts accidentally, but the pattern repeats.\n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't respecting the boundaries set in the relationship. Even without cheating, the ongoing contact and the fianc\u00e9's inability to fully cut ties might be causing emotional harm. The author's decision to leave is based on the fact that the fianc\u00e9 keeps breaking his promises, leading to a loss of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that there's no actual infidelity, just contact. Maybe he believes it's not a big deal, or he's trying but not succeeding. However, the repeated actions despite promises could be seen as a lack of respect for the partner's feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner can't honor their commitments regarding contact with someone else, especially after multiple instances, it's reasonable for the other partner to feel betrayed. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the health of the relationship by leaving when trust can't be maintained.\n\nSo, considering the pattern of behavior and the breach of trust, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even without cheating, have caused repeated harm. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
