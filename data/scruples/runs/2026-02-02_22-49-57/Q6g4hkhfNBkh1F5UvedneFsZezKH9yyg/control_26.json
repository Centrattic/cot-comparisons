During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with her fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time, even after promises to cut ties. The author found evidence of him liking her social media posts, not hers, and even unblocking them after supposedly deleting them. The key here is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship based on the evidence of ongoing contact, which isn't necessarily cheating but is causing a lot of conflict and distrust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has a child together, which adds emotional and practical complexity. The fianc\u00e9 has broken multiple promises to cut ties with this girl, leading to repeated conflicts. The author has done something many people find difficult: checking his phone, which is a privacy issue, but she did so out of suspicion and concern. The evidence she found\u2014liking the girl's photos, not hers, and unblocking them\u2014suggests a pattern of behavior that she perceives as a lack of commitment and transparency.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are betrayal, broken trust, and the impact on the relationship. While there's no mention of actual physical infidelity, the emotional infidelity and the repeated failures to honor commitments to cut contact could be seen as a breach of trust. The author feels that her partner is emotionally unavailable or not prioritizing their relationship, which is a valid reason for someone to end a relationship, especially when it's been a recurring issue over several years.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that staying in contact with a friend, even if it's causing tension, isn't necessarily wrong if there's no cheating involved. However, the author's perspective is that this contact is a deal-breaker for her, and she's made that clear. In relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's boundaries. If he can't respect her boundary of cutting contact, then the relationship might not be sustainable for her.\n\nAnother angle is the fact that the author took the initiative to snoop, which could be seen as a violation of privacy. However, her actions were motivated by the prior incidents and her feeling of being disrespected. The fianc\u00e9's actions in hiding the contact (blocking the author to prevent her from seeing interactions) also suggest a lack of honesty.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and relationship ethics, trust and communication are paramount. The fianc\u00e9's inability or unwillingness to fully cut ties, despite multiple promises, indicates a fundamental issue that the author can't reconcile. Given the repeated breaches and the emotional toll, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize her well-being and that of her son by ending the relationship if she feels it's the only way to move forward.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a difficult decision based on a pattern of behavior that undermines the trust and commitment needed in a long-term partnership, especially with a child involved. Her actions, while painful, are a response to ongoing issues that he hasn't resolved, and she's choosing to walk away to protect herself and her son from further emotional harm.\n"
