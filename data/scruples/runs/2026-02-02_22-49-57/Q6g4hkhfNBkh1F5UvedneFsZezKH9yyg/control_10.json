During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is a 7-year engagement where the fianc\u00e9 has been contacting a girl he's known for a long time. The author found out about this contact multiple times, even after the fianc\u00e9 promised to cut it off. The fianc\u00e9 even went as far as unblocking them again recently. The author left the engagement because of this, even though there's no evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another girl despite promises to stop. The author felt it was necessary to end the relationship because the fianc\u00e9 couldn't seem to let go. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, in a relationship, trust and boundaries are crucial. The author had a legitimate concern here. They confronted the fianc\u00e9 multiple times, and each time he promised to stop but didn't follow through. Even after the author found out he unblocked the girl and her sister again, which shows a pattern of behavior that the author couldn't trust. In a committed relationship, especially with a child involved, maintaining boundaries with other people is important to prevent infidelity and to respect the partner's feelings.\n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9 didn't actually cheat, just stayed in contact. Some might argue that if there's no physical or emotional infidelity, maybe the author overreacted. However, the repeated broken promises and the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect the author's boundaries could be seen as a lack of respect for the relationship. The author has the right to feel insecure and to make decisions based on their comfort level. Ending the engagement because of a lack of trust is a personal choice, and without actual cheating, maybe some would say the author is making a big deal out of nothing. But others would say that trust is foundational, and if it's broken repeatedly, leaving is justified.\n\nAnother angle: the author snooped through the fianc\u00e9's phone. That could be a point against them. Snooping can be seen as a violation of privacy. However, given the context of the relationship and the previous issues, the author might feel it's necessary to protect themselves. Still, it's a gray area. The fianc\u00e9's anger and defensiveness when confronted might indicate he felt it was an invasion, which could contribute to the tension.\n\nBut the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 is not cheating but is repeatedly violating boundaries, the author has every right to leave. The author's decision is based on their need for trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to meet that need. Since there's no actual cheating, some might say the author is wrong to end the engagement, but others would argue that maintaining contact with someone in a way that breaches trust is a deal-breaker.\n\nIn relationships, what's acceptable varies. However, the repeated nature of the fianc\u00e9's actions and the author's justified frustration seem to support the author's decision. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing their emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
