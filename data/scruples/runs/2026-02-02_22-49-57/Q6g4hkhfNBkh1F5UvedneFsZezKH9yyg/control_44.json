During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a 7-year engagement with a son from a previous relationship. They broke up briefly 3 years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for life. After reconciling, the author expected him to cut contact. The fianc\u00e9 deleted her at first but then reconnected subtly through social media. The author discovered this, confronted him, and he promised to delete her again. This cycle repeated with the fianc\u00e9 unblocking the girl and her sister, leading the author to end the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated instances of the fianc\u00e9 not following through on promises to cut contact, the author's efforts to trust him despite evidence, and the emotional toll. The author is not accusing him of cheating but of emotional infidelity through ongoing contact with another woman. The fianc\u00e9 claims his actions were accidental or innocent, like liking old posts by mistake. However, the author feels betrayed and can't trust him anymore.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect: Is the author wrong for leaving? The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014keeping contact despite promises\u2014show a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The author tried multiple times to give him the benefit of the doubt, but the pattern continued. In a committed relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's trust, even without physical infidelity, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author's decision is based on their emotional well-being and the inability to sustain trust. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to leave when trust is repeatedly broken, even if the actions don't constitute cheating per se.\n"
