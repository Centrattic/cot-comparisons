During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. Let me go through the details carefully. \n\nThe situation starts with the couple being together for seven years, having a son. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut off contact with her. He did delete her from social media but later she was still there in a sneaky way\u2014blocking the author so they couldn't see their interactions. The guy liked all her pictures, not the author's, and the girl also liked his posts. \n\nAfter confrontation, he deleted her again, but the author checked later and found her still there. Then, he left for three days and promised again. But then there was another incident where he liked the girl's sister's pictures, claiming it was accidental. Now, the author discovered he unblocked both the girl and her sister. The author is considering leaving because he can't let go of this other girl, even if there's no proof of cheating.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong to leave. The key points here are trust, boundaries, and the impact on the child. The author has repeatedly confronted the fianc\u00e9, who has broken promises each time. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, show a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries and continuing contact in a deceptive way. The author's decision to leave is based on the lack of trust and the inability to resolve the issue. Since there's no actual cheating, some might argue it's not a betrayal, but the ongoing contact and dishonesty can erode trust. The author's well-being and the child's environment are important factors too. So, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving given the repeated breaches of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to commit to cutting off contact.\n"
