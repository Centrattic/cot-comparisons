During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her fianc\u00e9 have a child together. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, he started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They got back together, and she expected him to cut off contact. He initially did but later reconnected. The author snooped and found ongoing contact, including liking each other's posts, even after he swore he'd delete them. Despite multiple attempts by him to promise to stop, he keeps reconnecting, leading her to end the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are trust, communication, and boundaries. The author felt betrayed by his continued contact with the girl, even if there's no evidence of cheating. The fianc\u00e9 claims he was trying to remove them but accidentally re-liked posts. The author couldn't trust him anymore, so she ended the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks the trust by not following through on promises to cut off contact with someone that causes pain, it's understandable that the other partner would feel hurt and decide to leave. The author's actions, while involving snooping (which can be a red flag), were driven by her need to know the truth after his repeated assurances didn't hold up. The fianc\u00e9's inability to respect her boundaries by continuing to reconnect and not being transparent could be seen as the main issue.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's snooping is invasive and that she should have addressed the issue upfront without checking his phone. But given the context of multiple betrayals and his lack of follow-through, her actions might be seen as a last resort. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again shows a lack of commitment to the relationship, which can justify her decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made a choice based on the circumstances and the repeated breaches of trust. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the core issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
