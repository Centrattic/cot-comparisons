During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a child together. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with a girl he's known for a long time. The user says they found out about this contact after snooping, which the fianc\u00e9 had supposedly cut off. But he kept liking her photos again and again, even after promising to delete her. Then, recently, he unblocked both her and her sister. The user is considering ending the relationship because of this, even though there's no proof of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together a long time, and the fianc\u00e9 has a deep history with this girl. The user felt the contact was a problem and the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on his promises to cut ties. The user's actions included snooping, which might not be ideal, but that's part of the problem they're facing. \n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. The user expected their fianc\u00e9 to respect their boundaries by cutting off contact. The fact that he kept liking her photos and even unblocked them after promising to block shows a lack of commitment to those boundaries. Even if there's no cheating, the ongoing contact can be damaging to the relationship, especially if it's causing conflict and the person isn't making good faith efforts to stop. \n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9 might not be cheating, just maintaining contact. However, the user has a right to feel that this contact is a betrayal of trust, especially after repeated issues. The fianc\u00e9's actions of unblocking and continuing to like her photos could be seen as dismissive of the user's feelings and boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the user did snoop through his phone, which is a breach of privacy. But in this case, they might have done it out of concern and a history of broken promises. It's a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the fianc\u00e9 is the one who hasn't honored the agreed-upon boundaries, even after multiple confrontations. The user, while they snooped, is acting on their own discomfort and the lack of trust. Ending the engagement because of broken trust and the inability to set boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly broke trust, and the user has the right to end the relationship if they can't reconcile.\n"
