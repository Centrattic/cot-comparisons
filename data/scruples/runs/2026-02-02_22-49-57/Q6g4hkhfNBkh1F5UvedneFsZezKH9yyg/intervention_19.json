During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are the ongoing issue with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, the couple has a child together, which adds a layer of complexity because it's not just about their relationship but also about their son. The initial breakup happened three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to someone he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to stop contact with the girl. It seems reasonable because during a breakup, people might reconnect with others, but when they reconcile, the expectation is to put the past behind, especially if it causes issues in the current relationship.\n\nThen, when the author snoops and finds out he's still in contact, even liking her photos, that's a problem. The fianc\u00e9 becomes defensive but promises to stop, which he does for a while. But a month later, she finds out again. After another incident a few weeks ago with the girl's sister, he claims it was an accident. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister. The author feels betrayed and decides to leave.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is trust and boundaries. The fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly broken the trust by not following through on promises to cut contact. The author has evidence of ongoing communication, even if not explicit cheating. In relationships, trust is fundamental, and if one partner consistently violates the other's boundaries despite assurances, that can be a deal-breaker.\n\nThe author's actions (snooping) might be seen as an intrusion, but it's in the context of feeling unsafe and not trusting the fianc\u00e9's word. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might have his own feelings or reasons for not cutting ties, but the repeated behavior shows a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author has every right to feel that the relationship can't move forward without honesty and respect for her feelings. So, I think the author is justified in leaving, making the answer B.\n"
