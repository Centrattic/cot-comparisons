During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement, an almost 6-year-old son, and a breakup due to the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another girl.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. They broke up once before, got back together, and the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact with the girl. He initially deleted her, but then later, after several instances of finding her on social media again, the author leaves him. The key here is whether the author overreacted or if the fianc\u00e9 crossed a line.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 kept re-adding the girl and her sister despite promises to block them. The author used social media as evidence, not physical cheating. The fianc\u00e9 gave excuses like accidentally liking posts. The author's main issue is emotional infidelity, even without physical cheating.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Continuous breaches of trust, even if not physical, can be valid reasons to end a relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 couldn't follow through on promises to cut contact after multiple instances might indicate a pattern of disrespect towards the author's feelings. The author had to snoop, which isn't ideal, but the fianc\u00e9's actions required that. The author's decision to leave is a personal choice, and given the repeated violations, it's understandable. The father of their child is a complicating factor, but the author's well-being is also important. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship based on these repeated issues. They had the right to set boundaries and leave when those boundaries were breached.\n"
