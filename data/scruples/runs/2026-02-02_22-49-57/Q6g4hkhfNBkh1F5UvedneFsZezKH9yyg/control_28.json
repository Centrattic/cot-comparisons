During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he can't stop contacting another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation as described. The couple has been together for seven years with a child. They had a month-long breakup three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known most of his life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact with her. He initially deleted her but later reconnected. The author snooped and found he was still interacting with this girl, liked her photos, and even had her sister's posts. He swore he'd delete her each time, but kept reconnecting. Finally, she ends it.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong in ending the relationship. The key factors here are trust, boundaries, and the pattern of behavior. The fianc\u00e9 isn't cheating but is maintaining contact that the author finds disrespectful and hurtful. The author has a valid reason to feel betrayed if her partner repeatedly breaks his word to cut off contact with someone she's uncomfortable with. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity or consistent disrespect can be grounds for ending a relationship.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had snooped, which can be a breach of trust. But given the context of repeated violations of boundaries, her actions could be seen as a last resort. The fact that she's the parent of his child adds another layer; ending the relationship affects their child's stability. But if the relationship is toxic due to his actions, maybe it's necessary for her well-being.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on his promises and his dishonesty (like unblocking someone after swearing to block them) are significant. The author is taking a stand for her emotional health and setting boundaries. So, while some might say she should have handled it differently, the repeated breaches and lack of trust might make her decision justified. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
