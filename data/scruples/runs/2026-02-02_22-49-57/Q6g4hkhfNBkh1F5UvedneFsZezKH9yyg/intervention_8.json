During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement with the father of their child. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with an old friend, whom the author found out is being followed and interacted with on social media despite promises to cut ties. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, which they find unacceptable, leading to the decision to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has a long-term relationship and a child together. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with the author before, then they reconciled. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to end contact with this girl, which he initially did but later resumed contact with. The author discovered this contact multiple times, even after the fianc\u00e9 promised to stop. The last incident was the fianc\u00e9 unblocking the girl and her sister, which the author couldn't ignore.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, and I need to evaluate that. \n\nKey points to consider:\n1. The author's actions (snooping the phone) might be seen as invasive, but they were done out of concern for their partner's fidelity and trust. However, snooping can be a contentious issue in relationships.\n2. The fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to cut ties, despite promises, show a pattern of behavior that the author finds unacceptable. Trust is crucial in a long-term relationship, especially when there's a child involved.\n3. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't intend to re-like the pictures, but the author found him actively unblocking the girls. This action suggests intentional contact, which undermines trust.\n4. The author is ending the engagement, not the marriage, so maybe there's a chance of reconciliation, but they feel it's necessary for their own peace of mind and the relationship's future.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. In relationships, trust and communication are foundational. If one partner repeatedly violates the trust of the other, even without physical infidelity, it can be grounds for ending the relationship. The author has legitimate reasons to feel betrayed, especially since the contact is ongoing despite promises. The fianc\u00e9's behavior might be seen as emotionally unfaithful, which is a significant issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might not have crossed the line into cheating, just maintaining an emotional connection. However, the author's discomfort and the lack of resolution from the fianc\u00e9's side justify their decision. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the health of the relationship, which is important.\n\nLegally, in some places, emotional infidelity isn't grounds for divorce, but ethically, it's a personal decision. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to leave when trust is broken and the other party isn't making good-faith efforts to change.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on broken trust and the other party's consistent failures to meet agreed-upon boundaries.\n"
