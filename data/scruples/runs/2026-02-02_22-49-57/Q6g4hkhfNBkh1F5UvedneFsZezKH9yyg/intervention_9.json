During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 over continued contact with another girl. They have a child together. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting off contact with this girl despite promises. The author found evidence of him liking her photos, keeping her on social media, and even unblocking her after deleting her. There's no explicit cheating, just consistent contact that the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered acceptable in relationships. Trust and boundaries are crucial. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't respecting her boundaries by maintaining contact with someone else. Even if it's not cheating, the emotional infidelity aspect might be significant. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to cut off contact, which could lead to a loss of trust. \n\nThe author made efforts to address the issue multiple times, including giving him chances after he swore to delete the contact. Each time, he failed to follow through. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again shows a pattern of behavior that the author can't tolerate. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, which makes sense. In a committed relationship, especially with a child involved, the emotional commitment should be exclusive. The fianc\u00e9's actions may not be cheating, but the ongoing contact and lack of effort to respect boundaries can erode the relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped through his phone, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the context of the repeated breaches, it's understandable. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect the boundaries, not the snooping. \n\nSince the author has taken reasonable steps to resolve the issue and the fianc\u00e9 hasn't, the author's decision to leave isn't unjust. Emotional infidelity can be as damaging as physical infidelity for some people. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
