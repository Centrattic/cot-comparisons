During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 7-year engagement with a son, and after a breakup and getting back together, there's ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl. The author found out he's been liking her pictures, not blocking her, and even unblocking her again after promising to delete her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. The author has given examples where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on promises to cut off contact. The key here is that there's no direct evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact. The author felt it was necessary to leave because of the lack of trust and repeated broken promises.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. If someone keeps breaking promises related to boundaries, that can be a deal-breaker. The author tried to address the issue multiple times, even giving chances after the fianc\u00e9 swore to fix it. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock the girl and her sister suggests he's not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nThe author could argue that maintaining contact with another woman in this context is emotionally inappropriate, especially since there were previous breakups and tensions. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be seen as a lack of commitment to the relationship. On the other hand, some might say that just liking pictures isn't cheating, and the author overreacted. But considering the repeated instances and the effort to hide the contact, the author has grounds to feel betrayed.\n\nI think the author is justified in ending the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of disrespecting boundaries, and the author's decision is about self-respect and their child's well-being. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
