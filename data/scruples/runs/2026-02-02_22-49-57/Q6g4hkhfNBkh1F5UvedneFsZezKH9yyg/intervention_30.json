During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. They have a child together. The main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known for most of his life, even after promises to cut it off. The author discovered continued contact through social media likes and eventually decided to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Long-term relationships require trust and communication. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to end contact with this girl, even after being confronted multiple times. The author tried to address it each time, but the issue persisted. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 unblocked them again, after previous agreements, shows a pattern of behavior that the author found unacceptable.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated breaches of trust, the author's attempts to resolve the issue, and the fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through. While the author didn't have evidence of cheating, the ongoing contact and the fianc\u00e9's defensive reactions might make the author feel disrespected and unheard. In a relationship, mutual respect and honesty are crucial. If one partner consistently compromises the other's trust, it can lead to such a decision. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as self-preservation, prioritizing their emotional well-being. Ending a relationship after seven years is significant, but the circumstances\u2014ongoing dishonesty and broken promises\u2014could justify it. The presence of a child complicates things, but the author's decision might be aimed at protecting themselves and possibly setting boundaries for a healthier dynamic. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like seeking couples' counseling before leaving. However, given the repeated issues and the fianc\u00e9's lack of effort to change, it's understandable that the author felt leaving was necessary. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
