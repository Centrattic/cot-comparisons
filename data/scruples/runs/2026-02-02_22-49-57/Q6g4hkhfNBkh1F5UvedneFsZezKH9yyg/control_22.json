During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves her catching him maintaining contact with another girl he's known for most of his life, even after multiple promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. They've been together for seven years and have a child. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with this girl. There's a history of breaking up and getting back together, and she snoopeds his phone, which is a big deal in itself. She found instances where he liked the girl's photos on social media, and even after he supposedly deleted her, she was found again. Then, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked the girl and her sister after promising not to. The author left him because of this, even though there's no direct evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as a lack of commitment and trust, which are foundational in a long-term relationship, especially with a child. However, the author snooped through his phone, which is a breach of privacy. That complicates things because she used that method to find evidence. But she did so because she felt betrayed and wanted to protect her relationship.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 repeatedly failed to follow through on promises to cut contact, which shows a pattern of behavior. Even if it's not cheating, maintaining contact with an ex or someone close can be emotionally harmful if one partner feels it's a breach of trust. The author's decision to leave is based on her need for trust and security in the relationship. Since they have a child together, the impact on the child's well-being is also a factor.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he made mistakes but tried to correct them. The argument could be that the author took matters into her own hands by snooping, which might have contributed to the breakdown. However, the repeated breaches of trust from his side are significant. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the fianc\u00e9 couldn't or wouldn't stop the contact despite multiple confrontations, the author's decision to leave might be seen as necessary for her own well-being and the integrity of the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even without cheating, created a situation where trust couldn't be maintained. The author had valid reasons to end the relationship given the pattern of broken promises and her need for a trustworthy partnership.\n"
