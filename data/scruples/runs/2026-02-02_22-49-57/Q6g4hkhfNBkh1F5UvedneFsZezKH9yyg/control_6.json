During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a son together, and the main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 kept maintaining contact with a girl he knew for most of his life, even after multiple promises to cut her off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The relationship has been ongoing for 7 years, which is a significant amount of time. The couple had a breakup a few years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to stop contact with her. When he didn't, it led to conflicts. Then, the author snooped through his phone and found that he was still in touch, even liking her pictures on social media and vice versa. Despite multiple confrontations and promises to delete her, he kept reconnecting with her, even unblocking her and her sister recently.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the factors here. Infidelity is typically a major issue in relationships. However, in this case, there's no explicit mention of cheating\u2014just sustained contact with another woman, which the author finds unacceptable. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't physically cheated, but the emotional or social boundary has been crossed repeatedly. \n\nThe author's main issue is the lack of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on his promises. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them suggests that he's still maintaining contact despite the couple's agreement. Even if the author had to snoop to find out, the repeated breaches of trust are significant. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If one partner consistently violates the other's boundaries despite promises, it can be seen as a deal-breaker. The author might feel that the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting her feelings or the commitments they made to each other. The presence of a child together adds another layer, but it doesn't necessarily mean staying in an unhappy or untrustworthy relationship is the right choice. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially if there's no actual infidelity. However, the repeated actions and the effort to reconnect with the girl might indicate a deeper issue, like emotional attachment or lack of commitment. The fact that the author had to snoop multiple times shows that the fianc\u00e9 wasn't transparent, which is another red flag.\n\nSo, considering the intention to leave due to repeated breaches of trust and broken promises, even without physical cheating, the author might be justified in her decision. The wrong here would likely be the fianc\u00e9's actions, not the author's decision to leave. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
