During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they've been engaged for 7 years, have a kid together, and the guy keeps in contact with another girl despite the author asking him to stop. The author snooped and found evidence of ongoing contact, confrontations, and the guy didn't follow through on promises to cut the girl off. Now the author is ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another girl, which they find unacceptable. The guy claims it's innocent, but the author has evidence of repeated violations. The author has given him multiple chances to fix it, but it keeps happening. The question is whether ending the relationship is justified here.\n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are important. If one person repeatedly breaches the other's boundaries, that can be a valid reason to end the relationship, especially if there's no improvement after attempts to resolve it. The author tried to communicate, then confronted him after finding evidence, and he kept failing to comply. The author's actions (snooping) might be a point of contention. While it's understandable to want to know the truth, snooping can be seen as violating privacy. However, given the context of repeated issues and the stakes (a child involved), the author might feel it's necessary.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior\u2014keeping contact despite promises, not deleting the girl, liking her sister's posts\u2014could be seen as a pattern of disrespect towards the author's feelings. Even if there's no actual cheating, the emotional betrayal and lack of accountability are significant. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the health of the relationship, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that without proof of cheating, ending the relationship is extreme. But the author's trust has been broken multiple times, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't taking the issue seriously. The fact that he had to be confronted each time and still didn't change his behavior suggests a deeper issue, maybe of disrespect or commitment problems.\n\nConsidering all this, the author decided to end the relationship due to repeated breaches of trust and lack of effort to address the issue. The fianc\u00e9's actions have created an environment where the author can't feel secure, which is a legitimate reason to leave. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
