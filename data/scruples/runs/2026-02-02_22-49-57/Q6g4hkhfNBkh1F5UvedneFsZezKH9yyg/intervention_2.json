During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a son together. The main issue seems to be ongoing contact between the fianc\u00e9 and an ex, despite repeated promises to cut it off. The author discovered the fianc\u00e9 still liked the ex's photos, had them on social media, and even unblocked them recently. They believe this is a pattern of not respecting boundaries and trust issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is long-term, with a child. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not following through on commitments to cut off contact. The author has evidence of ongoing interactions, even if it's not physical cheating. Emotional infidelity can be a big deal for some people. The author tried multiple times to address the issue, leading up to their decision to leave.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's about expectations in a relationship. If the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly breaks promises and the author feels their trust is violated, then the author's decision might be justified. On the other hand, if the fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to fix things and there's no actual cheating, maybe the author is overreacting. But given the repeated incidents and the effort to hide contact, it's plausible the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
