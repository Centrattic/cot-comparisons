During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a 7-year engagement with their fianc\u00e9 and has a child together. Three years ago, they broke up for a month, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he'd known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut off contact with the girl. The fianc\u00e9 deleted her, but later, the author discovered that he was still in contact. The author snooped and found that he was liking the girl's pictures and vice versa. The girl had blocked the author on social media, making it harder to track. After multiple confrontations and promises to delete her, the fianc\u00e9 ended up unblocking them again. The author decided to end the relationship because of this pattern, even though there's no evidence of actual cheating, just continued contact.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9 broke up with them, then during the breakup, started talking to another girl. After getting back together, the fianc\u00e9 didn't fully cut off contact, leading to repeated issues. The author found evidence of ongoing contact despite promises to stop. The fianc\u00e9 had lied about deleting the girl, and even after multiple chances, he kept reconnecting with her. The author ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the ethical aspect. In a relationship, trust and honesty are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of deception and not following through on commitments. The author had a legitimate reason to be concerned, especially since they have a child together. The fianc\u00e9's behavior suggests a lack of respect for the author's boundaries and feelings. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on the fianc\u00e9's inability to maintain the trust necessary for the relationship to continue. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. But given the context\u2014repeated broken promises and the fianc\u00e9's secrecy\u2014it might be understandable as a response to protect themselves. The author isn't accusing of cheating but of ongoing contact, which is a red flag in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions may not be cheating per se, but they undermine the trust and commitment expected in an engagement, especially when there's a child involved.\n\nIn most relationships, maintaining boundaries around contact with exes is important. The fianc\u00e9's inability to respect those boundaries and the repeated failures to follow through on promises likely contributed to the author's decision. Ending a 7-year relationship is a significant step, but if the trust is irreparably broken, it might be the right choice. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking a healthy and honest relationship, especially for the sake of their child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
