During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl, despite the author's requests.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been going on for a long time, and they have a child together. The author took the initiative to check the fianc\u00e9's phone after feeling distant, which led to the discovery of interactions with this girl. The fianc\u00e9 had previously deleted her, but she came back, and now even the sister is involved. The author confronted the fianc\u00e9 multiple times, each time leading to promises to delete and block, but those promises weren't kept. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship based on evidence of continued contact, even without proven cheating. The author's actions\u2014snooping and then leaving\u2014might be seen as a last resort after repeated breaches of trust. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries, which is a significant issue in a long-term relationship. \n\nOn one hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by snooping, but in the context of a serious relationship with a child, trust and commitment are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut off contact could indicate emotional unavailability or lack of commitment, which is a valid reason to end the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he was trying to unlike the posts but made a mistake. However, the pattern is consistent: each time the author finds evidence, the fianc\u00e9 promises to stop, but it happens again. The author is justified in feeling that there's no genuine effort to address the issue. \n\nConsidering the long-term nature and the presence of a child, the author's decision to end the relationship due to repeated unfaithfulness (even if not physical cheating) might be seen as necessary for their own well-being and the integrity of the relationship. So the answer is B.\n"
