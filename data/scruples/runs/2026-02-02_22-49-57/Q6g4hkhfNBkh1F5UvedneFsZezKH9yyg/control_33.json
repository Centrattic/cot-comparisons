Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves repeated issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for seven years and has a child. Three years ago, they broke up briefly, and during that time, he talked to a girl he's known his whole life. They reconciled, but she expected him to cut all contact. He didn't, and this led to ongoing conflicts. The author snooped through his phone and found he was still in contact, even liking posts from the girl and her sister. He promised to delete them each time but kept reverting. Now, he's unblocked them again, leading the author to end the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the given info. Let's consider trust and respect in a relationship. Repeatedly breaking promises to cut contact with someone the partner is uncomfortable with can erode trust. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be seen as a breach of trust, especially after multiple assurances. However, there's no evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact. But in a long-term relationship, maintaining contact with someone in a way that causes distress can be problematic. The author's decision to leave is a personal choice, but is she in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat, but he didn't respect her boundaries consistently. The author felt her trust was broken, leading her to end the relationship. From an ethical standpoint, it's about whether the fianc\u00e9 wronged her by not respecting her wishes. However, the author's snooping might be a separate issue, but given the context of repeated breaches, it's understandable. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly violated her trust, even without actual cheating. The key here is the breach of trust and not honoring commitments.\n"
