During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9 because of ongoing contact with another woman. The fianc\u00e9 has a child with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were together for 7 years, had a child. There was a month-long breakup three years ago. During that time, the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known for a long time. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut off contact. He deleted her initially but then she came back again. The author found out he was still in contact, even liking her pictures, etc. He promised to delete her again, but later she was still there. Then he liked the girl's sister's photos. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship because of this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nI need to analyze the situation. The key points here are trust, communication, and boundaries in a long-term relationship. The author felt betrayed by the continued contact, even if there's no proof of cheating. The fianc\u00e9 kept making promises to cut off contact but failed, leading to the author's decision to leave.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, trust is crucial. The author's concern isn't just about the contact itself but the pattern of breaking promises and the emotional attention given to the other girl (liking her photos, etc.). The fact that the fianc\u00e9 didn't take the issue seriously and kept reconnecting suggests a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The author's decision is based on feeling that the relationship can't continue without trust, which is valid.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. But in the context of a long-term relationship where the author is genuinely concerned about their partner's loyalty, that might be understandable. The fianc\u00e9's actions of blocking and unblocking might be a red flag, showing he can't commit to the relationship's boundaries.\n\nThe author's main issue isn't cheating but the ongoing emotional connection and the partner's inability to respect the author's wishes. In such cases, it's a personal decision based on what the author feels is necessary for their well-being. Ending a relationship over broken promises and lack of trust is a common reason, and the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that choice, even if there's no actual infidelity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
