During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The situation involves repeated issues with him maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time, even after promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 broke up once before but got back together. The main issue is the ongoing contact with this other girl, which the author finds unacceptable. The author snooped through his phone multiple times and found evidence of continued contact, despite his promises to stop. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to like the pictures and that he was trying to unlike them, leading to accidental likes. However, the latest incident shows he unblocked both the girl and her sister, which suggests intentional reconnection.\n\nNow, assessing who is in the wrong. The author has a right to expect trust and commitment in a long-term relationship, especially when there are repeated breaches of that trust. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not outright cheating, indicate a lack of respect for the boundaries set by the author. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 unblocked them again after being asked to block them shows a pattern of dishonesty and disregard for the author's feelings. The author made multiple attempts to resolve the issue, but the fianc\u00e9's behavior kept escalating, leading her to end the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner repeatedly violates the trust and refuses to change despite clear discussions, it's reasonable for the other partner to end the relationship. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving, especially since she's given multiple chances for him to change, which he hasn't. The fianc\u00e9's actions, while not cheating, are emotionally damaging and show a pattern that the author can't tolerate. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
