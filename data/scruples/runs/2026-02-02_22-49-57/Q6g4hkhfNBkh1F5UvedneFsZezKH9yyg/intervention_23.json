During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9 because he keeps reconnecting with an ex. The situation involves multiple instances where the author found the fianc\u00e9 still in contact with this girl, despite promises to cut contact. The key points here are the repeated broken promises and the author's actions to check the fianc\u00e9's social media.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 had a previous separation and then a breakup, leading to this current situation. The author's main issue is the fianc\u00e9's inability to disconnect from this girl, even after multiple confrontations and promises. The author snooped through the phone each time, which might be a point of contention, but the fianc\u00e9's actions in maintaining contact could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The author felt betrayed and disrespected, which are significant emotional factors. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, could be considered emotionally unfaithful or at least a lack of commitment to the relationship. Repeated incidents like liking ex's photos and unblocking them might indicate a pattern of behavior that the author can't tolerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he was trying to unlike the posts and accidentally re-liked them. The author believed his explanation, but the recent unblocking is a deliberate action. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. In relationships, trust is crucial, and if one partner can't respect the other's boundaries, it's reasonable to end it.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They had valid reasons to feel betrayed and acted to protect their emotional well-being. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not physical infidelity, undermined the trust and commitment necessary for a healthy relationship. So the answer should be B.\n"
