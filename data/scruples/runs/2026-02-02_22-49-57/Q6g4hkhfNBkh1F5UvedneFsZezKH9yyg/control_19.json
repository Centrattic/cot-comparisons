During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years because he can't cut ties with another girl. They broke up once before, and after getting back together, he kept contact with this girl despite promises to stop. The author found out through snooping, and there were instances where he liked her photos, followed her on Snapchat, and later even unblocked her and her sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The fianc\u00e9 had a long-term relationship with the author, a child together. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's inability to cut off contact with another woman, which the author finds unacceptable. The author provided evidence of ongoing contact, even after promises to stop. The fianc\u00e9's defense was that he was trying to unlike the sister's posts but accidentally re-liked, and then later unblocked them again. \n\nNow, the author is leaving because of this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. \n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. The fianc\u00e9 broke multiple promises to cut off contact, which likely caused significant emotional distress. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a response to a broken trust and repeated violations of agreed-upon boundaries. While the fianc\u00e9 didn't necessarily cheat, maintaining contact with an ex could be considered emotionally harmful, especially if it's causing conflict. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which isn't always advisable. But in this context, the snooping was a result of the fianc\u00e9's secrecy, so the author might feel justified in checking. The repeated violations and the fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on promises could make the author's decision reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the fianc\u00e9 was genuinely trying to fix things and the author is overreacting to non-physical infidelity, some might say the author is too harsh. But given the prolonged nature of the issue and the multiple instances, it seems the author isn't just being overly sensitive but is responding to consistent behavior that erodes trust. \n\nThe key here is whether the fianc\u00e9's actions are considered a breach of the relationship's terms. If the author felt that cutting off contact was a necessary boundary and the fianc\u00e9 couldn't respect it, then the author isn't in the wrong. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock them again shows a pattern that the author can't accept. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The author is justified in ending the relationship due to repeated breaches of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to adhere to the agreed boundaries, even without proof of actual cheating.\n"
