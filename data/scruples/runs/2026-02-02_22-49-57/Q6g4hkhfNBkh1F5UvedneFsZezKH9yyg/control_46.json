During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement with a son, a breakup, and then the fianc\u00e9 reconnecting with an old friend despite the fianc\u00e9e's requests to cut contact. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly promises to delete the friend but keeps her on social media, even after being confronted multiple times. The author ends the engagement because they feel betrayed, even without proof of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the repeated failures to follow through on promises, the snooping (which is a red flag), and the emotional impact. The author's main issue is the ongoing contact with the girl, which they find unacceptable. The fianc\u00e9 claims it's accidental or a mistake, but the pattern suggests intentional behavior.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In many relationships, trust and transparency are crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaches the trust by not cutting off contact as agreed, that can be a deal-breaker. The author's decision to leave is based on their inability to trust their partner anymore.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's snooping sets a bad precedent and that the fianc\u00e9 might not have been cheating but just maintaining a friendship. But given the repeated incidents and the fianc\u00e9's defensive responses, it's more about consistent breaches of trust. The author isn't accusing of cheating but of not respecting their boundaries, which is a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nSo, considering the repeated violations and the resulting loss of trust, the author's decision to leave isn't in the wrong. Answer B (No) makes sense here.\n"
