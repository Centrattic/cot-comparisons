During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. Let me go through the details again.\n\nSo, the couple has a 6-year-old son. They broke up briefly three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They reconciled, but the author wanted him to cut all contact. He initially deleted her but later, the author found out he was still in contact, even liking her pictures and the sister's. He kept promising to delete her again, but kept unblocking them. The author finally left because of this ongoing issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are trust and betrayal. Even if there's no actual cheating, maintaining contact with someone in a way that the partner finds unacceptable can be a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9 didn't respect the author's boundaries, kept lying about deleting the girl, and continued to engage with her despite promises. That's a breach of trust.\n\nThe author had evidence of ongoing contact, which they found through snooping. While snooping isn't ideal, the situation shows a pattern of dishonesty. The fianc\u00e9's actions made the author feel insecure and untrusted. In a long-term relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks that trust, even if it's not physical infidelity, it can justify leaving.\n\nThe author's decision to leave is about their own well-being and the health of the relationship. They can't force someone to cut ties if they're unwilling. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their needs and ending a relationship where trust has been repeatedly broken.\n"
