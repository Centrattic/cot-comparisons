During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he keeps not cutting off contact with another girl. So, first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe key points here are that the couple has been together for seven years and has a child. There was a breakup period three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After they reconciled, the author expected him to cut contact, which he initially did but then kept reconnecting. The author found out through snooping, which she had to do multiple times to discover ongoing interactions. Each time, the fianc\u00e9 promises to delete the girl, but then fails, leading to the author leaving. Now, there's a recent incident where he unblocked her and her sister.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's decision to leave is justified. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't cheated, just maintained contact or reconnected with someone else. The author is hurt and lacks trust. But in relationships, trust is crucial. The repeated broken promises to cut contact could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Even if there's no actual cheating, the fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing emotional harm and making the author feel neglected. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, given the circumstances and the impact on the relationship, her actions might be understandable. The repeated failures to honor commitments to delete the contact suggest a lack of respect for her boundaries and feelings. The fact that she's the parent of their child adds complexity, but it's important to consider her well-being. \n\nIn terms of morality or social norms, many people might side with her, as she's trying to protect her marriage and emotional health. The fianc\u00e9's inability to let go of this other person, despite promises, shows a pattern of disrespecting her trust. So, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's acting to preserve her relationship's integrity and her own mental health, even if the situation doesn't involve physical infidelity. The key is the ongoing emotional harm and broken trust, which are significant enough for her to make this decision.\n"
