During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years, given the situation described. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The couple has been together for seven years, has a child together. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut all contact, which they thought was reasonable. \n\nThen there's this pattern of the fianc\u00e9 not following through. Even after deleting the girl's social media, he ends up reconnecting. The author snoops and finds he's liked the girl's pictures, not theirs. Confrontations happen, he promises to delete her, but then later she's still there. Then there's an incident with the girl's sister, and finally, he unblocks them again.\n\nThe main issue seems to be about ongoing contact with someone the author perceives as a threat, even after multiple promises to stop. The author doesn't have proof of cheating, just ongoing contact. The question is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of relationships. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly didn't honor his promises to cut contact, which led the author to loss of trust. The author took steps to check (snooping), which some might see as a breach of privacy, but the fianc\u00e9's actions might justify that. However, snooping can be seen as a problem in itself.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. Even after agreements to delete contact, he keeps reconnecting. This could indicate emotional unavailability or emotional infidelity, even if not physical. The author's decision to leave is based on trust issues and feeling that the relationship is unsustainable.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author left because they couldn't trust their partner and the partner's actions were consistent in violating boundaries, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author shouldn't have snoop through the phone, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the context, the author had reasons to feel insecure.\n\nSo, weighing the actions of both sides: the author acted in response to ongoing breaches of trust and promises, while the fianc\u00e9 failed to maintain the boundaries set. The author's decision to leave is a reaction to a pattern of behavior that eroded trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
