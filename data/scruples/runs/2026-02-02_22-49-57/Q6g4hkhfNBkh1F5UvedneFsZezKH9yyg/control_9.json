During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the couple has a long-term relationship with a child. There was a breakup three years ago where the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known a long time. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut contact. He deleted her initially but then later it's found that he's still in contact through social media, liking pictures, etc. The author snooped and found this multiple times, leading to confrontations. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to cut ties, and now the author left. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust issues, repeated breaches of trust, and the author taking action after multiple warnings. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014keeping contact despite promises, secretly unblocking, liking others' pictures\u2014suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author had evidence of ongoing contact, which is a breach of trust. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the consistent behavior might be enough to justify leaving if trust is broken. The author tried multiple times to resolve it, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. \n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner can't respect the other's boundaries, especially after multiple chances, it's understandable that the other might leave. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave due to broken trust. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
