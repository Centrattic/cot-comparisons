During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 of seven years. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the couple has a long-term relationship with a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconcile, but the author expects him to cut contact with her. He deletes her but later, the author finds out he's still interacting\u2014liking her posts, and even the sister's. There's some back and forth where he promises to delete them but doesn't, and the author eventually leaves.\n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. The author felt betrayed each time the fianc\u00e9 kept contact. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity or maintaining inappropriate boundaries can be a deal-breaker. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but the fianc\u00e9 kept going back. The author's decision to leave is based on repeated breaches of trust, even if there's no proof of cheating. In relationships, trust is foundational. If someone can't respect their partner's boundaries despite promises, it's understandable why the author would leave. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
