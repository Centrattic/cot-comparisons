During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with an ex-girlfriend and her sister, even after promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, the couple has a long history and a child together. The author discovered that the fianc\u00e9 was still in contact with the girl, even after previous confrontations and promises to delete her. The fianc\u00e9 liked her photos, didn't engage with the author's content, and even unblocked them again recently. The author believes this is a pattern of dishonesty and emotional infidelity, even if there's no proof of actual cheating.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions (liking ex's photos, not deleting her, re-adding them) show a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. Emotional infidelity can be as damaging as physical cheating, especially when there are repeated instances and broken promises. The author had to check his phone multiple times, indicating a breakdown in trust.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's excuses (accidentally re-liking, forgetting) don't hold up given the pattern. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again suggests intentional behavior. The author's decision to leave is based on the inability to trust the fianc\u00e9, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship. Since there's no evidence of cheating, but there is consistent emotional betrayal, the author is justified in prioritizing their own well-being and their child's stability by ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
