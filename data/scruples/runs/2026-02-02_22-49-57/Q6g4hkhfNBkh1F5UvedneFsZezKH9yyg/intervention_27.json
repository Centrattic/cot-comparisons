During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl he's known for most of his life, even after promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The couple has a child together, which adds complexity. The fianc\u00e9 had broken up with the author for a month, during which he started talking to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to end contact. He initially deleted her but later reconnecting multiple times, even going as far as unblocking her and her sister recently. The author found evidence through snooping, which might be a point of contention. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to like the pictures again, but the author has to deal with this recurring issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break down the possible factors. Trust is a big issue here. The fianc\u00e9's repeated actions\u2014despite promises\u2014could indicate a pattern of dishonesty or lack of commitment. The author's decision to leave after multiple breaches of trust might be seen as justified. However, snooping into the phone could be seen as invading privacy, which might weigh against the author. But considering the context of ongoing issues and the parent-child aspect, maybe the author is within their rights to prioritize their well-being and their child's stability.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's actions (liking ex's pictures, unblocking her) suggest emotional involvement beyond casual contact, even if there's no proof of cheating. The author's decision is to protect their own emotional health and their child's environment. In such cases, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The key here is the pattern of behavior versus a one-time mistake. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut ties despite repeated promises might make the author's choice reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014trust issues, parental responsibilities, repeated breaches\u2014the author is likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
