During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement because their fianc\u00e9 can't cut off contact with another girl.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has a 6-year-old son, which adds emotional weight. They broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known his whole life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact. He did delete the girl initially but later had her liked on social media, leading to more conflict. The author snoopily checked his phone again and found ongoing contact, including liking the girl's sister's posts. The fianc\u00e9 kept promising to cut ties but kept failing, and the author ultimately left.\n\nNow, considering trust and commitment in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9 is the father of the author's child, so the stakes are high. The author has legitimate concerns about his inability to follow through on promises to end contact, which could indicate a lack of respect for the relationship or potential emotional infidelity. Even without physical cheating, consistent communication and liking posts with someone else might be seen as emotionally unfaithful, especially if it's ongoing despite promises to stop.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern: he deletes the girl, then later re-likes posts, unblocks them, and gives excuses. The author's decision to leave is based on these repeated breaches of trust. In relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner cannot be trusted to cut off contact with someone that causes distress, it's understandable that the other might end things. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't physically cheated, so maybe the author overreacted. But given the context\u2014seven years together, a child, and multiple failed attempts to fix the issue\u2014it's a significant deal. The author's actions, while involving snooping, were in response to genuine concerns that weren't resolved. The fianc\u00e9's pattern suggests he's not prioritizing the relationship's health, which is a valid reason to leave.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their emotional well-being and the integrity of their relationship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
