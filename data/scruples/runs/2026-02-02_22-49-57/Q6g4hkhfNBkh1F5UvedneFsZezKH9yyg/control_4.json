During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong after ending a 7-year engagement with the father of her child. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl, the evidence of social media interactions, and the author's decision to leave.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 has a history of not cutting off contact with this girl despite promises. The author found evidence of him liking her posts, even after deleting her. Then, there were instances where he failed to block her again, and recently unblocked both her and her sister. The author has a child with him, so this isn't a minor relationship\u2014there are real-life consequences for their son.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. The user is asking for a judgment. The main factors here are trust, commitment in a long-term relationship, and the impact on the child. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continually not following through on promises to cut ties\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. In a committed relationship, especially one that's been ongoing for seven years and has a child together, maintaining boundaries is crucial. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept violating those boundaries, even after multiple warnings and confrontations, might justify the author's decision to end things.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snoop through his phone, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, given the circumstances and the prior conflicts, her concern for the relationship's stability and her son's well-being might be considered a valid reason. Also, the fianc\u00e9's actions were repeated and intentional, which could override the privacy issue.\n\nThe author isn't accusing him of cheating, just of maintaining contact, which still seems to be a significant enough issue for her. In relationships, trust is foundational, and if one partner consistently can't respect the other's boundaries, it can lead to the relationship's breakdown. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to honor commitments and the impact on their family are substantial. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
