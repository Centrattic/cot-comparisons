During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The author is considering breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 after seven years because he keeps maintaining contact with another girl, even after promises to cut it off. They have a child together, so the stakes are high.\n\nFirst, the key points: They broke up briefly before, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. When they reconciled, the author expected him to stop contact. He did delete her initially but then reconnected later without the author's knowledge. The author found out by snooping through his phone, which might be a red flag in itself. The fianc\u00e9's actions include liking the girl's pictures repeatedly, not liking the author's, and even unblocking her and her sister again recently.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving over this, especially since there's no evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact. The question is whether the author's decision is justified.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, trust is broken. The fianc\u00e9 keeps breaking promises to cut off contact, which causes emotional distress. The author feels they can't rely on his word, leading to the decision to end the relationship. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating, just maintaining a friendship, and maybe the author is being overly controlling by snooping and taking it that far.\n\nBut the repeated violations of trust here are significant. Even if there's no physical cheating, the emotional betrayal of maintaining contact with someone else when asked to stop can be damaging. The fact that the author's fianc\u00e9 had to be confronted multiple times and kept breaking promises shows a lack of respect for their boundaries. The author's need to snoop might not be right, but the underlying issue is his ongoing actions that hurt the relationship.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is problematic, and the author has a right to feel that the relationship can't continue if trust can't be maintained. The answer would probably be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, are a breach of trust and the author is justified in seeking a resolution to protect their emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship.\n"
