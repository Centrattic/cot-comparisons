During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after multiple instances of him not cutting off contact with an ex, even though there's no actual cheating involved.\n\nSo first, the situation: They've been together for 7 years, have a child, broke up for a month, got back together. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to stop all contact with this girl they've known for a long time. He did delete her once, but then later reconnected after the author found out again. The final straw was unblocking both the girl and her sister, even though the author believed the previous excuses and didn't find evidence of cheating beyond staying in contact. The author is considering leaving and wants to know if it's their fault.\n\nHmm. The key elements here are trust, boundaries, and repeated breaches of those boundaries. The author felt that after getting back together, it was reasonable to expect the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact with the ex. The fianc\u00e9 did delete her once, but then kept reconnecting. The author snooped because trust was broken, which might be a point of contention, but in a long-term relationship, that can be a response to feeling betrayed. The repeated actions suggest a pattern, not a one-time mistake. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's behavior is creating emotional distress and undermining the relationship.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the author's boundaries and a sign of emotional entanglement. The author's decision to leave is based on trust issues and the inability to maintain the agreed-upon boundaries. In such cases, if the partner can't or won't respect the other's needs, even without actual infidelity, it's often a valid reason to end the relationship. The author might have tried to address the issue multiple times, and the fianc\u00e9's pattern of not following through could justify the decision, especially when the author's mental well-being is at stake.\n\nBut some might argue that the author snooped, which isn't honest, and that the fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat. They might say that without proof of infidelity, the author's actions are overreacting. However, the ongoing conflict and the fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to meet expectations could be considered a breach of trust in their own right. The author has a right to feel secure in the relationship, and if that's being compromised, leaving is a personal choice but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their emotional health and the respect of boundaries in a long-term commitment. The fianc\u00e9's inability to maintain those boundaries despite promises is the main issue here.\n"
