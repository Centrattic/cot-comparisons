During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement. The key points are:\n\n- The fianc\u00e9 and author have a 6-year-old son and were together for 7 years.\n- They broke up briefly 3 years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he knew for most of his life.\n- After reconciling, the author expected him to cut contact, but he didn't. When confronted, he deleted her from social media but kept her on Snapchat.\n- The author snooped and found he was still in contact, liking her pictures and the sister's, even after promises to block her. The fianc\u00e9 gave various excuses, like accidentally reliking.\n- The author finally leaves because he can't let go of the girl, even though there's no proof of cheating.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nHmm. From the scenario, the author felt betrayed and disrespected by repeated broken promises. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, show a pattern of dishonesty and lack of commitment to the relationship. The author had valid reasons to feel insecure and betrayed. Since there's no evidence of cheating, but consistent behavior that undermines trust, the author's decision to leave might be seen as justified. The fianc\u00e9's inability to honor his commitments likely caused the breakdown. So, the answer is B.\n"
