During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl, despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for years. After getting back together, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to end all contact, which he seemed to do but later resumed. The author discovered ongoing communication through social media, including liking photos and not deleting contacts even after being asked. The fianc\u00e9 gave promises each time but failed, leading the author to leave.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they aren't, but wants another opinion. \n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. The author kept finding the fianc\u00e9 in contact with the other girl despite repeated assurances. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting the author's trust and boundaries. Even if there's no evidence of cheating, the ongoing contact can be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially since it's the same girl over multiple instances. The author's decision to leave after the fianc\u00e9 unblocked them again might be understandable given the history of broken promises.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be a point of contention. But considering the context\u2014repeated issues and the fianc\u00e9's failure to address them\u2014it might be justified. The fact that the author tried to resolve the issue multiple times before taking the final step shows they gave it a chance.\n\nSo, considering the pattern of behavior, lack of trust, and the author's efforts to maintain the relationship, it's likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
