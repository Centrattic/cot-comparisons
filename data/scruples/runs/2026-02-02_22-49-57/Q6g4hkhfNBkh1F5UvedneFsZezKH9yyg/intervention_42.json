During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. They have a child together and there's a history of the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The fianc\u00e9 has a long-term relationship but has been in contact with a girl he's known for most of his life. After a breakup and reconciliation, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to stop all contact. However, despite confrontations and promises, the fianc\u00e9 continues to engage with this girl, even going as far as unblocking her and her sister recently. The author found evidence of ongoing contact, including liking posts, which the fianc\u00e9 tried to explain away. The author decided to end the engagement because they couldn't trust him anymore.\n\nNow, trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, especially one as long-term as seven years. The repeated breaking of promises to cut off contact would likely erode trust. Even if there's no proof of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's actions show a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The author has valid reasons to feel betrayed, as the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on his commitments, leading to the decision to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, given the context of repeated issues and the fianc\u00e9's defensive reactions, the author's actions might be considered a response to justified concerns about the relationship's integrity.\n\nConsidering all factors\u2014the ongoing deception, broken promises, and the impact on their marriage\u2014the author's decision to leave is a reasonable response to protect their own well-being and the future of their family. The fianc\u00e9's inability to honor commitments and maintain boundaries is the core issue here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
