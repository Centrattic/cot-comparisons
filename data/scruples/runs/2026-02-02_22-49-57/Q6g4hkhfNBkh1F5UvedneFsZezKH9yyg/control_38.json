During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after a seven-year relationship because of ongoing issues with him not cutting off contact with another girl. The key points here are the timeline of events, the nature of the communication, and the evidence of the fianc\u00e9's actions.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for seven years with a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, and the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After reconciling, the author expected him to stop contact with her. When he didn't, there were confrontations, and he deleted her but later was found to still have contact. The author snooped and found likes on the girl's and her sister's posts, leading to more confrontations. The fianc\u00e9 promised to delete them again but failed, and now the author is ending the relationship.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer. The author's actions are based on feeling betrayed and not being able to trust the fianc\u00e9 despite his promises. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't cheated, just maintained contact. But the author felt it was necessary to end the relationship because of the ongoing pattern and lack of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks promises and maintains contact with someone that causes emotional distress to the other, it can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The author tried multiple times to address the issue, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. The author's decision is based on self-respect and the well-being of the relationship. Since there's no evidence of cheating, but there's a pattern of behavior that the author can't overlook, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional health.\n"
