During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation is complicated because there's no actual cheating, but there's ongoing contact with another girl, which the author is uncomfortable with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The couple has been together seven years and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 had a month-long breakup three years ago, and during that time he started talking to a girl he knew from before. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut ties, which he did initially but then resumed contact without her knowing. There were multiple instances where the author found out he liked the girl's photos or kept her unblocked. The fianc\u00e9 gave explanations each time, like accidentally re-liking or not knowing the sister was connected. The author finally left when he unblocked them again.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to leave. The fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat, but there's a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries and continued contact with someone that causes conflict. Trust issues are a big part of relationships. If the author feels that the fianc\u00e9 can't respect her boundaries, that's a valid reason to leave. However, arguments can be made that the author is being overly controlling or that the fianc\u00e9 isn't cheating, just failing to communicate effectively.\n\nBut looking at the pattern over three years, multiple instances of breaking promises to cut contact, and the author's justified frustration, it seems like she has a right to leave. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is harmful to the trust in the relationship. Even if there's no cheating, the lack of effort to address her concerns and the repeated breaches might make the author's decision reasonable. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
