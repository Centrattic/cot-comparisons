During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he kept staying in contact with another girl.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. They broke up once before for a month, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut off contact, which he did initially. But later, the author found out he was still in touch with the girl, even liking her social media posts. When confronted, he promised to delete her, but she kept resurfacing. The author ended the relationship because he couldn't let go of this other girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nThe author is asking if she's wrong for leaving. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's in a committed relationship and feels betrayed by his ongoing contact with another woman. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the continued communication is a breach of trust. In relationships, trust is crucial, and the fact that he broke his promises to cut off contact might be a valid reason for her to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 argues that he's just maintaining contact with someone he's known for a long time. Maybe he doesn't see it as a problem, or perhaps it's a friendship. But the author is clearly hurt and feels that he's not respecting her boundaries. The key here is whether the contact is considered appropriate in a committed relationship. If the fianc\u00e9 promised to delete her but kept her in his social media, that's a breach of promise, which could justify the author's decision.\n\nAlso, considering they have a child together, the situation is more complex. The author might be prioritizing her own well-being and the health of the relationship over staying in a situation where trust is broken. Ending a relationship to protect one's emotional health is often seen as a responsible decision, especially when there's a pattern of unfaithfulness or dishonesty.\n\nBut does the author have the right to snoop through his phone? That could be a point where she might be in the wrong. However, given the circumstances, she felt the need to do so because of the repeated issues. It's a gray area, but maybe the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's actions rather than her snooping.\n\nSince there's no actual cheating, the author might be ending the relationship over emotional infidelity or jealousy. However, the persistence of contact despite promises could be seen as emotional unavailability or lack of commitment, which is a valid reason to leave.\n\nSo overall, considering the repeated breaches of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect boundaries, the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
