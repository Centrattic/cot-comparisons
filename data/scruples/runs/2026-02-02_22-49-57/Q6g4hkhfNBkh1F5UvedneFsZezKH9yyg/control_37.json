During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-term relationship where there's been repeated issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl. The author is considering ending the 7-year relationship because of this, even though there's no evidence of actual cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has been in a committed relationship for seven years and has a child with their partner. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 keeps reconnecting with this girl, even after promises to cut contact. The author discovered this through snooping, which might complicate things because privacy is a factor. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might argue that he's not cheating, just maintaining a friendship.\n\nBut wait, the author's trust is being broken. Even if it's not cheating, consistent contact with someone else in a committed relationship can be a deal-breaker. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 had to delete and re-add the girl and her sister suggests a pattern of dishonesty. The author has tried to address it multiple times, and each time it's happened again. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he's not intentionally reconnecting. For example, he says he accidentally re-liked pictures. But the author points out that he went out of his way to unblock them, which contradicts his claim. So maybe there's a pattern of deception here.\n\nAlso, the author's actions of snooping might be seen as a breach of trust. However, given the context of repeated issues, maybe the author felt it was necessary to protect their relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions might have given the author reason to feel insecure and need reassurance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual respect and trust. If one partner is consistently violating the other's trust, even without physical cheating, it's a serious issue. The author is ending the relationship because they can't maintain trust anymore. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't been able to honor his commitments, leading to repeated hurt.\n\nI think the author is justified in ending the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions, while not infidelity, have caused significant emotional harm and broken trust. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being and the health of the relationship.\n"
