I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious, but her family is. She asked him to go with her to church on Easter, which she used to do every year with her family. He refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight about it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's not religious, and he's being honest about his beliefs. He thinks she's not religious either, since she only goes for holidays. She did go with her family before, but maybe now she's struggling with her grief and wants some comfort from tradition. She asked him to support her by going, but he didn't, which upset her. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is dealing with her father's death. Grief can make people rely more on traditions for comfort. Even if she's not typically religious, this might be her way of coping. She asked him to go with her, which is a request for emotional support. By refusing, he might have felt he wasn't supporting her during a hard time. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests she felt he wasn't there for her despite his claims of wanting to be supportive.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the key here is about empathy and support. Even if they aren't religious, showing up to support her in a meaningful way for her could be important. The author might have prioritized his own beliefs over her emotional needs. The question is whether respecting her emotional needs (by accompanying her) is more important than his stance on religion. \n\nAlso, he said they don't need to go now since she's not religious. But she might be using the tradition to cope, which he didn't consider. So maybe he should have gone along, even if he didn't believe, just to support her. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether supporting her emotional needs in her time of grief takes precedence over his personal beliefs. If the relationship requires compromise, then not going might be seen as not being supportive enough. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
