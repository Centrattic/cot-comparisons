I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her father died. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church a lot when she was younger. Now, her dad is gone, and she wanted to attend Easter church with her partner. The author says they're not religious at all, and the girlfriend isn't super religious either but has family traditions. The author refused to go, leading to an argument.\n\nHmm, so the key points here: The girlfriend is trying to connect with her family's traditions during a difficult time, and the author is not willing to accommodate that. The author argues that the girlfriend isn't really religious now and that they don't need to go. But the girlfriend is emotional about it, maybe using it as a way to process grief or maintain family ties.\n\nIs the author wrong for not going? Well, considering the context, it's about supporting someone during grief. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up for her might be important. The girlfriend mentioned she can't fly home, so going to church might be her way of honoring her dad or family. The author's refusal might be seen as not being supportive, even if they don't believe. But the author also has their own beliefs. However, in relationships, compromise is often necessary. The author could have found a way to participate minimally, even if not believing, to show solidarity. So maybe they're in the wrong because support during grief is crucial, and respecting her needs, even if they differ, is part of being a partner. But the girlfriend also said she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. Wait, she asked him to go, but maybe she's conflicted. If she's not sure, but he refused, maybe he didn't respect her wishes. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Because even if they're not religious, supporting the partner's emotional needs during a tough time is important. The author's refusal might have been a failure to show that support, especially since the girlfriend was trying to connect with her roots and process her grief. The fact that the girlfriend is now upset and the argument happened suggests that the author's stance hurt her feelings. Even if the author's beliefs are valid, in a relationship, sometimes you have to make an effort for the other person's emotional well-being.\n"
