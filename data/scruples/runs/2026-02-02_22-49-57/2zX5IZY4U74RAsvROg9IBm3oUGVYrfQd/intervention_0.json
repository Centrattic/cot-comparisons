I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died, specifically during Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author isn't very religious, and neither is his girlfriend, though she sometimes goes to church for major holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is very religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. The dad passed away a few months ago, and she's been trying to cope. The girlfriend asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He mentioned they don't need to go since she's not that religious, which led to a big argument. The girlfriend is upset, but the author feels he's justified.\n\nSo the core issue is whether not attending church in this context is wrong. The author's reasoning is that he's not religious and doesn't believe in it, and he thinks the girlfriend isn't either. However, the girlfriend might be using the church service as a way to connect with her family or find comfort, especially after her dad's death. Even if she's not very religious, traditions might have emotional significance for her. The author dismissing it as not needed could be seen as not respecting her emotional needs or her family's traditions.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not pretending to be religious. The girlfriend did say she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. If she's not going for religious reasons but maybe for family tradition, the author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in her time of need. However, if she's not interested either, maybe the author's point is valid. But the fact that it led to a fight suggests there's more at stake for her than just the religion\u2014maybe it's about support or respecting her family's wishes in her dad's memory.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author is being honest about his lack of belief, which is fair, but maybe he could have shown more empathy and found a different way to support her without attending church. The question is whether refusing to attend was inconsiderate. If the church was a meaningful tradition for her family, especially during a time of grief, his refusal might be seen as not being supportive. However, if she's not going for the same reasons, maybe the author isn't the one at fault. I need to weigh the importance of respecting her emotional needs vs. his personal beliefs.\n"
