I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The key points here are the girlfriend's family's religious background, her own occasional attendance, and the specific request during Easter.\n\nFirst, the author isn't religious, and the girlfriend isn't either, except for holidays. The family is very religious, so the girlfriend went to church with them when they wanted her to. Now, her dad died recently, and the girlfriend asked the author to attend church with her on Easter. The author declined because they don't want to sit through the service and don't believe in it. They argued about traditions, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong. The girlfriend's situation is emotional, dealing with grief, and the author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her. Even though the author claims the girlfriend isn't religious, maybe attending church is important for her healing and connecting with her family. The author's reasoning is about personal beliefs, but in a relationship, sometimes you have to make sacrifices. The fact that the author mentioned they don't even need to go now might be dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend might need the support even if she says she doesn't want to go. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her emotional needs and traditions during a difficult time.\n"
