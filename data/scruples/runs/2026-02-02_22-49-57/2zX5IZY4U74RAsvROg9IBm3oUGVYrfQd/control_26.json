I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't go to church with their girlfriend after her dad's death is in the wrong. They both aren't very religious, but her family is. She asked him to go to Easter church, which he refused because he doesn't believe and didn't want to sit through the service. He argues that she isn't that religious either.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respecting traditions and emotional support. The girlfriend might be using the church as a way to cope with her grief, even if she's not super religious. The guy might not see the value in it, but maybe she needs that emotional support from him. By refusing, he's not supporting her in her time of need, even if it's something he personally doesn't believe in. \n\nOn the other hand, his reasons are valid too. He's being honest about his beliefs and his discomfort with church services. But relationships often require compromise. If she's not religious but still wanted to go for her family's sake or her own emotional processing, he might need to respect that even if it's not his thing. \n\nThe fight turned into a big deal because traditions and personal beliefs collided. The answer might depend on whether emotional support in a relationship supersedes personal beliefs. The guy might be in the wrong if he's not willing to make that effort, but maybe not if he's being honest. However, since she's crying and it's a significant tradition, not supporting her could be seen as wrong. So probably answer A.\n"
