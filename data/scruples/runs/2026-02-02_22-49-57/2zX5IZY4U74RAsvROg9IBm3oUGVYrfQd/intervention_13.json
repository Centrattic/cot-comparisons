I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The author says neither he nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them, especially on holidays like Easter. Her dad passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter. He refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with her father's death, which is a significant emotional event. Church services might be part of her coping mechanism or a way to honor her father's memory. The author argues that they don't need to go since they're not religious, and the girlfriend herself said she doesn't really want to go. But the fact that she asked him to go suggests she might still value the gesture, even if she's not super religious now. \n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in her time of need, even if he's not religious. However, he also points out that she's not very religious either, so maybe she's conflicted about going. The key points here are about support in grief and respecting personal choices. \n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about his beliefs and doesn't want to participate in something he doesn't believe in. On the other hand, showing up for her might be a way to show support, regardless of personal beliefs. The girlfriend's emotional reaction indicates that this was important to her, even if she's not religious now. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's being honest about his beliefs. However, maybe he could have found a compromise, like attending part of the service or offering other forms of support. But since the girlfriend herself said she doesn't really want to go, maybe his refusal is justified. But the fact that she asked him might mean she wanted him to be there for her emotionally, not necessarily for religious reasons. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance. The author isn't forcing her to go; he's refusing because he doesn't believe in it. The girlfriend's own ambivalence might mean that the author's refusal isn't entirely his fault. However, the emotional impact on her is significant. Maybe it's a gray area, but leaning towards B.\n"
