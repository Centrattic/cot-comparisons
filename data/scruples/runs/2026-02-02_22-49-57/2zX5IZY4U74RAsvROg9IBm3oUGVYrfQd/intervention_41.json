I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The main points are: they're both not very religious, the girlfriend's family is religious, she went to church with them before. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with him, but he refused because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author isn't religious, and the girlfriend isn't either, but her family is. The request was for Easter, a significant time for her family. Her dad's death might have made this church visit more about honoring him or her family's traditions, even if she isn't religious herself. He says she even stated she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. If she wanted to go for her family's sake, but he refused, maybe the issue is about respecting her emotional needs versus his beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's stance is that he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through the service. He's not being hypocritical because he's honest about his beliefs. However, in a relationship, sometimes you need to make compromises for each other's emotional well-being. The fact that she was upset suggests that this might be important to her for reasons beyond religion\u2014like family tradition or her grieving process. Even if the church isn't meaningful to him, attending could be a gesture of support.\n\nBut the author argues that she doesn't really want to go. If that's the case, maybe the fight was unnecessary. However, if she asked for his company, maybe she wanted the support regardless of the activity. The key here is whether attending church was a way for her to connect with her family's traditions or to honor her dad, and the author's refusal might have been a missed opportunity for support. However, forcing oneself to go to church against one's beliefs might not be genuine support.\n\nThe answer hinges on the balance between respecting personal beliefs and supporting a partner's emotional needs. If the author is right that she doesn't really want to go, maybe she's conflicted. But if she wanted to participate for her own reasons, his refusal could be seen as not being there for her. However, since they both aren't religious, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the importance of the gesture. It's a tricky situation where both perspectives have merit. The answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for him to consider her feelings more.\n"
