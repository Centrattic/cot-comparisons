I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author explains that they aren't religious, their girlfriend isn't either except for major holidays like Christmas and Easter. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Now, after her dad's death, she asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he doesn't believe and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend felt it was important for traditions, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't religious, and the girlfriend isn't either except for family traditions. The request comes after a loss, which is a sensitive time. The author's refusal is based on personal beliefs and discomfort with the service. However, the girlfriend might be seeking comfort or connection through tradition during a difficult time. \n\nNow, the key points: Did the author show support? He says he's been there for her until this point. But when she asked for something specific (attending church), he refused. The question is about respect for her needs versus his own beliefs. In relationships, compromise is often important. Even if the author isn't religious, acknowledging the symbolic or emotional importance of the request could be seen as a way to support her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forced to attend if he's uncomfortable. The girlfriend also said she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. Maybe she's going for tradition or family expectations, not personal belief. So why did she ask the author to go? Perhaps to show solidarity or because she feels she needs the support. \n\nThe author's stance is about personal beliefs, but in a relationship, sometimes you have to navigate each other's needs. The answer might depend on cultural context too. If the family is very religious, attending church could be a way to honor the deceased father. The author not attending might be seen as not respecting her family's wishes or her emotional needs during mourning. \n\nBut the author also has the right to his beliefs. However, the girlfriend might feel that his refusal is a lack of support. The initial response was a \"no\" without offering alternatives. Maybe the author could have suggested another way to support her, like attending part of the service, or doing something else she finds comforting. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not black and white. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not attending, but not considering the emotional significance might be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction (crying, sulking) indicates she felt the request was important. So the author's refusal, while based on his beliefs, might have dismissed her emotional needs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't try to find a middle ground or understand the importance of the gesture for her.\n"
