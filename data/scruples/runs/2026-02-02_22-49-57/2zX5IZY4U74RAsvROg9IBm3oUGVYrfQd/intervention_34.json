I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend aren't very religious. The author isn't religious at all, and the girlfriend only goes to church occasionally, like on Christmas and Easter. Her family is very religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted her to. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to deal with that. The author has been supporting her, but when she asked him to go to church with her on Easter, he refused. He gave two reasons: he doesn't want to sit through the entire service and he doesn't believe in it. He also said that since she's not very religious, they don't need to go. This led to a big fight about traditions, and she's upset now. The author feels bad but doesn't see the point of going. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo the key points here are the author's refusal to attend a religious service, the girlfriend's family traditions, her emotional state after her father's death, and the impact of the author's decision on their relationship.\n\nI should consider cultural and emotional aspects. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and attending Easter services might be a significant tradition for them, especially after a loss. The girlfriend might be seeking comfort in these traditions. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time. On the other hand, the author isn't religious and might feel uncomfortable being in a place he doesn't believe in. The girlfriend herself said she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. If she's not really interested, why is she asking him to go? Maybe she's trying to honor her family's traditions even if she's not fully on board. The author's response that they don't need to go because she's not religious might be dismissive of her personal needs, even if they're tied to her family's expectations.\n\nThe author's stance is about personal beliefs, but supporting a partner in their time of grief might require flexibility. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up might be a gesture of support, regardless of his own beliefs. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings. Even if she's not religious, the act of going together could be meaningful for her. The author might be right in that he doesn't believe, but the impact on their relationship is a factor. Maybe there's a middle ground, like going for a part of the service or attending a different activity that's comforting. But he refused outright. \n\nSo the question is whether the author's refusal is inconsiderate of her emotional needs. Even if the author isn't religious, respecting her family's traditions and her personal coping mechanisms could be important. The answer might depend on how much weight is given to the author's personal beliefs versus the girlfriend's emotional needs. If the girlfriend feels that attending church is a way to honor her father or find comfort, the author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her. However, if the girlfriend truly isn't interested in going, the author's point holds. But she did ask him to go, even if she said she doesn't want to. That seems contradictory. Maybe she's conflicted between her family's expectations and her own feelings. The author's refusal might not be the wrong, but there's room for misunderstanding. \n\nI think the author is not entirely wrong because he's being honest about his beliefs and she acknowledged she doesn't really want to go either. However, the way he dismissed her request might have been hurtful. Maybe a better approach would be to find an alternative way to support her instead of a direct refusal. But given the information, if both are not religious, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But the emotional impact is there, so maybe he's not the asshole, but there's room for improvement in how he handled it.\n"
