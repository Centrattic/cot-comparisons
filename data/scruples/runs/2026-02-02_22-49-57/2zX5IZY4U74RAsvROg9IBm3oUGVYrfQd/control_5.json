I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. Hmm.\n\nThe situation is that neither the author nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them on big holidays. Her dad died a few months ago, and now she asked him to go to church with her on Easter, which she used to do every year. He declined because he doesn't believe in religion and doesn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight about traditions, and he's asking if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider his perspective. He's not religious and doesn't see the point of church. He said they don't need to go since she's not really religious either. But she might be clinging to traditions as a way to cope with her grief. Maybe she wanted some comfort in the rituals, even if she's not super religious. He might not realize that the act of going to church is more about her emotional needs than the religion itself.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his beliefs and not forcing himself to participate in something he doesn't believe in. But relationships often require compromise. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up to support her could be important. She might feel he's not being supportive, even if he's trying to be there in other ways. The key is whether his refusal was dismissive of her emotional needs.\n\nHe did say he's there for her, but maybe this is a situation where showing up in person, even for a symbolic reason, would have meant a lot. If she's not going herself, why is she asking him to go with her? Maybe she's conflicted and wants to honor her dad's memory or her family's tradition. Even if she's not religious now, the tradition might have sentimental value.\n\nHe might not see the value, but in a relationship, sometimes you do things for each other not because you believe in them, but because you care. His refusal could come off as not valuing her traditions or not supporting her through her grief. Even if he doesn't agree, attending the church service might be a small act of solidarity that would mean a lot to her.\n\nHowever, if he's not willing to compromise at all, that could lead to more issues. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. It's possible he isn't, because he's honest about his beliefs. But maybe he should have found a middle ground, like attending part of the service or explaining his reasons more sensitively. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings and that she felt he wasn't supportive. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the balance between respecting his beliefs and showing support. If he's not willing to make an exception for her, even symbolically, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional significance of her request beyond the religious aspect.\n"
