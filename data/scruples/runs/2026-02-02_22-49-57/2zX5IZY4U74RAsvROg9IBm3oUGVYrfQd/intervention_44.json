I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author isn't religious, and their girlfriend isn't either except for big holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now, after her dad's death, she asked him to go to Easter church with her, but he refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through the service. They fought about it, and he's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's stance is about personal beliefs and not wanting to participate in something he's not comfortable with. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have wanted the support, especially during a difficult time. The key points here are respect for each other's beliefs, communication, and emotional support.\n\nThe author did express willingness to support her but drew a line at church. But maybe he could have found a middle ground, like attending a different service or finding another way to show support. The fact that she was crying and sulking suggests she felt hurt or rejected. Even if he isn't religious, supporting her in her needs might require some compromise. So, while his reasons are valid, the way he handled it might have been insensitive. It's about empathy and understanding her emotional state during a grieving time. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not considering her emotional needs more deeply, even if his refusal is based on personal beliefs.\n"
