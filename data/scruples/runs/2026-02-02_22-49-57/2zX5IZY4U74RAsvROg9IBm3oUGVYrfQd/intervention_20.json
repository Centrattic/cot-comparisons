I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious, but her family is. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter, which was a tradition, but he declined because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, and he's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's dad died recently, so this is a sensitive time. She's trying to cope, and church might be a way for her to connect with her family's traditions. The author is trying to be supportive but refused to go to church, which she found hurtful. \n\nHe argues that they're both not religious, so why go. But she might be using the church attendance as a way to honor her dad's memory, even if she's not super religious. The problem is that he dismissed her feelings by saying they don't need to go since she's not religious, which might have invalidated her needs during this time.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. On one hand, he's being honest about his beliefs and not forcing himself to do something he's uncomfortable with. On the other hand, in a supportive relationship, sometimes you do things for the other person's emotional well-being, even if it's not your thing. \n\nBut the user says the author is not in the wrong. But maybe the issue is that he didn't consider her emotional needs enough. Even if she's not religious, the act of going together might be more about her family's tradition and her processing the grief. By refusing, he might be missing a chance to support her in her way.\n\nAlso, she mentioned she can't fly home, so maybe she wanted the presence of her partner to feel supported. The author's refusal could be seen as not being fully supportive. Even if he doesn't believe in the religion, showing up could be a symbolic gesture of being there for her. \n\nSo maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her emotional needs and the symbolic importance of the tradition during her time of grief. Even if they aren't religious, supporting her by attending might be more important than his own discomfort. The key is that in a relationship, sometimes you have to do things that aren't your preference to support your partner.\n"
