I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died, specifically on Easter. The author isn't religious and their girlfriend isn't either, though her family is very religious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is being honest about their beliefs and isn't pretending to be religious. They said they don't want to sit through the service and don't believe in it. On the other hand, the girlfriend might value traditions and family expectations, especially during a time of grief. She might see going to church as important for her emotional support or family bonding.\n\nThe author did say they are there for her, which shows they care. However, saying \"we don't even need to go now\" might have dismissed her feelings. Maybe the girlfriend wanted to go for her own reasons, not just the family's. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in her way of coping.\n\nBut the author also mentioned that the girlfriend said she doesn't really want to go. If that's true, maybe the author's initial refusal was in line with her own feelings, but the way it was communicated might have caused conflict. The key here is whether the author respected her process without imposing their own views.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might have been trying to honor her dad's memory through the tradition. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting that. But the author is also being genuine about their beliefs. It's a balance between respecting each other's values.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author didn't compromise here, which might have caused hurt. Even if they don't believe in it, showing up for her might have been a way to support her emotionally, regardless of the activity. But the author might feel that going to church isn't genuine for them.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's refusal was considerate. If they communicated clearly and she still didn't want to go, maybe they're not wrong. But if the author dismissed her need to go, even if she's not religious, then they might be in the wrong. The fact that the girlfriend was crying suggests she felt hurt, which the author might need to address even if they don't share the same beliefs.\n"
