I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The question is whether they should have gone despite not being religious.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple isn't very religious. The girlfriend goes sometimes, mainly for big holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Now, her dad died recently, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter, which she did every year with her family. He refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He said they don't need to go since she's not that religious. This caused a fight, and she's upset. He feels bad but doesn't see the point of going, and she even said she doesn't want to go anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are about respect, support during grief, and personal beliefs. The girlfriend might be using the church as a way to connect with her family's traditions or find comfort after her dad's death. Even if she's not religious, the tradition might be important to her emotionally. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in her time of need, which could be hurtful. On the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to fake it. But in relationships, sometimes you have to make compromises. If the girlfriend is struggling and the church visit is her way of coping, not going might seem like not being there for her, even if he doesn't believe in it. However, if she's not insisting anymore and even says she doesn't want to go, maybe there's a shift in her feelings. \n\nBut the key is that she asked him to go, perhaps expecting him to support her in her tradition. Refusing could be seen as dismissive of her needs during a tough time. Even if he's not religious, showing up to support her might be important for her emotional well-being. The fact that she's upset and there was a big fight suggests that this is a sensitive issue. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on how one views the balance between personal beliefs and supporting a partner's emotional needs. If the author's refusal was based on his own beliefs but caused her emotional distress, maybe he's not wrong in terms of honesty, but he might have failed to consider her emotional needs. However, if she's not actually religious and doesn't want to go, maybe his refusal is justified. Wait, she said she doesn't really want to go either. So maybe she was conflicted, trying to honor her family's tradition but not wanting to go herself. The author's refusal might be in line with her actual feelings, but she might have wanted him to go regardless. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. If she's not religious and doesn't want to go, then maybe the author is correct in not wanting to go. But if she's using the church as a way to cope with her dad's death, even if she's not religious, the author not going could be seen as not supporting her. The question is whether supporting her emotional needs overrides his own beliefs. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If she's in a vulnerable state, supporting her might be more important than sticking to his beliefs. Even if he doesn't believe in it, showing up to support her could be more important. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for not going despite her request. However, if she's not really religious and doesn't want to go, then he's not in the wrong. The problem is the conflict arises because she might have had mixed feelings. \n\nLooking at the scenario again: she asked him to go, implying she wants him to support her in this tradition. Even if she's not religious, she might feel that going is important for her to honor her dad or her family. The author's refusal might have caused her emotional pain, which could make him wrong. But if she's honest about not wanting to go, then maybe he's right. The key is that she went with her family every year before, and now she can't fly home, so she's asking him to go as a substitute. That might be a significant request. \n\nIn conclusion, even if he's not religious, showing up to support her in this tradition could be considered the right thing to do. If he refused and it caused her distress, he might be in the wrong. However, if she's not actually religious and doesn't want to go, then he's not wrong. But the fact that she's the one who asked him to go suggests she wanted to do it for some reason, maybe for closure or to honor her dad. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her in her emotional needs.\n"
