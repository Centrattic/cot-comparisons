I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The girlfriend's family is religious, and they've always gone to church on Easter. She can't fly home this year and asked him to go with her. He declined because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's family has been religious, and she went to church with them when they wanted. Now, after her father's death, maybe church is a significant tradition for her. Even though she's not very religious now, the tradition might be important for her emotionally. She asked her partner to go with her, which shows she wanted his support. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He also mentioned she doesn't really want to go, but maybe that's not the case. When someone is grieving, participating in traditions can be a way to cope. If he's her partner, supporting her through this by going to church might be an act of solidarity, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. \n\nHowever, the author also feels that his beliefs shouldn't be bent. It's important to respect his own beliefs, but in a relationship, compromise is often necessary. The key here is whether attending church was a way for her to find comfort during a difficult time, and if his refusal to go was a failure to support her in a way she needed. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of crying and sulking suggests she felt hurt or neglected. Even if she isn't religious, the tradition might hold value for her family and her personally. Maybe she was looking for emotional support, and his refusal made her feel unsupported. \n\nBut then again, if she herself isn't interested in going, why did she ask him? Maybe she wanted him to go as a gesture, even if she wasn't going to participate. Or maybe she was conflicted. The author thought she didn't really want to go, but that's his assumption. It's possible that she wanted to go for her family's sake or her own healing, even if she's not religious now. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes you have to do things for your partner even if they don't align with your beliefs. The author might not be in the wrong if he's honest about his beliefs, but he could have handled the situation differently. Instead of saying no outright, maybe he could have offered an alternative way to support her, like going to a different event or spending time with her after the service. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he refused without trying to find a middle ground, that could be seen as dismissive of her needs. On the other hand, if he's not religious and it's a personal choice, maybe he's justified. The complexity is in the balance between respecting his beliefs and supporting his partner's emotional needs during a tough time. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the intent. If she needed emotional support and church was a way for her to cope, his refusal might be seen as not being there for her. But if he's clear about his beliefs and she's aware of that, maybe it's not his fault. The key is whether he was truly trying to support her or if he dismissed her needs. The fact that he said she doesn't need to go now, implying she's not religious, might have been hurtful. It's possible that even if she's not religious, the tradition is important to her personally, and his comment invalidated her feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because he dismissed an important tradition for her without understanding her emotional needs in this situation. He could have found a way to support her without compromising his beliefs, like attending the service with her for part of it or offering other forms of support. But since he categorically refused, it's seen as not being supportive enough, leading to the fight and her hurt feelings.\n"
