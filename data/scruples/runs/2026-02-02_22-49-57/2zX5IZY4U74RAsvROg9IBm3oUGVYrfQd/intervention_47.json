I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend aren't very religious. The author isn't religious at all, while the girlfriend goes to church occasionally, mainly for big holidays. Her family is very religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted her to. Her dad passed away a few months ago, and she's been dealing with that. She asked the author to go to church with her on Easter because it was a tradition her family followed every year. The author refused because they don't want to sit through the service and don't believe in religion. They also mentioned that since she isn't super religious either, maybe they don't need to go. This led to an argument, and now the gf is upset. The author feels bad but doesn't see the point in going. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the key points. The situation is about respecting traditions and supporting someone during a grieving period. The author's girlfriend is trying to maintain a family tradition, even if she's not super religious now. The author refused, maybe not considering the emotional significance for her. Even though the author isn't religious, supporting the partner in a meaningful tradition might be important. The author said she doesn't want to go either, but maybe she does want to for her dad's memory. By refusing, the author might have dismissed her emotional needs. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't support her in this. But the user's perspective is that the author isn't wrong because they're being honest about their beliefs. However, in relationships, sometimes compromise is needed. So, maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. The author didn't go with her, but she was the one who asked. If the author had gone, that would have shown support even if they don't believe. But if the author had agreed to go but didn't believe, maybe that's insincere. However, the girlfriend might need that gesture. So, maybe the author's refusal was a mistake. I think the answer could be A. But I need to be sure. The key is whether refusing to accommodate a partner's emotional needs, even if they aren't religious, is wrong. The author's reasoning is about their own beliefs, but maybe they should have considered the symbolic importance for her. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
