I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. They aren't very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition for her and her family. The author refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He also mentioned that she's not really religious anymore, so he thought they didn't need to go. It caused a big fight.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respecting each other's needs during a difficult time. The girlfriend is dealing with grief and maybe finding comfort in traditions. Even if they aren't religious, showing up for her might be important for her emotionally. The author might see it as a personal choice, but in a relationship, supporting each other's emotional needs is crucial. \n\nBut wait, the author did try to be supportive and said he wants to be there. Maybe he thought she didn't really want to go either. But she asked him to go with her, which might mean she needed the support, even if she wasn't religious. Refusing could be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs during a tough time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to participate in something he doesn't believe in. That's valid too. But maybe there's a middle ground, like going to show support without participating actively. However, he refused outright. So, is it wrong to not compromise here?\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend is using the tradition as a way to cope with her dad's death, not attending could hurt her feelings and show a lack of support. Even if they aren't religious, being present for her might be more important. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her emotional needs as much as his own beliefs. But then again, he's honest about his stance. It's a bit of a tricky balance. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A, yes, he's in the wrong. Because in a relationship, supporting each other through grief and traditions, even if they're not your own, is important. His refusal might have dismissed her feelings and her need for tradition during a hard time. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up could have meant a lot to her. So maybe he should have gone to support her, even if he didn't participate actively.\n"
