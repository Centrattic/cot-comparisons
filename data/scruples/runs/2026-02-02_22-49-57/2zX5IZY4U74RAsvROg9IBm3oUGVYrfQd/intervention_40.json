I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author's main points are that neither they nor their girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church sometimes, like on Christmas and Easter. Her dad passed away recently, and she wanted the author to go to church with her on Easter because it's a tradition for her family. The author refused because they aren't religious and didn't want to sit through the service. This led to a fight, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key factors here are respect, empathy, and compromise. The author claims they want to be there for the girlfriend but drew a line at going to church. The girlfriend, who isn't extremely religious herself, still felt it was important for this specific reason\u2014her dad's death and the family tradition.\n\nEven though the author isn't religious, supporting a partner during a time of grief might require some flexibility. The girlfriend might see attending the service as a way to honor her father and find comfort in tradition, especially without being able to return home. The author's refusal could be seen as not fully supporting her emotional needs, despite their own beliefs. \n\nHowever, the author's stance is about their own discomfort and lack of belief. They might feel that attending would be hypocritical or that they wouldn't be able to genuinely participate. The question is whether empathy and support should override personal beliefs in this context. \n\nIt's also important to note that the author did try to reason with her, saying that since she's not that religious, going isn't necessary. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the tradition still holds significance for her, even if she's not deeply religious. The author might not have considered the symbolic importance of the gesture for her.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for sticking to their beliefs, they might be in the wrong for not recognizing the importance of the gesture to the girlfriend during a vulnerable time. Relationships often require balancing personal beliefs with the needs of the partner. In this case, attending the service could be a way to show solidarity and support, even if it's not a personal belief. The fight that ensued suggests a breakdown in communication about the significance of the request. Therefore, the author's refusal might be seen as a failure to fully support the girlfriend's emotional needs, making them at fault.\n"
