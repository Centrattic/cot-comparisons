I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the person is wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The main points are their lack of religiousness and the girlfriend's family being very religious.\n\nFirst, the author isn't religious at all, and their girlfriend only goes for big holidays. But her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now, after her dad's death, she wants to go to Easter church. The author refuses, saying they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, crying, and there's a big fight.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, respecting someone's wishes in a relationship is important. Even if the author isn't religious, the girlfriend might see this as a way to honor her father and family traditions. The author might not see the value, but the fact that the girlfriend is trying to hold onto that tradition after loss is significant. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her emotional needs. However, the author also mentioned that the girlfriend said she doesn't really want to go, which might complicate things. But even if she doesn't want to go, she asked him to go with her, perhaps to have his support. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel their beliefs shouldn't be bent. But in relationships, compromise is key. If the girlfriend is upset, maybe the author should have found a way to accommodate, even if it's hard for them. The fact that it turned into a big fight and she's upset suggests that the author's refusal hurt her feelings. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider her emotional needs as much as their own discomfort. But then again, if the girlfriend doesn't really want to go, why the fight? There's some inconsistency there. Maybe she wanted to go for her family's sake, even if she's not religious. The author might not have realized the importance of that gesture for her. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (author is wrong) because supporting a partner's emotional needs, especially after a loss, is crucial. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up for her could have been a way to show support, regardless of personal beliefs. The fact that she's upset and it's a tradition she values, despite her current lack of religiosity, suggests that the author's refusal was hurtful and not supportive.\n"
