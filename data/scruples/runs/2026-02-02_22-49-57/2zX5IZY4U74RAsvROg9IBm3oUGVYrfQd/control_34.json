I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious. The girlfriend goes sometimes, especially for big holidays, but her family is religious. Her dad passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, which she did every year with her family. She asked the guy to go with her, but he declined because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He argued that she's not that religious either, so they don't need to go. This led to a big fight.\n\nSo the question is, is he wrong for refusing? Let's break this down. First, the girlfriend's request was to accompany her to church as a gesture of support after her loss. Even if she's not super religious, the act of going together might be important for her emotionally. The guy's refusal is based on his own beliefs, but the key here is the impact on the relationship. \n\nHe says she even told him she doesn't want to go, but maybe she feels that doing so is a way to honor her dad. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that this was a significant request for her. The guy's stance is about his own comfort and beliefs, but in a relationship, sometimes supporting each other through important personal or family matters is necessary. \n\nHowever, the guy also has the right to his own beliefs. But if she's making a specific emotional request, and he's refusing it, that could be seen as dismissing her feelings. The fact that her family is religious and her dad's death is a big deal might mean that this church visit is a way for her to process grief in her own way. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, it's about empathy and support. Even if he doesn't believe in the religion, showing up for her could be a way to show solidarity. The fact that he said they don't need to go because she's not religious might have invalidated her feelings. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong. But I need to consider if there's a point where personal boundaries are okay. But in this case, she was asking for support, and he refused, leading to a fight. So perhaps the answer is A.\n"
