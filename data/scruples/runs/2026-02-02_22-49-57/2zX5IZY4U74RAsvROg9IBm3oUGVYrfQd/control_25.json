I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that neither they nor their girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them, especially on holidays. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. She asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, even though they can't fly home. The author refused because they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. They said they don't need to go since she's not that religious now. This caused a fight.\n\nSo, the main points are: the girlfriend is dealing with grief, asked for support, and the author refused a specific request. The author argues that they're not religious and the girlfriend isn't either. But the girlfriend might see this as a tradition important for her healing. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. Factors to consider: the girlfriend's emotional state, the importance of the tradition to her family and her healing, and the author's refusal despite her request. The author says they want to be supportive but refused when asked. The girlfriend even said she doesn't want to go, which complicates things. If she's conflicted but asked him to go, maybe she wanted him there for support. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her in her time of need, even if the activity isn't important to him. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to their beliefs and might not feel comfortable participating. However, in a relationship, sometimes partners need to compromise, especially when it's about supporting each other through difficult times. The author's refusal could be seen as not prioritizing the girlfriend's emotional needs. The fact that it turned into a fight suggests that the girlfriend felt hurt or unsupported. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't support their partner's request during a difficult time, even if their reasons are valid. But there's also a case for B if one thinks that the author is respecting their own beliefs and the girlfriend isn't actually religious. However, the context is about her father's death, and traditions can be important in grieving, so the author's refusal might be seen as not providing the support she needed.\n"
