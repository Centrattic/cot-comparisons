I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, the context: Neither the person nor their girlfriend is very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church with them on big holidays. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter, which was a tradition. He refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, crying and sulking.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for refusing. Let's consider different angles. On one hand, respecting her wishes and emotional needs is important in a relationship. If she asked him to go, maybe she felt that the tradition was important for her healing or connection to her family. Refusing might have hurt her feelings, especially during a time of grief. On the other hand, he's honest about his beliefs and not pretending to be something he's not. He thought she didn't really want to go either, so maybe he thought it was a waste of time.\n\nBut here's the thing: when someone is grieving, they might need support in different ways. Even if the church isn't his thing, showing up might be a way to support her, even if he doesn't participate. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests it was important to her. He might have not considered that the act of being there, even if he doesn't believe, is what she needed. It's possible he prioritized his own comfort over her emotional needs in that moment.\n\nHowever, he's not wrong for being honest about his beliefs. But in relationships, compromise is key. Maybe he could have found a middle ground, like going but not participating fully, or explaining his stance better. The key point is whether he should have made an exception for her sake. If she asked and it was important to her, even if it's not to him, supporting her through that might be necessary. So, while he's not necessarily wrong in his beliefs, the way he handled it might have been wrong because he didn't consider her feelings enough. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the fact that she said she doesn't want to go either mitigates it? But she still asked him to go. It's possible she wanted to honor her traditions, even if she wasn't fully into it. So, he might have misjudged her needs. Yeah, I think A is the answer here. He should have gone to support her, even if it wasn't his thing.\n"
