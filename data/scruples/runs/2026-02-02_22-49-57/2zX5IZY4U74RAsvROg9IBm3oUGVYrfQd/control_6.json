I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that they're not very religious. The girl goes to church occasionally, like Christmas and Easter, but her family is religious. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with him. The author refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. Now they're fighting.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respecting each other's beliefs and traditions, especially during a time of grief. The author argues that since neither of them is religious, there's no need to go. But the girlfriend wanted to honor her family's tradition and her dad's memory. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time, even if it's not his belief system. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't respecting her family's customs or her emotional needs. Even if he's not religious, showing up for her could be a way to offer support. The fact that she said she doesn't want to go either complicates things, but maybe she still felt the need to attend for her family's sake. The author's stance is about his beliefs, but in this context, it's about supporting her through her grief. \n\nHowever, the author isn't being asked to convert or adopt her beliefs, just to attend a service. It's a matter of showing empathy and support, not necessarily agreeing with the religion. So maybe the author is wrong because he didn't consider her emotional needs over his own discomfort. But if he truly refuses to participate in something he doesn't believe in, maybe he's not in the wrong either. It's a bit of a gray area. But generally, in such situations, being there for the partner despite personal differences is valued. So leaning towards A, he's in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The girlfriend's crying and the fight suggest that his refusal hurt her feelings. Even if he's truthful about his beliefs, the way he handled it might not be supportive enough.\n"
