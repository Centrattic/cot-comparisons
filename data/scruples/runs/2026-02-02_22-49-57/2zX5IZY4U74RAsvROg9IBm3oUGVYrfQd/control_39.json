I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple isn't very religious. The girlfriend goes to church occasionally, mainly for big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them more often. Now her dad has passed, and she's trying to cope. On Easter, she asked him to go to church with her because it was a tradition they had every year. He declined because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. This led to a fight and her being upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend is dealing with grief, the church attendance was a family tradition, and the author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time. Even though he says she doesn't really want to go, maybe she does need the emotional support. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. On one hand, he's honest about his beliefs and feelings. On the other hand, she might be seeking comfort in the tradition, especially without her dad. His refusal could be perceived as not respecting her needs or her family's traditions. Even if they aren't religious, showing up could be a gesture of support for her, not necessarily for the religious aspect. \n\nHe might not see the point because he's not into it, but she might need the emotional support. Also, the fight suggests that communication was an issue. Maybe he could have found a middle ground, like attending part of the service or explaining his stance more carefully to avoid hurt feelings. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other through grief is important. The fact that she's crying and sulking shows how hurt she is. Even if he's being honest, the impact on her is significant. So, while he's not necessarily in the wrong because of his beliefs, not considering her emotional needs might be where he went wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
