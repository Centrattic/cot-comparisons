I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't go to church with their girlfriend after her dad's death is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the context: Both are not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church with them on big holidays. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's still dealing with grief. She asked the guy to go to church with her on Easter, which was important to her family. He refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend was upset, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, the main points. The guy says he's there for her but refused a specific request. He argues that she doesn't really want to go either. The girlfriend might feel that he's not supporting her during her time of need, especially since the church service was a tradition for her family. Even if she's not super religious, the tradition might be about connecting with her family or finding comfort in routine after her father's death.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy isn't religious and might feel uncomfortable or see it as a waste of time. But in a relationship, respecting each other's needs and traditions can be important. If she wanted to go for emotional support or to honor her father, supporting her could be seen as respectful, even if it goes against his beliefs. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend herself said she doesn't really want to go. So maybe she's conflicted. But she asked him to go anyway, perhaps to have someone with her or to honor her father. The guy's refusal might not be the main issue but the way he dismissed her request without considering her emotional state. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. If the girlfriend felt that attending church was important for her healing, not going could be seen as not supporting her. But if she's not into it and he's honest about his beliefs, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The key might be communication. He could have explained his feelings better and found a compromise, like going for a part of the service or doing something else supportive. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes you have to do things the other person wants for their emotional well-being, even if it's not your cup of tea. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't support her in a way that was important to her during a difficult time. But if she didn't actually want to go, maybe B. However, the fact that she asked him to go suggests that she felt it was important, and his refusal might have hurt her feelings. So leaning towards A.\n"
