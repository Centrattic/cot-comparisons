Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor his girlfriend is very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them, but she's not super religious now. Her dad recently died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, but the author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. They fought about it, and the girlfriend is upset. The author is wondering if he's wrong for not going.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are the girlfriend's emotional state after her father's death, her request to attend church as part of tradition, and the author's refusal based on his beliefs. \n\nFirst, the author claims they are both not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church with them when they wanted her to. Now, she's trying to process her grief, and the church service might be a way for her to find comfort or connect with her family's traditions during this time. Even if she says she doesn't want to go, maybe she's conflicted between her feelings and family expectations.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on his own beliefs and discomfort with the service. But in a relationship, especially during a partner's time of grief, there's often an expectation of support, even if it means doing something outside one's comfort zone. The girlfriend might have felt that attending church was a way to honor her father's memory or to find solace in the community. By refusing, the author might have made her feel unsupported, even if he thinks his reasons are valid.\n\nBut then again, the author is also being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to pretend to participate in something he doesn't believe in. There's a balance between supporting a partner and maintaining one's own values. The girlfriend's statement that she doesn't really want to go complicates things. If she's not even sure she wants to go, maybe the issue is more about the principle of traditions rather than the actual act of going. The fight could have stemmed from deeper issues about respecting each other's beliefs and the pressure to conform.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author knew attending church would be important for her emotionally, even if she's not religious, maybe he should have considered her feelings. However, if she's ambivalent and the author's refusal is based on genuine beliefs, it's a matter of mutual understanding. The key here is communication. If the author didn't realize the significance of the church visit for her and didn't offer alternative ways to support her, he might be in the wrong. But if they had discussed it and she was okay with other forms of support, then maybe not. However, given that it led to a fight and she's upset, it's possible the author didn't fully grasp the emotional weight she placed on attending church, making him at least partially wrong.\n"
