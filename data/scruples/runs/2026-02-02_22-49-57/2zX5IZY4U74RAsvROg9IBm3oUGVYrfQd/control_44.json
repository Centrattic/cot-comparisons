I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're not very religious, and neither is the girlfriend, except for holidays. Her family is religious, and she went with them before. Her dad died a few months ago, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, but the author refused.\n\nHmm, the main points here are about respecting traditions and supporting someone during a tough time. The girlfriend might see going to church as important for her emotional support or tradition. The author says they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. But even if they don't believe, maybe showing up would be a gesture of support, regardless of the beliefs.\n\nThe girlfriend mentioned she doesn't really want to go either, but still asked him to come. That's confusing. Maybe she just wanted him to be there for moral support, not necessarily to participate in the service. The author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs, even if they don't share the beliefs. On the other hand, the author is honest about their beliefs and doesn't want to pretend. But maybe in this context, making an exception could help the relationship. It's a balance between respecting each other's beliefs and supporting the partner during grief.\n"
