I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, neither the author nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend goes to church occasionally, like on Christmas and Easter, but her family is more religious. She used to go with them when they wanted her to. Now her dad died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with the author. The author refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. He told her they don't need to go since she's not that religious. They had a big fight about traditions, and she's upset.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's emotional state and the importance of the tradition. Her dad's death is a sensitive time, and Easter is a significant holiday for her family. Even though she's not super religious now, the tradition might have emotional significance for her, especially during a time of grief. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her emotionally. \n\nHowever, the author is also honest about his beliefs and isn't forcing himself to pretend to believe something. But in a relationship, sometimes showing support through actions (like attending a service even if you don't believe) can be important for the partner. The author might not be wrong, but maybe he could have found a middle ground. Maybe attending part of the service or acknowledging the importance of the tradition without fully participating. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend is upset because she asked him to go, perhaps expecting emotional support rather than religious participation. The author's refusal might have been seen as dismissing her feelings or the importance of the tradition to her family. So, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for not considering her emotional needs during this time, even if his reasons are valid. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend isn't even going herself but still asked him to, that's a bit confusing. But she might have wanted to honor her father's memory. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her wishes, especially since she's trying to cope with her loss. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because he's being honest about his beliefs. However, in relationships, sometimes you have to make compromises. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
