I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They're both not very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to church on Easter, but he refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is about respecting her feelings and traditions. The author says they're not religious and don't see the point. The girlfriend did go with her family in the past, but now she can't fly home. She asked him to go, which he refused. He argued that she's not that religious, but she said she doesn't want to go either. So why is she asking him to go if she's not really into it?\n\nHmm. The author might be missing the emotional aspect here. Even if they're not religious, church might be a place for her to find comfort or connect with family during a grieving time. By refusing, he might be dismissing her emotional needs. He says he's there for her, but this action might not align with supporting her. Also, the fact that she's crying and sulking suggests it's really important to her. Even if she said she doesn't want to go, she might still want him to go to honor her family's traditions. \n\nBut wait, maybe she's using the tradition as a way to cope, even if she's not religious. The author's refusal could be seen as not being supportive. On the other hand, he's being honest about his beliefs and not being forced to go. However, in a relationship, sometimes compromising is necessary, especially around significant events for the partner. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not being supportive when she's grieving, even if he's not religious, then maybe he is wrong. But if he's being honest about his beliefs and she's not really into it either, maybe he's not. But the fact that she's crying and it's a big fight suggests that he didn't consider her emotional needs. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't support her emotional needs during a difficult time, even if he's not religious.\n"
