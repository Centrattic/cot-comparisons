I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is about a couple where neither is very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them, especially on big holidays. Her dad recently passed away, and she wanted to go to Easter church with him this year. The author refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, crying, and sulking. The author is feeling bad but doesn't see the point of going since she's not super religious now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's not religious, doesn't want to pretend, and his partner isn't that religious either. He's trying to be supportive in his own way. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see church as a way to cope with her loss and honor her family's traditions. Her being upset suggests that this is important to her, even if she's not a regular churchgoer anymore.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting each other's beliefs and the importance of the ritual for her. The author is being honest about his beliefs, which is valid, but maybe he's not considering how important this tradition is for her emotional healing. Even if he's not religious, sometimes supporting a partner in their personal rituals can show empathy and support. His refusal might come off as dismissive of her needs during a difficult time.\n\nBut then again, if the author isn't comfortable, forcing himself to go might not be genuine support. However, maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have asked how she felt about him joining, or suggested an alternative way to support her. The fact that she said she doesn't really want to go complicates things. If she's conflicted, maybe his refusal could be seen as not respecting her wishes, even if she's not in agreement with it.\n\nAlso, in a relationship, sometimes compromise is necessary. If the girlfriend is struggling, the author might need to bend a bit to help her through it, even if it's not his personal belief system. But if he's not willing to do that, it might indicate a deeper issue in the relationship. The author's reasoning is that he's being honest, but maybe he's not showing enough empathy towards her emotional needs right now.\n"
