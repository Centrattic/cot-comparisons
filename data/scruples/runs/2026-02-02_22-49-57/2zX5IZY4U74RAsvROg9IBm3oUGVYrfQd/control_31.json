I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The user wants to know if he's the asshole for not going.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's dad recently died, and her family is religious. They usually go to church on Easter. She's not super religious herself but goes for holidays. Now, she can't fly home for Easter and asked him to go with her. He refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight about it, she's upset, and he's questioning if he did the wrong thing.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are about respecting her needs and traditions during a time of grief. Even if he's not religious, showing support can be important in a relationship. She might be using the church as a way to connect with her family's traditions or find comfort. By not going, he might be denying her that support. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's not religious and feels it's not necessary. He said she doesn't really want to go either. But maybe she does want to go because it's part of her coping mechanism, even if she's not religious. Also, the fact that they had a big fight suggests that this is a bigger issue than just the church service. Maybe there's some underlying tension about traditions or expectations in the relationship.\n\nIs he wrong for not bending his beliefs? Well, he has the right to his beliefs, but relationships often require compromise. If she's struggling and needs him to be there for her, even if it's a tradition he doesn't personally believe in, is it selfish to not go? It might be about how much he's willing to support her through her grief, regardless of his own feelings.\n\nBut she did say she doesn't really want to go. Wait, she asked him to go, but then said she doesn't really want to go. That's confusing. Maybe she wanted him to go for her family's sake or to connect with her tradition, even if she's not into it. Or maybe she's conflicted herself. But if she's not going to go, why ask him to? Maybe she's trying to honor her dad's memory through the tradition, even if she's not religious anymore.\n\nHe might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her emotional needs during a difficult time. Even if he's not religious, showing up to support her could be crucial. Relationships require compromise. If she's upset and they had a big fight over it, maybe he should have made an exception. \n\nBut again, he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through a service. Maybe there's another way he could have supported her without going to church. Like staying home and being there for her, or finding another way to honor her dad. But she specifically asked to go to church, so maybe that's her way of processing the grief. \n\nI think the answer is A, he is in the wrong. Even if he's not religious, supporting her through her grief and respecting her traditions during such a time is important. Refusing might have been seen as not being there for her when she needed him, even if it's a tradition he doesn't personally believe in. The fact that she's upset and they had a fight suggests that his refusal was hurtful and perhaps not considering her emotional state.\n"
