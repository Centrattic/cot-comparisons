I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author explains that neither they nor their girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is more religious, but she only attends services occasionally. Her dad recently passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition. The author refused because they don't believe in religion and don't want to attend the service. They had a big fight about it, and now the girlfriend is upset.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong and is curious about my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is not religious, and the girlfriend isn't either, only attending occasionally. The girlfriend's family is religious, so maybe this tradition is important to them. However, the author's refusal was based on their personal beliefs. The girlfriend said she doesn't really want to go either, which might indicate that the request was more about the tradition or her coping with grief rather than a genuine desire to attend.\n\nThe author tried to be supportive but drew a line at participating in a religious activity they don't believe in. It's a matter of personal boundaries. The girlfriend might be using the church as a way to connect with her family's traditions during a difficult time. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in her way of grieving. However, the author also mentioned that the girlfriend isn't all that religious, so maybe the author is right in not bending their beliefs. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about being there for her in her time of need, even if it's not in a way the author personally agrees with. The author's support is important, and attending the service might be a small gesture to show solidarity, even if they don't believe in it. On the other hand, the author's honesty about their beliefs is valid. The key is whether the refusal was disrespectful or dismissive. The author did say they want to be there for her until she asked for the church, so perhaps they were being honest about their limits.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they are respecting their own beliefs, but maybe there's a middle ground, like attending part of the service or finding another way to support her. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the author was upfront and the girlfriend admitted she doesn't want to go, the author's refusal is justified. The fight might have been more about the principle than the actual church attendance. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
