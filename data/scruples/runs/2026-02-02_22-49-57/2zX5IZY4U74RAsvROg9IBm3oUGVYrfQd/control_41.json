I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're both not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church sometimes, especially on big holidays. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter because it was a tradition, but he refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight, and now she's upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect, support, and understanding. The author says he's there for her, but refused the church visit. He argues she doesn't even want to go. But maybe she wanted his presence more than the actual service. Grief can make people rely on traditions for comfort. Even if she's not religious, the tradition might be important to her as a way to honor her dad or connect with her family.\n\nThe author might not be wrong in terms of his beliefs, but he might not be considering her emotional needs. Supporting someone in grief isn't just about sharing the same beliefs; it's about being present in the way they need. Refusing without trying to understand her perspective could come off as dismissive. He says she even said she doesn't want to go, which is confusing. Maybe she was conflicted but still wanted to go for her family, and his refusal added to her stress. \n\nIs he wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he respected her wishes and offered alternative support, maybe not. But by refusing the church visit without trying to find a compromise, he might have missed a chance to show solidarity. The answer could depend on cultural expectations and how both parties communicate. But given the situation, the author's refusal might be seen as not fully supporting her during a difficult time, even if he has valid reasons. So, probably A (he's in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Let me check again.\n\nHe said he's there for her \"at least until she asked me to go...\" which implies he stopped being there. That's a red flag. Even if he doesn't agree, showing up could be more important. Also, he told her they don't need to go because she's not religious, which dismisses her own feelings about it. So yeah, A.\n"
