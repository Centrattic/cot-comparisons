I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple isn't very religious. The author isn't religious at all, and the girlfriend only goes to church on special occasions like Christmas and Easter. Her family is more religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Now, her dad died, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to Easter church with her, but he refused. He said he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He mentioned she's not that religious anymore, which led to a fight about traditions. She's upset, crying, and sulking. He feels bad but doesn't see the point of going.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is about supporting her through grief and respecting her wishes. Even if they aren't religious, sometimes people turn to traditions or rituals for comfort after a loss. The girlfriend might be looking for closure or support from her community. By not accompanying her, the author might be dismissing her need for that support. Even if he doesn't believe, being present could be a way to show solidarity. The fact that she asked him to go suggests she wanted him there for emotional support, not necessarily for religious reasons. His refusal, even if based on personal beliefs, might have made her feel unsupported during a hard time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that forcing himself to attend something he doesn't believe in goes against his principles. But in a relationship, compromise is important. If she's not all that religious now, maybe she still values the gesture of going with her. The author's response might have been seen as dismissive of her needs. Also, he said they don't need to go now, which could be insensitive. \n\nI think the key here is about showing support in her way. Even if it's a religious event, his presence could be a sign of care. Refusing might have caused hurt feelings. So, he might be in the wrong for not accommodating her needs, even if it's a tradition he doesn't personally follow.\n"
