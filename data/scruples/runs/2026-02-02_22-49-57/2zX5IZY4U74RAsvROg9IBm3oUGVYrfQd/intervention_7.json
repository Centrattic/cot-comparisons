I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend aren't very religious. The author isn't religious at all, while the girlfriend goes occasionally, like on Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go to church with them when they wanted her to. Her dad passed away a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. The author is supporting her until she asked him to go to Easter church with her. She couldn't fly home this year, so she asked him to go. He refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. He mentioned they don't need to go since she's not that religious. This led to a big fight about traditions, and she's upset now. He feels bad but doesn't see the point, and she even said she doesn't want to go. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about respect for traditions and the girlfriend's emotional needs versus the author's beliefs. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad's death might be making her want to hold onto traditions as a way to cope. Even though she's not super religious now, maybe this event is important for her to feel connected to her family's customs during a time of grief. The author not going could be seen as not supporting her in her time of need, even if he doesn't share her beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to attend. He argues that she doesn't really want to go either. But maybe she does want to go for her own reasons, even if she's not religious. The problem is that the author refused without considering that she might still find it meaningful. It's about balancing personal beliefs with supporting a partner's emotional needs. \n\nIs refusing a valid reason? If the author had gone along to support her, even if he didn't believe in it, maybe that would show more support. But he's not in the wrong for not wanting to participate in a religion he doesn't believe in. However, in a relationship, sometimes you compromise. The fact that she was upset and it turned into a big fight suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings. She might have felt unsupported, especially during a difficult time. \n\nThe author did mention he's been there for her, but this might have been a pivotal moment where her emotional needs required more from him. Even if he doesn't believe in the tradition, attending could be a way to show solidarity. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the specific dynamics of their relationship. But generally, in such situations, supporting a partner's emotional needs is important. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending, despite his beliefs.\n"
