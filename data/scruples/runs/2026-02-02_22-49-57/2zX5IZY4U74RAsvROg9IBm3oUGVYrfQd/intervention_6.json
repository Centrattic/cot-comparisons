I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that they're both not very religious, but her family is religious. She went to church with them before, but now she's asking him to go, and he refuses. They had a big fight about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that they're not religious, don't believe in the religion, and don't want to sit through a service. The girlfriend seems conflicted but asked him to go anyway. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, supporting each other's needs during tough times is important. The girlfriend might see going to church as a way to honor her father's memory or connect with her family's traditions. If she asked him to go, expecting his support, he refusing could hurt her feelings. However, the author also has his own beliefs and comfort level. It's a balance between respecting each other's values.\n\nBut wait, the author said she even mentioned she doesn't really want to go. If that's true, maybe the conflict isn't about her wanting to go but about her needing support in a tradition, even if she's not into it. The author might not realize that showing up could be more about being there for her emotionally than sharing the religious beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is uncomfortable and the girlfriend acknowledges she doesn't want to go either, maybe the fight was about something else. Maybe it's about respect for traditions or feeling unsupported. The author might be right in not wanting to pretend to believe, but maybe the way he refused without compromise could be an issue.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his refusal was considerate. If he dismissed her request without understanding her emotional need, he might be wrong. If he was honest but respectful, maybe not. The key points are communication and empathy. If he refused by stating his beliefs but offered other forms of support, it's different than being dismissive. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests she felt hurt. He might have failed to see the emotional aspect beyond the religious aspect.\n\nSo, maybe answer A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't support her emotionally during a difficult time, even if he doesn't share the beliefs. But others might argue that forcing someone to attend a service against their beliefs isn't fair. Hmm. It's a tough call. The question is whether the author was wrong. If the girlfriend needed emotional support and the author refused to participate in a way that showed support (even if not religious), then yes. If the girlfriend was insistent on a religious tradition that he isn't part of, and she's okay without him, maybe not. The answer hinges on the balance between respecting personal beliefs and supporting a partner in grief.\n"
