I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church sometimes. Her dad died recently, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with her family. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. Now they fought, and she's upset.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are about respecting her family's traditions, being supportive during her time of grief, and the author's own beliefs. The author says he's there for her but refused to go to church. The girlfriend wanted to go, even though she's not super religious. \n\nI think supporting someone in their time of loss involves respecting their needs, which might include traditions. Even if the author isn't religious, going to church could be a way for her to connect with her family and find comfort. By not going, he might be not fully supporting her. But on the other hand, he's not forcing himself to believe anything. However, the fact that she asked him to go suggests that it's important to her, even if she's not religious. So maybe the author should have compromised. \n\nBut wait, the author mentioned that the girlfriend said she doesn't really want to go now. That's conflicting. If she doesn't want to go, why did she ask him? Maybe she's conflicted. He might be correct in thinking she's not really interested, but maybe she still wanted him to go for other reasons. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the fact that her dad just died adds emotional weight. Grief can make people cling to traditions more. The author's refusal might come off as not supporting her through her grief. Even if he's not religious, showing up could be a symbolic gesture of support. \n\nBut the author's argument is that he's respecting her beliefs since she's not that religious. However, the girlfriend's family's traditions are important to her, and she might be trying to honor her father by going. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her family's customs or her personal journey through grief. \n\nI think the main issue here is about empathy and support. Even if the author isn't religious, he could have gone along to show solidarity. The fight suggests that communication broke down. While it's okay to have personal beliefs, in a relationship, sometimes you need to compromise. Since the girlfriend was upset, the author's refusal might have been a mistake. So, probably answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
