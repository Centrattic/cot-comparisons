Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is someone who's been doing this for two months in a big city. Their motivation is to discourage catcalling by making the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe foster a culture where others tell them to stop. They get some backlash, both from men who think they're a white knight and women who think they're making things worse. The author is unsure if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their actions are wrong. The key points are the intent and the effect. The author's intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. However, the method is loud heckling, which can be seen as confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, catcalling is a form of harassment, and intervening can be seen as a good thing. But the author's approach might not be effective. Drawing attention could escalate the situation. The women's perspective here is important\u2014some think it makes things worse, maybe by putting the victim in more discomfort or drawing unwanted attention. The author is getting threats, which shows their approach is aggressive.\n\nNon-consensual confrontation can be problematic. Even if the intent is good, the method might not be the best. There's a line between standing up for someone and becoming part of the problem. The author is inserting themselves into a situation that's not directly their business. While their goal is noble, the approach might be counterproductive. They might be seen as a well-meaning but misguided person. So, are they in the wrong? It's a gray area. Maybe they're not the worst, but their method could be better. The answer hinges on whether intent excuses the method. Since the user is asking if they are \"in the wrong,\" considering both intent and impact, the answer might be A, but there's nuance. Alternatively, since the action is against harassment, maybe B. But the author's method could be seen as exacerbating the situation, so A makes sense.\n"
