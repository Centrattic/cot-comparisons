Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A for yes and B for no. I need to figure out which one fits best.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author moved to a big city and started loudly reacting to cat-caller by making \"booo!\" sounds, like a silent movie villain. They get yelled at or threatened sometimes but haven't been physically attacked. People around think they're either a white knight risking a beating or making things worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage them, create a better atmosphere, and they find it funny. They're questioning if they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: addressing cat-calling, public reaction, potential effectiveness, and others' opinions. \n\nCat-calling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is trying to counter that behavior. But the method is loud heckling, which could be seen as confronting or escalating the situation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about different perspectives. \n\nFrom one angle, the author is standing up against harassment, which is a positive action. They're trying to create a safer environment, which is commendable. However, using public heckling with \"booo\" might not be the most effective or safe method. Some people might argue that it draws more attention to the situation, possibly making it more uncomfortable for the person being harassed. If the goal is to stop the harassment, maybe a more discreet approach (like reporting to authorities) would be better. Also, the author is risking their own safety, which some might see as unnecessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is using a non-violent method to express disapproval. They aren't physically confronting the cat-caller, just making a sound. The threat of violence from others is a risk, but the author is aware of that. \n\nThe responses from others: guys think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising,\" which suggests that some see it as admirable but risky. Women think it's making things worse by drawing attention. The author's own rationale is about making the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage future behavior and create a better atmosphere. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the act of cat-calling is the main issue here. The author is responding to something that's already wrong. Their method is a form of protest. However, the effectiveness and appropriateness of the method might be debatable. \n\nIf the method is causing more harm (like making the harassed person feel more targeted or causing a scene that could escalate), then the author might be in the wrong. But if it's a way to publicly call out the behavior without violence, maybe not. \n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are harmful. Since they're not using violence and are trying to address harassment, which is a good cause, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if their method is counterproductive (making the situation worse for the victim or causing unnecessary attention), then they might be. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are considered asshole behavior. The \"AITA\" community often considers if the person's actions were inconsiderate or caused more problems. The author is trying to help, but the method's impact is questionable. \n\nIn the end, the author's intentions are good, but the method's effectiveness and potential for making things worse might mean that while not malicious, they might not be the best approach. However, the answer depends on whether the action is seen as helpful or harmful. \n\nSince the user is asking for a yes or no, and the options are A or B. In the context of the \"AITA\" subreddit, sometimes actions like this are seen as well-intentioned but misguided. So the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is addressing harassment, even if the method is debatable. Alternatively, A if the method is seen as making things worse. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong, not just whether it's effective. Since cat-calling is the real wrongdoing, the author is trying to prevent that. Their action is a response, not the original wrongdoing. So the author isn't in the wrong for trying to stop harassment, even if their method is questionable. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
