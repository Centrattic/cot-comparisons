Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months in a big city. His method is to loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers like a silent movie villain. He's gotten some cussing and threats but hasn't been physically attacked. Both men and women have different opinions about him. He thinks he's discouraging the cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. But others think he's creating more attention or being a white knight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening seems good, but the method here is public heckling. Is that appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop a negative behavior. He's not physically confronting them, just making a loud noise. That could be seen as a non-violent way to address the issue. Plus, he's getting a reaction from the cat-callers, which might deter them in the future. The author's intention is to create a better environment, which is commendable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's drawing unnecessary attention. The women he interacts with think it's making things worse. By publicly shaming the cat-callers, maybe he's escalating the situation. Also, if the cat-callers respond with threats, could that put others around them at risk? Even though he's a big person, is it his place to step in like that?\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does public heckling actually reduce cat-calling, or just cause embarrassment without changing behavior? Maybe the author should consider more constructive methods, like reporting to authorities or supporting policies against harassment instead of direct confrontation.\n\nAlso, the author's humor about being a \"big fucker\" and finding it funny might trivialize the seriousness of cat-calling. It's possible he's underestimating the potential consequences of his actions, even if no violence has occurred yet.\n\nBut then again, in some contexts, public shaming of harassment can be a form of activism. People might support his efforts to create a safer space. It's a balance between direct action and potential escalation.\n\nThe main point is whether his method is wrong. The question is if he's in the wrong. If his intention is good and his method isn't causing harm beyond his own safety (which he's taking care of), maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if it's creating more harm by escalating situations or not respecting the judgment of others (women's opinions that it's making it worse), then he might be in the wrong.\n\nBut the answer depends on societal norms. In many places, supporting victims and stopping harassment is encouraged. If his method is non-violent and not illegal, then it's hard to say he's wrong. However, if it's counterproductive, maybe he should consider alternatives. The dilemma here is between active intervention and the method used.\n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward, but based on the options given (A or B), I need to decide. The author's actions are a form of civil disobedience or activism, albeit in a public and attention-drawing way. If the goal is to discourage harassment, maybe he's justified. However, if others (especially potential victims) feel it's making things worse, that's a concern.\n\nBut since the question is about being in the wrong, and cat-calling is the initial wrongdoing, the author is trying to correct that. Unless his method is violating laws or causing direct harm, he might not be in the wrong. So I would lean towards B (No, not in the wrong) because he's addressing a harmful behavior, even if the method is debatable. However, he should consider feedback from others and maybe adjust his approach for better effectiveness without causing more harm.\n"
