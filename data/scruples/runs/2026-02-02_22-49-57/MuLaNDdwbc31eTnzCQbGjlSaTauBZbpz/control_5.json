Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds. The author's reasoning is that they want to make cat-calling uncomfortable and discourage it, creating a better atmosphere. But others think they're an asshole, with some saying they're drawing attention and making things worse.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about whether the author's actions are justified. On one hand, cat-calling is a problem, and the author is trying to address it. But is their method appropriate?\n\nWell, public shaming or heckling someone could be seen as a form of confrontation. The author is making a scene, which might escalate the situation. Even if their intention is good, could this approach actually make things worse by causing more conflict? For example, if the cat-caller gets angry and reacts violently, maybe the situation becomes more dangerous. Also, some people might argue that it's not the author's place to police others in public like that, even if it's a bad behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to stand up against harassment. If their actions do deter others from cat-calling, maybe it's effective. But does that justify the method? The author is also a \"fairly big fucker,\" so they might be in a position where they can handle the confrontation better than others. However, others' opinions are split\u2014some see them as a white knight, others as making things worse.\n\nI need to consider if the author is overstepping. The question is whether they are in the wrong. Legally, unless they're inciting violence or something, maybe not. But socially, it's more about norms. Is public heckling a reasonable response?\n\nThere's also the aspect of drawing attention. If the author's actions draw more attention to the situation, maybe it could distract from the victim's experience. The girls think it's making it worse, which is a valid perspective. If the goal is to help the person being harassed, maybe the method isn't helpful. \n\nSo, balancing the intent to stop harassment against the potential negative consequences of their method. The author's approach is confrontational but non-violent. It's a gray area. Some might say it's a form of peaceful protest, others might say it's unproductive and could lead to more conflict.\n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, maybe it's a matter of perspective. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) if their method is seen as counterproductive or harmful, or B (not in the wrong) if their intent is good and they're not causing direct harm. \n\nBut considering that the author is making a scene, which could escalate the situation, and others (especially those affected by cat-calling) think it's making things worse, maybe the answer is A. However, others might argue it's a justified form of intervention. \n\nI'm a bit torn here, but given that the author is using a confrontational method that could potentially escalate the situation and some victims disagree with the approach, perhaps the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, since the author isn't using violence and is trying to stand up against harassment, maybe B. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment, so intervening in some way is seen as positive. But the method of intervention is key. If the author is using public shaming, which is a form of social sanction, that's not illegal. However, if it's causing more harm than good, maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might depend on the effectiveness and the context. Since the author isn't causing direct harm (like physical violence) and is trying to address a problem, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if their approach is counterproductive, then maybe they are. \n\nGiven that the author is not using violence and is trying to create a better environment, even if their method is debatable, maybe the answer is B. But others' opinions suggest it's not effective. Hmm. The question is from the author's perspective, asking if they are in the wrong. So the answer could be A if the method is considered inappropriate, or B if it's seen as a justified intervention. \n\nI think in this case, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because their method of intervention may escalate the situation and is not considered effective by those who are the actual victims. Even though the intent is good, the approach could be counterproductive.\n"
