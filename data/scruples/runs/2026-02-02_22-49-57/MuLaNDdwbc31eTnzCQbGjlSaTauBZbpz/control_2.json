Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-caller. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author moved to a big city and has a pet peeve against cat-calling. They started heckling the cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" noises, similar to a silent movie villain. This has led to some people cussing them and threats, but no actual physical harm. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a culture where others also speak up. However, others think the author is an asshole. Men think they're a white knight who might get hurt, while women believe they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author also admits to finding it funny, which adds a bit of hypocrisy since they mention being a hypocrite.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing behavior. The author is trying to stop this, which is a positive intent. However, their method is to publicly shame the cat-caller by heckling them. Public shaming can be a contentious method because it can escalate the situation. If the author's actions are causing the cat-caller to feel humiliated, that might be seen as a form of retaliation, which could be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to create a safer environment by discouraging harassment. On the other hand, their approach might be counterproductive. For example, if they're drawing attention to the situation, the victim might feel more uncomfortable or embarrassed. The women who think it's making things worse might be pointing out that the victim could feel more targeted or that the heckling could escalate the confrontation, putting everyone at risk.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are a \"fairly big fucker\" and that no one has acted on the threats yet. But this doesn't necessarily justify their actions. Even if they are physically imposing, using public ridicule as a method to address harassment could be seen as overstepping. It's possible that the cat-caller might retaliate in a way that endangers others or the victims. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for setting a precedent. If the author is publicly shaming someone, even if it's a cat-caller, it might encourage others to take matters into their own hands in similar ways, leading to a cycle of public confrontations that could be harmful. \n\nThe author's rationale is based on the idea that making the cat-caller uncomfortable could deter them. However, the effectiveness of this approach is questionable. It's more likely that the cat-caller might feel validated in their behavior if they face a confrontation, or they might simply target others where they won't be noticed. \n\nAdditionally, the author's own admission of hypocrisy (they have a pet peeve about cat-calling but then engage in behavior that could be seen as similar\u2014publicly shaming someone) suggests that they might be acting out of their own discomfort rather than a well-considered strategy. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The intent is good, but the method could be problematic. The key question is whether the author's actions are more harmful than helpful. Drawing attention to the situation might not be the best approach, and it's possible that the author is indeed making things worse by escalating the situation. \n\nThe fact that others (both men and women) see the author as an asshole indicates that their approach is not universally effective. Women, who are the victims of cat-calling, might feel that the author's actions are not helpful and could make them feel more vulnerable. The author's approach might not be the best way to support victims, as it could inadvertently cause more harm by making the environment more hostile.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention to stop harassment is commendable, their method of public heckling could be counterproductive and potentially harmful. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but I need to consider all perspectives carefully."
