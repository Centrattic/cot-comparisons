Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who's been loudly heckling cat-callers by making a \"booo!\" sound like in a silent movie, which has led to some cussing and threats. The author is trying to argue that their actions might help discourage cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators, but others think they're an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unwanted. The author's intention is to stop this behavior by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But is it acceptable to respond to harassment with more public confrontation? On one hand, the author is trying to address a problem, which is commendable. On the other hand, their method might be seen as escalating the situation or drawing more attention to it, which could make the victims feel worse.\n\nAnother angle is the author's physical presence. They mention being a \"fairly big fucker,\" so maybe their confrontational heckling is not leading to physical altercations because others back down. But does that justify their actions? Maybe not. Public shaming can be a gray area. Some people might see it as standing up against harassment, while others might think it's not their place to intervene in that way. Also, if the author's actions lead to more conflict, even if not physically, it could be counterproductive. The cat-callers might get angry or retaliate, which could harm the people they're trying to help.\n\nThe author's friends and others think they're an asshole, with some saying it draws attention and makes things worse. That's a valid concern. If someone is being cat-called, having someone else yell at the perpetrator might make the victim feel embarrassed or targeted. But the author's rationale is about creating a culture where people stop such behavior. It's a balance between direct action and potential unintended consequences.\n\nI should also think about alternative solutions. Maybe the author could be encouraging others to speak up in a less confrontational way, or supporting policies that address harassment more formally. But the question is about the morality of their specific action.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, unless the heckling becomes threatening or involves false accusations, it's probably within free speech. But morally, it's debatable. The author is trying to do good, but the method might be flawed. They might be overstepping by making a spectacle, which could backfire. So, the answer might hinge on whether the ends justify the means. If their approach actually deters harassment without causing harm, it could be justified. But if it's causing more problems, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is a bit split, but since the question is asking if they're in the wrong, and the majority of people they've discussed with think they are, it's possible the answer is A. However, the author's intention is good. But intentions don't always make actions right if the method is harmful. So, leaning towards A, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
