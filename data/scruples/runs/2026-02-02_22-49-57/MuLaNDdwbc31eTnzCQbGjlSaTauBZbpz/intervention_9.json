Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author moved to a big city two months ago and started doing this because they're against catcalling. They use a loud \"booo!\" like in silent movies. They get some aggressive responses but haven't been physically attacked yet. People around them, both men and women, have mixed reactions. Men think they're a white knight and might be provoking conflict, while women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making it uncomfortable for the cat-caller could discourage the behavior and promote a culture where others tell the cat-caller to stop. They also admit they find it funny but are open to the idea that they might be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider what catcalling is. It's unsolicited and often harassing comments directed at people, usually women, in public. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. But the method they're using is heckling, which might escalate the situation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intent and consequence. The author's intention is to discourage harassment, which is good. However, the consequences are that the cat-callers get angry, maybe more confrontational. The women's concern is that drawing attention could make the situation worse for the victim. \n\nPublic shaming can be a form of intervention. But does it work? Some studies suggest that public shaming can be effective in deterring bad behavior, but it can also lead to escalation if the person feels ridiculed. The author is using humor (like a silent movie villain), which might be seen as not taking the issue seriously. The cat-caller's response is hostile, which could make the environment more tense. \n\nAlso, the author is a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they might be physically intimidating. So their intervention could be perceived as a threat rather than a helpful action. If people are just shouting at the cat-caller, it might not address the underlying issue and could potentially make the victim feel like the situation is now a spectacle. \n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. Effective strategies often involve non-confrontational methods to de-escalate, like directly telling the cat-caller to stop or supporting the victim. The author's method is confrontational and might not align with best practices. The women's perspective here is important because they're the ones being targeted. If their reaction is that it's making it worse, that's a valid concern. \n\nBut the author is trying to create a deterrent effect. Maybe in some contexts, it works. However, if it's leading to more aggression from the cat-caller or making the victim uncomfortable, then it's counterproductive. The mixed responses from others also indicate that their approach isn't universally seen as positive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. While their intent is good, the method might be part of the problem. The answer would depend on whether their actions, despite good intentions, are contributing to a more hostile environment or if they're effectively stopping harassment. Since the author is getting hostile responses but not being physically harmed, maybe they're not directly causing harm, but their approach could be seen as unhelpful or even counterproductive. The women's perspective is that it's making things worse, which is a significant factor. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though they're trying to do something positive, the method of heckling with a \"booo!\" might not be appropriate. It could be seen as joining the confrontation rather than supporting the victim in a safe way. Effective bystander intervention usually involves supporting the person being harassed and de-escalating, not adding to the public shaming in a way that might draw more attention or escalate the situation. The author's approach might be well-meaning but could be causing more harm than good based on others' reactions.\n"
