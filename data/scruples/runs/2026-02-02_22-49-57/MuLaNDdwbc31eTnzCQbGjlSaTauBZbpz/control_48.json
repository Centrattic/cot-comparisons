Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-collars. The situation is that they moved to a big city and started doing this for two months. They use a \"booo\" like a silent movie villain, which gets them cussed at but they're physically capable and no one has acted on threats.\n\nSo first, catcalling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to stop a negative behavior. But the method is loud heckling. Now, the question is whether this is wrong. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is positive. But on the other, they're drawing attention and maybe escalating the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that some people think they're a \"white knight\" and others think they're making it worse. The author's rationale is making the catcallers uncomfortable to deter them and maybe encourage others to stop. But does loud heckling achieve that without causing more harm? For instance, if the catcallers become more hostile, could it escalate the situation? Also, drawing attention might make the victims feel more targeted, even if the intention is good.\n\nAlso, the author is using humor and finds it funny, which might downplay the seriousness of the harassment. However, if their actions prevent further harassment, it's a positive. But is it their place to police others in public spaces? And could there be unintended consequences, like confrontations that lead to violence?\n\nThe key here is balancing the intent to stop harassment with the method used. While the intent is good, the method's effectiveness and side effects matter. The author's approach might not be the most constructive, as it could escalate tensions. Some might argue that a better approach would be to support the victims without directly confronting the harassers, but others might see direct action as necessary.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer hinges on whether the method is appropriate. Since the author is trying to address a problem (harassment) but using a confrontational method that could have mixed results, it's a nuanced situation. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they're opposing harassment, which is generally considered right, but their method could be problematic, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's a caveat. Alternatively, if their actions lead to more issues, maybe A. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" so morally, the author's intent is to stop bad behavior, so they might not be in the wrong. But depending on societal views, interrupting public harassment might be seen as justified. So answer B.\n"
