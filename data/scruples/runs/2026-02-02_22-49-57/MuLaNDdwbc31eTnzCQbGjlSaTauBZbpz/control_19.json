Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the person started doing this after moving to a big city, and they get loud boos at the cat-callers. They get some backlash but haven't been physically attacked yet. People around think they're an asshole, with some thinking it makes the situation worse. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's break it down. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the offenders. But public shaming can have mixed effects. On one hand, it might deter the behavior. On the other, it could escalate the situation, making things more confrontational. The author mentions that others think they're making it worse by drawing attention, which could put others in a difficult spot. Also, the author is using a humorous approach, which might not be the best way to handle a serious issue like harassment.\n\nBut then, is it the author's fault? They are trying to stand up against something they disagree with. However, their method might not be the most effective or considerate. Public shaming can sometimes lead to more conflict. The author is aware that people think they're an asshole, which is a sign that their approach might not be well-received. Even if the intent is good, the impact might be negative. For instance, if the cat-caller becomes more aggressive because of the heckling, it could put others at risk. Also, the author's own safety could be a concern if they continue to provoke potential hostile reactions.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of bystander intervention. There are recommended methods for intervening safely, like using non-confrontational approaches or reporting incidents. The author's method is confrontational, which might not be the safest or most effective. The fact that they get threats shows that it's not working well. Their justification is about creating a deterrent effect, but if it's causing more issues, maybe it's not the right approach. Plus, the humor aspect might trivialize a serious problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions are good, but their method is problematic. They might be causing more harm than good, even if unintentionally. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not using a more effective and safer method of intervention.\n"
