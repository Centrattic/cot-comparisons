Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. So, the author is in a big city and has been loud-boooing cat-callers for two months. They mention that people think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and unwanted. The author's action is a form of intervention, but is it appropriate? On one hand, they're trying to stop harassment. On the other hand, their method might escalate the situation. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, which could lead to violence. \n\nIs it their responsibility to intervene? Some might say yes, promoting a safer environment. Others might argue that it's not their place and that it could make things worse by drawing attention or causing confrontation. The author admits they find it funny, which adds a layer of personal enjoyment, which might not be the best motive.\n\nAlso, the effectiveness of their method is questionable. If the goal is to stop cat-calling, does loud heckling actually help, or does it just create more tension? The author's size might protect them from physical harm, but others might not be as fortunate. There's also the possibility that the cat-caller might target the heckler instead, or that the situation escalates beyond control.\n\nAnother angle: public behavior norms. In some cultures, direct confrontation might be seen as positive, while in others, it's disruptive. The author's actions could be seen as a form of activism, but maybe it's not the most effective or respectful way. Maybe a better approach would be to report the behavior to authorities or support systemic changes rather than direct confrontation.\n\nThe people around them think they're an asshole. The author's method might not be getting the desired social change but instead causing more conflict. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If the method is causing more harm than good, then maybe the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, if they're standing up against harassment, they might be justified.\n\nBut the author is also taking personal pleasure in it. That could be problematic because it's not purely altruistic. The mix of motives might be an issue. Also, considering that the cat-caller's actions are already negative, but the heckling could be seen as a form of vigilantism. There's a line between standing up for others and creating chaos.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the intention is good (stopping harassment), but the method is questionable (public heckling leading to threats, possible escalation, and personal enjoyment). The effectiveness is uncertain, and the social impact might be negative. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their approach could be counterproductive and potentially harmful, even if their intent is positive.\n"
