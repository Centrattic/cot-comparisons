Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style question is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is in a big city now and has taken to loudly \"booo\"ing catcallers. They admit it's controversial because some people think they're an asshole, but their reasoning is that they want to make the catcallers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, and the author is trying to stop it. So, from a moral standpoint, their intention is positive. But the method is public shaming. Is public shaming acceptable in this context?\n\nNow, the author is facing backlash from both men and women. Men see them as a \"white knight\" who's likely to get into trouble, while women think it draws more attention and makes the situation worse. The author's rationale is that making the catcallers uncomfortable could deter them. That makes sense because if the catcaller feels judged, maybe they'll think twice next time. But is it effective? Are there studies or evidence about the effectiveness of public shaming in stopping harassment?\n\nAlso, the author mentions they find it funny. That might come off as dismissive of the seriousness of the situation for the victims. However, using humor as a way to cope or to highlight the absurdity of the catcalling isn't necessarily wrong, but it could be seen as trivializing the issue.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a \"big fucker,\" so they might be in a position where they can handle the threats without being physically harmed. But even if they can take the threats, is it responsible to escalate the situation? If someone else tried this, they might not be as safe. It's a personal choice, but is it a responsible one?\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, unless the heckling is threatening or inciting violence, it's probably within free speech. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. So the author isn't breaking the law, but are they morally at fault?\n\nThe author is also trying to create a culture where others will speak up. That's a noble goal, but the method of doing it through public shaming could be counterproductive. If it makes the situation more confrontational, perhaps it's not the best approach. However, if it's effective in that area, maybe it's a useful tactic.\n\nSo, weighing the intention (stop harassment) against the method (public shaming that could cause more attention or escalate the situation). It's a gray area. The author isn't the one harassing, so they're not in the wrong in that sense. But maybe their approach could be seen as confrontational. The question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is B (Not in the wrong), then the reasoning would be that their intent is good and they're addressing harassment. If A (in the wrong), it's because they might be making it worse or using a confrontational method that's not effective.\n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't the one committing the harassment. They're trying to stop it, even if their method is controversial. So, while others may disagree with the approach, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address the issue. Therefore, the answer is B."
