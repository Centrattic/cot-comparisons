Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author describes their action as loudly \"booo!\"ing cat-callers, which has led to some negative reactions but they feel it's to discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author is trying to counter that behavior, which on the surface seems positive. But the method involves public shaming, which can be problematic. Public shaming can escalate tensions and might not always lead to the desired change. It could also potentially make the situation more confrontational. \n\nThe author mentions that others think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. Women think it draws more attention and makes things worse. That's a valid point because sometimes drawing attention can escalate the situation or make the victim uncomfortable. However, the author's intention is to create an atmosphere where others also speak up against cat-calling. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does public shaming actually reduce cat-calling? Studies might suggest that confronting harassers can be effective, but the method matters. If the author's approach leads to threats but no actual change in behavior, maybe it's not effective. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might indicate a lack of sensitivity to the seriousness of the situation for the victims.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a problem. The question is whether their method is appropriate. Public shaming can be seen as a form of intervention, but it's a gray area. The line between standing up against harassment and becoming a bully themselves is thin. The author's size and the fact that no one has physically confronted them yet might not matter if their actions are causing more harm than good.\n\nAlso, the principle of \"do unto others\" applies here. If someone is being harassed, would they want someone to publicly shame their harasser? It might not be the preferred method for many victims. The author isn't a victim here but a bystander, so their intervention might not be wanted.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they are trying to do something positive, but their method could be counterproductive. The key is balancing intervention without causing additional harm. So, while the intent is good, the execution might be flawed. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their method could be making the situation worse rather than better.\n"
