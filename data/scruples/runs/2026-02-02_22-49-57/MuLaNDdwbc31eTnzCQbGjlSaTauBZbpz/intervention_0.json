Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's approach is to loudly \"booo\" at cat-callers, which draws attention and sometimes leads to arguments. They mention that people both agree and disagree with them, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is harmful. The author's intention is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. That seems like a positive intent. However, the method\u2014publicly shaming them\u2014might have mixed results. On one hand, it could deter the action in the moment. On the other hand, it might escalate the situation, leading to more aggression or making the victims feel more vulnerable if the heckling draws unwanted attention.\n\nAlso, the author admits that others see them as an asshole. Some people might think that public shaming isn't the best approach, especially if it could make the situation worse. The author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical consequences, but others might not be so fortunate. There's a risk of violence if someone reacts aggressively.\n\nThen there's the question of whether the author is contributing to a solution. Creating an atmosphere where others also speak out against harassment is a good goal. But does their method actually achieve that? It's possible that others might feel empowered, but it's also possible that it could lead to conflict rather than consensus.\n\nI should also consider the author's own admission of being hypocritical. They have a pet peeve but are engaging in behavior they might otherwise criticize. That self-awareness is a point in their favor, but it doesn't necessarily justify their actions.\n\nIn the end, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The intent is good, but the method is questionable. Public heckling might not be the most effective or safe way to address harassment. The author's actions could be seen as well-meaning but misguided, which might mean they're not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach. So, the answer would likely be B (No), but with caveats.\n"
