Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone heckling cat-callers by booing them loudly. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to stop cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. They mention that others think they're an asshole, but their intention is to discourage the behavior. The question is whether their actions make them the asshole.\n\nCat-calling is a form of harassment and is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful. The author is using a public shaming approach, which can be controversial. Public shaming can sometimes escalate situations. The author has faced threats but hasn't been physically attacked yet. \n\nOn one hand, standing up against harassment is commendable. The author's intention is good\u2014to create a deterrent effect and maybe encourage others to stop the behavior. On the other hand, using loud heckling might draw more attention to the situation, potentially making it worse. The author admits that women think they're drawing attention and making it worse. Also, the author is big and hasn't been attacked, but others might not be in that position. \n\nIs the author violating any social norms? Public shaming can be seen as vigilantism. Even if the intent is good, the method might be problematic. The author is taking it upon themselves to police others, which can lead to unintended consequences, like escalation or retaliation.\n\nBut then again, cat-calling isn't protected speech. The author is responding to harassment, which is a public issue. However, the method of response matters. The author's approach could be seen as proactive, but it's also confrontational. The key question is whether the author's actions cross a line into being hostile themselves.\n\nIn some contexts, intervening in harassment is seen as positive. However, the loud booing might not be the most effective or safe method. It's possible that the author is contributing to a hostile environment, even if their intent is to reduce harassment. The fact that others think they're an asshole suggests that their approach is not universally accepted.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions are a form of direct intervention against harassment. While the intent is good, the method could be problematic. However, since the author is targeting a behavior (cat-calling) that's widely considered wrong, their response might be justified. But if their method leads to more conflict or draws unnecessary attention, it might be counterproductive. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the method of intervention is appropriate. If the author is using a confrontational approach that risks escalating the situation, they might be in the wrong. But if the goal is to stop harassment in a public space, their actions could be seen as justified. The fact that they're not using violence but verbal reprimand leans towards them not being in the wrong. However, public shaming can have its downsides. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The author's intent is positive, but the method might not be the best. However, since cat-calling is a serious issue, their actions are a form of standing up against it. So maybe the answer is that they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the community consensus is that they're an asshole, that's a factor. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a form of direct intervention against harassment. While the method is confrontational and might not be the most effective, the intent is to stop harmful behavior. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
