Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has started doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their reasoning is that they want to discourage catcalling by making the perpetrators uncomfortable. They mention that people around them think they're an asshole, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" or that they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to address a negative behavior. However, their method is to loudly mock the catcallers with \"booo!\" sounds. This public confrontation might escalate the situation. The author also mentions getting cursed at and threats, but they claim to be physically intimidating so no one has acted on it yet.\n\nNow, are they in the wrong? On one hand, they're opposing harassment, which is a positive intent. But their method could be seen as aggressive or confrontational. The question is whether their means justify the end. Some might argue that public shaming isn't the best approach and could make the situation worse, as the victims might feel more uncomfortable. Others might support the idea of using social pressure to stop harassment.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that others think they're an asshole. The women think it draws attention and makes it worse, which is a valid concern. The author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also stop the behavior, but the effectiveness of this approach is questionable. Plus, the author admits they find it funny, which might indicate a lack of sensitivity.\n\nI need to decide if their actions are wrong. If the method is counterproductive or escalates the issue, even with good intentions, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the intent is to stop harassment and they're not using violence, maybe not. The key is whether their actions are considered appropriate in public for addressing harassment. Different cultures have different norms, but in many places, direct confrontation like this could be seen as problematic. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong, answer A.\n"
