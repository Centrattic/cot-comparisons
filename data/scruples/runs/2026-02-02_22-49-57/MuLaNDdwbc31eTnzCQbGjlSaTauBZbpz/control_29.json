Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The scenario is that the author, in a big city, has started to booscat-callers as a way to disrupt the behavior. They mention that people around them have mixed reactions: some see them as a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, others, especially women, think it's making things worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage them, and they also find it funny. They're unsure if they're an asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment, so the author's intention to stop it is understandable. However, their method is to confront the cat-caller directly by heckling. The question is whether this method crosses a line.\n\nHeckling could be seen as a form of free speech, but it's also possible that it escalates the situation. The author mentions that they get cussed at and sometimes threatened, but they brush it off because they're big. However, the reactions from others suggest that their method isn't effective. Women think it draws unwanted attention, which might actually make the situation worse by making the victims more self-conscious or putting them in a more uncomfortable position. If the author's actions are causing more harm than good, even with good intentions, they might be in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the action. The author hopes to create an atmosphere where others also speak up against cat-calling. If their actions don't lead to that outcome and instead create conflict without solving the root issue, then the method isn't effective. Also, the fact that it's entertaining for the author adds a layer of insensitivity\u2014it's not just about stopping harassment but using it for fun, which could trivialize the seriousness of the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a problem in their community. It's a proactive approach, albeit a confrontational one. However, the key here is whether the method is appropriate. Confronting in a public space with loud heckling might not be the best approach. There's also the aspect of personal safety\u2014while the author feels they can handle threats, others might not. Maybe there are better ways to address cat-calling without escalating tensions.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might view direct confrontation as a valid form of protest, while others see it as inciting further conflict. The author's actions are a form of intervention, but the effectiveness and appropriateness are debatable. Since the women's reactions suggest it's counterproductive, it's possible that the author is not considering the perspectives of the people directly affected, which is a key ethical consideration.\n\nIn summary, while the intention to stop harassment is commendable, the method employed by the author might be causing more harm than good. The lack of effectiveness in changing the cat-caller's behavior, the potential to discomfort victims further, and the addition of humor to a serious issue could place the author in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
