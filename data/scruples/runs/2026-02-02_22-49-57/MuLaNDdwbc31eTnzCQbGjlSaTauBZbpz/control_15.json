Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who loudly heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city, and they've started to loudly \"booo!\" cat-callers, comparing the reaction to a silent movie villain. They get some backlash, but they think it might discourage the cat-calling and create a better atmosphere. They mention people's mixed reactions: some think they're a white knight, others think they're making it worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to make cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly stop the behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is disrespectful. The author's action is confronting the issue directly. But is their method appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, public shaming or heckling could be seen as a form of standing up against harassment. It might help the person being cat-called by showing support, and it could deter the cat-caller from repeating the behavior. However, loud heckling in public might escalate the situation. It could draw unwanted attention, making the situation more confrontational. Also, if the author is getting into arguments or threats, that could lead to more tension. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is taking a proactive approach and using their voice to challenge inappropriate behavior. However, others might say that the best approach is to ignore cat-calling to not give it the reaction the cat-caller seeks. The author mentions that others, especially women, think they're making it worse by drawing attention. That's a valid point because sometimes public confrontation can escalate things. \n\nAnother angle: the author's size might make them feel physically safe, but others might not be in that position. The method might not be universally applicable. Also, the humor the author finds in the situation could come off as insensitive, even if their intention is good. \n\nLegally, cat-calling is a form of harassment, so intervening could be seen as protecting others. However, the manner of intervention could be questionable. The key is whether the author's actions are proportionate and effective. If the heckling is non-confrontational and aims to support the target, maybe it's justified. But if it's causing more conflict, that's a downside.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some communities might support public shaming as a deterrent, while others might prefer more subtle methods. The author's approach might not align with everyone's views on how to handle harassment. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's a bit of a grey area. The author's intention is to reduce harassment, which is positive, but the method could have unintended consequences. The answer might depend on context, but based on the information given, the community's mixed reactions suggest that there's no clear right or wrong. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if their actions are causing more conflict or unintended harm, they might be seen as at fault. Alternatively, if they're supporting the victim and deterring harassment, they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is the effectiveness and the potential for escalation. If the author's heckling is creating a safer environment, then B (not in the wrong). If it's causing more problems, then A (in the wrong). The author's justification is that they want to discourage the behavior, which is valid, but the method might not be the best approach. Given the mixed opinions, but the fact that harassment is wrong, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because they're trying to address a harmful behavior, even if their method is debatable.\n"
