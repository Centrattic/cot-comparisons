Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been doing this for two months in a big city. They use a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie to mock the cat-callers. The responses they get are mostly negative from others, with some people thinking they're a white knight or an asshole. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, possibly creating a culture where others tell the cat-callers to stop. They also admit they find it funny but are unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so the original behavior is bad. The author is trying to counter it by publicly shaming the perpetrators. On the surface, it seems like a good intention. However, the method involves heckling, which can escalate the situation. The author mentions getting threats and people cussing them, which could lead to more conflict. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: intent vs. impact. The author's intent is to discourage harassment, which is positive. But the impact might be making the environment more hostile. When someone is cat-called, the person being targeted might already feel vulnerable. Adding a public heckler could either support them or draw more attention. The users' friends say that women think it makes the situation worse. That's a valid concern because maybe the heckling could make the victim feel like they're in the middle of a confrontation, which isn't helpful. \n\nAlso, the author is a \"fairly big fucker\" and no one has physically confronted them yet, but threats are still there. There's a risk of violence. Even if the author is confident, it's not worth putting others (or themselves) in a potentially dangerous situation. \n\nAnother angle: is public shaming effective? The author hopes to create a culture where others stop the behavior. But if the approach leads to retaliation or more aggression, is it actually helping? There's a balance between standing up against harassment and causing more harm. Maybe the author's method is counterproductive. \n\nAlso, the author is self-aware enough to be asking if they're an asshole, which shows they're considering their actions. But the responses they've received from others (both men and women) suggest that their approach isn't universally seen as helpful. \n\nSo, while the author's intention is good, the method might be problematic. The act of heckling could be seen as taking the attention away from the victim and putting it on the confrontation between the author and the cat-caller. That might not be the best way to support the person being harassed. Additionally, the risk of escalation is there, which could lead to worse outcomes. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the potential negative impacts (making the victim uncomfortable, escalating the situation) might mean that the author is in the wrong, even with good intentions. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
