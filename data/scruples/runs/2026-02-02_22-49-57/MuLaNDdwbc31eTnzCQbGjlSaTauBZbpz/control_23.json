Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they've been loudly heckling cat-callers for two months by making a \"*booo!*\" sound like a silent movie villain. They get some cussing and threats, but no physical harm. Their friends think they're an asshole, with guys thinking they're a \"white knight\" and girls saying it makes things worse. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is responding to this harassment by publicly shaming the cat-callers. On one hand, they're trying to address a negative behavior, which could be seen as standing up against harassment. But on the other hand, their method might be counterproductive.\n\nThe author says that people think they're making it worse. The female perspective here is that drawing attention could escalate the situation or make the victims feel more uncomfortable. If the heckling leads to more confrontation, maybe the cat-callers become more aggressive, or the victims feel like they have to deal with both the harassment and the heckler's presence. Also, the author's approach might not be effective in stopping the behavior. If the cat-callers are just getting angry but continue their behavior, then the author's method isn't helping. Plus, the author is taking the role of a \"white knight,\" which can sometimes dismiss the actual victims' experiences and put the onus on others to defend them, which isn't ideal.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author has the right to intervene in such a public manner. While standing up against harassment is positive, the method should ideally protect the victim without putting them in more danger. The author's approach might be seen as confrontational and could potentially escalate the situation. It's possible that the best approach is to support the person being harassed rather than directly confronting the harasser in a way that might provoke a worse reaction.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they find it funny. That might indicate a lack of seriousness towards the harassment, which is problematic because harassment is not a joke. Using humor in such situations can undermine the severity of the issue and might not be respectful to the victims.\n\nHowever, the intention is to discourage the behavior. If the author's heckling actually stops the cat-caller, then it's a positive outcome. But if it's leading to more aggression or not changing the behavior, then it's not effective. The key here is whether the method is appropriate and respectful.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author is trying to do the right thing by addressing harassment, but their method might be flawed. The wrong part could be in how they're doing it\u2014publicly shaming in a way that could make the situation worse, not supporting the victims, and possibly not being respectful to the severity of the issue.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach is causing more harm than good and not the most effective or respectful way to address cat-calling.\n"
