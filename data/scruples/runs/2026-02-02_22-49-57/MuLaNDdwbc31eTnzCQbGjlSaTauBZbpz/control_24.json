Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has started doing this in a big city for two months, using a \"booo\" like a silent movie villain. They get some negative reactions from people, but the author thinks it might discourage cat-calling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author's intent is to stop it. But the method is public heckling. The question is whether this method is appropriate.\n\nThe author argues that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage them. However, others, both men and women, think the author is causing more attention or being an asshole. The author is confident in their physical ability, so they don't fear retaliation, but the approach could escalate the situation.\n\nPossible issues: The heckling might draw attention to the victim, making the situation worse. Also, public confrontation could lead to confrontation between the author and cat-caller, potentially escalating to violence. However, the author's intention is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a gray area. Some might say that any public confrontation is helpful, but others might argue that it's not the best approach. The key factors are intent vs. method. The author's intent is good, but the method could have unintended consequences. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the method is causing more harm than good, maybe. But if the intent is positive and they're not directly harming anyone, maybe not. The answer depends on whether the action is seen as justified given the intent and potential outcomes.\n"
