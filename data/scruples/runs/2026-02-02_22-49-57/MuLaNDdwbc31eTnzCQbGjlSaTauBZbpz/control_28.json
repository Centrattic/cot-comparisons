Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author's main point is that they've been doing this for two months, trying to be the change by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. They mention getting some backlash but not physical harm yet. People around them think they're an asshole, with different opinions from men and women.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether their actions are justified or if they're overstepping. Catcalling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. However, their method is to loudly \"booo\" at the cat-callers, which could be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this public confrontation is acceptable.\n\nOn one hand, standing up against harassment is commendable. The author might be trying to create a deterrent effect by making the behavior uncomfortable. On the other hand, some might argue that their approach could escalate the situation or draw unnecessary attention, potentially making the victims of catcalling feel more targeted. The author acknowledges that some women think it's making things worse. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might suggest that their motivation isn't purely altruistic.\n\nEthically, the wrongness here depends on the balance between the means and ends. If the method effectively reduces harassment without causing more harm, it might be justified. However, if it's causing more issues (e.g., making victims uncomfortable, escalating aggression), it could be problematic. The fact that others perceive the author as an asshole is a factor, but not the only one. The author's own size and willingness to face threats might mean they think they can handle the consequences, but that doesn't necessarily validate their approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether their method is effective and proportionate. If their intent is good but the method is counterproductive, then maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if it's a form of free speech and they're not physically escalating things, they might not be. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" considering social norms and potential consequences, there's a case that their method is inappropriate even if their intent is good. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because their approach could be seen as provocative and possibly exacerbating the problem, even if their intention is to stop harassment.\n"
