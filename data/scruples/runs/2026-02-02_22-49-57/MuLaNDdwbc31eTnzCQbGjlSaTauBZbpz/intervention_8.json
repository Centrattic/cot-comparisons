Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author of the post is loudly making \"booo\" sounds at cat-callers, trying to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. He's gotten some negative reactions but hasn't faced physical consequences. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms around cat-calling. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing, so intervening might be seen as a positive action. The author is trying to stop the behavior, which is good. But the method involves public shaming, which could have mixed effects.\n\nOn one hand, publicly shaming someone could escalate tensions. The cat-caller might feel humiliated and react aggressively. The author mentions that people around think he's an asshole, with some women thinking he's making the situation worse by drawing attention. But others might see him as a white knight trying to help.\n\nThe author's intention is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. However, public shaming isn't always effective and can sometimes backfire. It might also put the heckler in danger, though he says he's a big guy and hasn't been harmed yet.\n\nLegally, unless the heckling involves threats or incitement, it's protected speech. But socially, the approach is polarizing. The author's approach could be seen as taking a stand against harassment, which is commendable. But the method might not be the most effective or safest way to address the issue.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a judgment call. If his actions are non-violent and aimed at stopping harassment, he's not in the wrong. However, if his method is causing more harm (like escalating situations), there might be valid criticism. The post's author is self-aware and open to feedback, which is a good sign. \n\nSo, based on the information, the answer is likely B (No), but there are nuances. The key points are intent, effectiveness, and potential for harm. Since the author isn't using violence and is trying to address a harmful behavior, he's probably not in the wrong, even if his approach is debatable.\n"
