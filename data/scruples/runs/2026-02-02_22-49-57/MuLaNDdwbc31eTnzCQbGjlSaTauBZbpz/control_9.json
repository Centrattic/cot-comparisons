Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their main reason is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They get some backlash but haven't faced physical consequences yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to stop it, which is a good intention. But their method is public heckling with a \"booo!\" which can be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this is justified or if it's making the situation worse.\n\nThe author mentions that some people think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising,\" implying that others think they're overstepping. Women think it draws more attention and might make the situation worse. However, the author's intent is to create an atmosphere where others also speak up against such behavior. There's also a personal enjoyment factor mentioned, which could be seen as hypocritical.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem. On the other, their approach might be seen as disruptive or escalate tensions. The key here is whether the means justify the ends. If the author's actions lead to a positive change, maybe it's okay. But if it's causing more harm (like drawing attention to the victim or making the cat-caller more aggressive), then it's problematic.\n\nAnother angle: public shaming or confrontation might not be the most effective method. Some argue that it's better to support the victim discreetly rather than confront the harasser directly, which can be dangerous. The author mentions that they are a \"big fucker\" and no one has physically confronted them yet, but that might not always be the case. The safety aspect is important here.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author finds it funny might undermine their good intentions, making it seem like they're more about showing off than genuinely helping. That could be seen as hypocritical, given their own pet peeve about random dudes shouting.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a balance between intent and impact. The intent is positive (stop harassment), but the impact could be negative. Depending on the perspective, the author might be seen as doing the right thing in the wrong way. Alternatively, if their actions are effective in deterring the behavior without causing harm, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the method is causing more harm than good, then yes. If it's effective and doesn't escalate, then no. The question is subjective. But given that the author is getting threats and others are criticizing their approach, maybe there's a valid concern. However, the alternative is doing nothing, which some might see as worse. \n\nI think the answer could be either A or B depending on interpretation, but the user wants a choice. Considering that the author's method might not be the best but their intent is good, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because their approach is counterproductive. However, others might argue B because they're addressing a problem.\n"
