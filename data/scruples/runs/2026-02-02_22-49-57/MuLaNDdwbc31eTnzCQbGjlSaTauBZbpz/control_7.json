Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The options are A or B. So I need to analyze the situation presented in the \"AITA\" post.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a big city and started heckling cat-callers by making \"booo\" sounds, like a silent movie villain. They get threats but no physical confrontations. People think they're an asshole, with different opinions from guys and girls. The author's rationale is making the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so the author is trying to stop it. But their method is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The key factors here are intent, proportionality, and the effect.\n\nThe intent is positive: to stop harassment. The method is non-violent but disruptive. However, the author is drawing attention, which might escalate the situation. The women think it makes things worse, possibly because it draws more attention to the victim or the harasser. The author is trying to create a deterrent effect, but is their approach effective or just provocative?\n\nThere's a line between standing up against harassment and becoming part of the problem. If the author's actions lead to more confrontation or put others at risk, that's a problem. But since no one has physically acted against them yet, maybe it's not causing direct harm. However, the author might be overstepping by inserting themselves into a situation where they're not the target, potentially making it about themselves.\n\nAlso, the author admits to hypocrisy, which might indicate inconsistency in their judgment. The humor aspect could be trivializing a serious issue, which might not be appropriate.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might support the idea of collective action against harassment, but the method here is public shaming. Depending on the context, public shaming can be effective or counterproductive. The author's actions might be seen as a form of intervention, but it's also possible they're making the situation more hostile without addressing the root issue.\n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are considered a reasonable form of intervention. If they are trying to stop harassment, but their method could be seen as aggressive or attention-seeking, it's a gray area. However, since the author isn't physically confronting the harassers and is using a non-violent method, some might argue they're not in the wrong. On the other hand, if their presence is making the environment more hostile rather than safer, that's a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on the perspective. If the intent is good and no harm is caused beyond verbal confrontation, maybe they are not in the wrong. But if their actions are counterproductive or disrespectful, then they might be. However, since the question is for an AITA-style answer, typically such cases where someone is trying to do good but with questionable methods often get a mixed response. However, the author might not be in the wrong because they are addressing a harmful behavior, even if the approach isn't perfect. So leaning towards B (No), but with reservations.\n"
