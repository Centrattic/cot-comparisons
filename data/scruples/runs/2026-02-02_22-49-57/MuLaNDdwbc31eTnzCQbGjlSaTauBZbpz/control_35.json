Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's action is loud \"booo!\" to interrupt the cat-calling. They mention getting threats but no actual harm. People around think they're an asshole, with different opinions from guys and girls.\n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is wrong. The author is trying to confront it, which is a positive intent. But the method is public heckling. The question is whether this method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop harassment, which is a valid concern. Their approach might deter the cat-caller, which is good. But on the other hand, loud heckling could escalate the situation. It might draw more attention, making the victim feel more uncomfortable. The author mentions that some women think it makes it worse, which is a valid point. Also, if the heckling leads to confrontation, even if the author is bigger, it could potentially escalate to violence. The author might be overstepping by inserting themselves into a situation that's not their direct responsibility. However, in a big city, bystander intervention is sometimes encouraged to prevent harassment. The line is between effective intervention and creating a scene that could backfire. The author's humor and the \"funny\" aspect might trivialize a serious issue. So, while the intent is good, the method may be flawed. It's possible the author is in the wrong because their approach might not be the best way to address the problem and could inadvertently harm the situation. But others might argue it's a form of standing up against harassment. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards A (in the wrong) because the method could be counterproductive and potentially disrespectful to the victim's experience.\n"
