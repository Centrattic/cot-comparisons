Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if they're being a bad person by loudly heckling cat-callers. Their method is to \"booo!\" like in a silent movie when they see someone cat-calling. They get some negative reactions from people, but they feel like they're trying to make a change by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment, especially towards women. The author is trying to stop that behavior, which on the surface seems good. But the method they're using is public heckling. \n\nNow, the question is whether this is the right approach. On one hand, the author's intention is to discourage harassment, which is positive. But the reaction they get from others is that they're making things worse. Men think it's a bad idea because it might lead to conflict, and women think they're drawing attention to the situation, which could make victims feel more uncomfortable. \n\nThe author's rationale is that by making it uncomfortable for the cat-caller, they might stop. But does public shaming or heckling actually work? Maybe in some cases, but it could also escalate the situation. The author mentions that people are threatening them, even if not following through. So there's a risk of physical confrontation here. \n\nAlso, the author admits they find it funny, which might dilute the seriousness of the situation. Is it appropriate to be entertained by someone else's harassment? That could be seen as a bit callous. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced harm yet, but what if someone does confront them? The author might be putting themselves in a position where they could provoke a violent response. \n\nBut then again, the author is trying to be the change. Society often encourages speaking out against harassment, but the method here is loud public criticism. Is that the right method? Maybe not. Perhaps it's better to support the victims or report the behavior rather than directly confront the harasser in a public way that could turn violent. \n\nSo, the author's actions are well-intentioned but perhaps misguided. They're trying to do good but using a method that could be counterproductive and risky. The fact that others, including women, think it's making things worse suggests that the approach isn't effective and might even be harmful. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong not because they have the wrong intention, but because their method is causing more harm than good. They could be deterring the cat-caller but also drawing unnecessary attention and potentially escalating the situation. So the answer would be A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
