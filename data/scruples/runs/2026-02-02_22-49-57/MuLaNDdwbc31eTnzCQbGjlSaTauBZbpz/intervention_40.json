Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author's actions involve making a \"booo!\" sound at cat-callers, which has led to some backlash. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author moved to a big city two months ago and started this habit. Their motivation is to address a behavior they find objectionable\u2014cat-calling. They mention that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a culture where others also speak up. \n\nNow, the key question is whether their method is justified. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to counter this by publicly shaming the offenders. However, the author's approach is to heckle them, which can be seen as a form of intervention. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author is using public shaming, which can be effective in deterring such behavior. However, some might argue that it draws more attention to the situation, potentially making the victim feel more embarrassed or unsafe. The author acknowledges that some people, especially women, think this makes things worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not physically confronting the cat-callers but using a non-physical, vocal response. They are also aware of the risks and feel confident enough to stand their ground. The intention is to discourage harassment, which is a positive goal. \n\nHowever, the method might not be the most effective or safe. Public shaming can sometimes escalate tensions. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, but so far, no physical altercations. Still, it's a potential risk. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the intention is to stop harassment and the method is non-violent, it's a form of free speech and civic engagement. However, the effectiveness and the potential to make the situation more uncomfortable for the victim are points to consider. \n\nThe author's own admission of possibly being an asshole shows self-awareness. But given that cat-calling is harmful and they're trying to address it, their approach, while possibly not the best, isn't inherently wrong. The answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent is positive and the action is a form of peaceful protest, even if it's not universally supported."
