Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author explains that they've been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and perhaps discourage the behavior. They mention that both men and women around them think they're an asshole, with different opinions from each group. The author is conflicted because they might be helping but also causing more attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to stop something that's harmful. However, their method involves loud heckling, which could be seen as aggressive or confrontational. The question is whether their means justify the end goal.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't physically confronting the cat-callers, just using verbal interruption. This could be seen as a form of protest or standing up against harassment. Some might argue that it's a valid way to challenge inappropriate behavior in public spaces.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is drawing attention to the situation. The women's perspective here is that it might make things worse by drawing more attention. Also, the author is getting threatened, which could escalate the situation. Even though they're a \"big fucker,\" there's a risk involved. Plus, some people might see it as overstepping, as they're inserting themselves into someone else's experience of harassment.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does heckling actually stop the behavior? If it does, maybe it's justified. But if it causes more conflict without resolving the issue, it could be counterproductive. The author's motivation is good, but the method's effectiveness and appropriateness are in question.\n\nAlso, the author admits to finding it funny, which might be a bit hypocritical given their moral stance. That could affect how their actions are perceived.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might support direct action against harassment, while others prefer to report or avoid confrontation. The author's approach is a middle ground but might not be universally accepted.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer isn't straightforward. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their actions cross a line. They are trying to do good but using a method that others find problematic. It's possible they're not in the wrong because they're addressing harassment, but their method could be seen as part of the problem. However, the fact that they're causing escalation and drawing attention might mean they do cross the line. The answer might be A (Yes) because their approach could make things worse, even if the intention is good.\n"
