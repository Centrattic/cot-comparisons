Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. They use a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie, which leads to some backlash but no physical confrontations yet. People think he's an asshole, with men calling him a white knight and women saying he's making things worse. His reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to stop something harmful. However, his method is to publicly shame the cat-callers by heckling them. The question is whether this is a justified response or if he's overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, the author is addressing a problem (harassment) and trying to create a safer environment. He's not using violence, just verbal confrontation. The cat-callers are the ones engaging in unwanted behavior, so the author's response could be seen as a form of social accountability. If his actions lead to a deterrent effect, that's a positive outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that public shaming can escalate situations. The author is making the situation more confrontational, which could make the cat-caller more defensive or aggressive. Women's concern is that it draws attention to the situation, which might put the victims in a worse spot. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might suggest some personal satisfaction rather than pure altruism.\n\nBut the user's stance is that the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are intent and consequences. The author's intent is to stop harassment, which is a good motive. The consequences so far haven't been negative beyond verbal retorts, and the author is physically able to handle it. Since the cat-calling is the initial wrongdoing, the author's response is a form of public protest, which can be protective of others rather than aggressive without cause.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are a response to harassment, aiming to discourage it. While there are valid concerns about the method, the root issue is the cat-calling being wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
