Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they're asking if they're at fault for heckling cat-callers by making a loud \"booo!\" sound at them. They mention that they've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their reasoning is that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others also tell off the cat-callers. They also admit that people think they're an asshole, with guys thinking they're a \"white knight\" and girls thinking they're making things worse. They also find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is harassment, so the intention here is to stop that. But the method they're using is public shaming\u2014like the silent movie villain \"booo.\" The question is whether that's an appropriate response. \n\nOn one hand, intervening in some way to stop harassment is generally seen as positive. The author is trying to create a more hostile environment for the cat-callers, which could be effective. But on the other hand, public shaming can be confrontational. The author is making a scene, which might escalate the situation. The cat-caller might react angrily, which could then make things more dangerous. Also, the author mentions that people, including women, think they're making it worse by drawing attention. Maybe the cat-caller is already being ignored, and the author's response might not be the best way to address it.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are necessary. If the people around them mostly think they're an asshole, maybe there's a social norm being broken. Also, the author is putting themselves in a position where they might get into a conflict. They say they're a big person, so maybe they can handle it, but that's not the point. The point is whether their method is effective or ethical.\n\nThe author's rationale is about creating a deterrent. But does public shaming actually solve the problem? Or does it just create more hostility? Also, is it their place to intervene in this way? Some might say it's good to stand up against harassment, while others might say that it's not their role to do so and that it's better to let authorities handle it or to address it more directly, like telling the cat-caller off in a serious way.\n\nWomen's reactions are important here. They think the author is making things worse. Maybe because the presence of a loud male confronting another male could be seen as just another form of attention that the cat-caller might not care about, or it might even be intimidating for women to be in that situation. The author's method could inadvertently be creating a more hostile environment for women if the confrontation becomes more intense.\n\nAlso, the author's own enjoyment (\"I find it funny\") might be a factor. Is this a serious issue that shouldn't be treated as a joke? The line between being a humorous intervention and being dismissive of a serious problem is thin. If the author is coming off as mocking in a way that doesn't actually stop the harassment, then it might not be helpful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The intent is good, but the method could be questionable. The key factors are effectiveness, potential escalation, and respect for others. If the author's actions are causing more harm than good, then they might be in the wrong. But if their actions are actually deterring harassment without causing harm, maybe not. However, the fact that others see them as an asshole and that it's not effective in the way they hope (since it's not changing others' behavior) suggests that maybe the approach is flawed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because their method is ineffective, could escalate the situation, and may not be the best way to address harassment. However, some might argue it's a form of standing up against harassment, so B could be a possible answer. But given that the author is being confrontational in a public way, and others (especially women) think it's making things worse, the more likely answer is A.\n"
