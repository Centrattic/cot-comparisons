Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The original poster (OP) is in a big city and has started this habit for two months. They make a \"booo\" sound at cat-callers, which sometimes leads to cussing or threats from the cat-callers. Their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, while also finding it funny. Others split in their opinion: men think the OP is a \"white knight,\" women think it draws attention and makes things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the OP's actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so intervening could be seen as good. But the method is heckling, which might escalate the situation. The OP isn't physical, just verbal. But the method is disruptive. The question is whether this response crosses into being an asshole.\n\nThe OP's argument is that they're trying to discourage bad behavior. However, the heckling might draw more attention, making the victim (the person being cat-called) more uncomfortable. The women's opinion is that it makes things worse. On the other hand, the OP is trying to create an environment where others stop the cat-calling. But maybe the approach isn't effective or is counterproductive.\n\nIs the OP being an asshole? Asshole behavior usually involves causing harm or discomfort without consideration. While the intent is good, the method might be problematic. The heckling could be seen as taking the role of the cat-caller, just in a different way. Also, the OP finds it funny, which might indicate insensitivity. However, the threat of violence from the cat-callers is a risk, but the OP is physically big, so maybe they can handle it.\n\nConsidering all sides: The intent is to stop harassment, which is good. The method, however, might not be the best approach. Drawing attention could make the situation more stressful for the victim. Also, the OP's approach might not actually stop the cat-caller effectively. So even if the intent is good, the execution might be flawed, leading to the OP being considered in the wrong. Alternatively, some might argue that any action to deter harassment is justified. But since the question is about whether the OP is in the wrong, and given that others (especially women) think it's making things worse, it's a nuanced situation.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community usually looks at both intent and impact. The impact here is causing more attention and possibly making the situation worse, according to others. So even if the OP's motive is good, the outcome might still make them the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
