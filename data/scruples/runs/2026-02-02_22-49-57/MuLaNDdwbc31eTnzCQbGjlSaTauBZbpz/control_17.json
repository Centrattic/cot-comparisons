Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's main argument is that they're trying to discourage catcalling by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. They use a loud \"booo!\" like in a movie, which sometimes leads to threats but no actual harm. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Catcalling is a form of harassment, so the author is trying to stop something wrong. But the method here is public shaming or heckling. Is that justified? On one hand, it's standing up against harassment, which is a good cause. On the other, the author might be escalating the situation. \n\nThe author mentions that some people, especially women, think they're making things worse by drawing attention. That's a valid point because sometimes direct confrontation can put others at risk. But the author is doing it to create a better atmosphere where others might follow suit. \n\nAnother angle is the author's own admission that they might be a hypocrite. But their actions are intended to prevent harassment. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. Legally, unless they're causing direct harm, their heckling is probably protected speech. However, morally, if their actions lead to more threats or escalate the situation, is that their fault?\n\nThe author isn't physical, just verbal. They are big and haven't been harmed, so maybe they have the physical presence to handle it. But does that justify their actions? Some might say it's a form of vigilantism. Others might see it as a necessary response. \n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The intent is to stop harassment, which is good. The impact could be negative if it makes victims feel worse or if it leads to violence. But since no one has acted on the threats yet, maybe the impact is minimal. \n\nIn AITA terms, the community usually looks at whether the person's actions are reasonable and if they crossed a line. The author's method is non-violent but confrontational. It's a gray area. Some might argue that public shaming is not the best approach, but others support any action against harassment. \n\nSo, the answer depends on perspective. The author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a problem, but their method could be questionable. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the action is verbal and non-violent, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. The author should consider if their actions are effective and safe for others. But given the scenario, the answer is likely B.\n"
