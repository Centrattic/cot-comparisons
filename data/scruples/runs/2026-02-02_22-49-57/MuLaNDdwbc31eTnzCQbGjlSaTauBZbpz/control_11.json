Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has been loudly \"boooo\"ing cat-callers for two months. They get into this because they dislike cat-calling. Their reasoning is that making cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. However, people around them think the author is being an asshole. Men think they're being a \"white knight\" (which often means they're overstepping or trying to be a hero inappropriately), and women think it draws attention and makes things worse. The author is conflicted because they find it funny but are unsure if they're wrong.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the intent vs. the impact. The author's intent is to stop harassment by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. However, the method they're using is public heckling, which might have unintended consequences. The article mentions that some people think it makes the situation worse by drawing attention. Also, the author is getting threats, which could mean their approach is confrontational and not effective.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between stopping harassment and using the right method. Some might argue that public confrontation could escalate the situation or make the victims uncomfortable. Others might support it as a form of solidarity against harassment. However, if the method leads to threats or doesn't solve the problem, maybe it's not the best approach. The author's own admission that others see them as an asshole is a point in favor of them possibly being wrong. Also, the fact that women, who are the targets of cat-calling, think it's making things worse suggests that the approach might not be helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is good. They want to discourage harassment. But the effectiveness and method matter. If the heckling leads to more conflict without addressing the root issue, maybe it's not the right approach. Also, the author is using humor (\"fairly big fucker\") which might indicate a lack of consideration for the seriousness of the issue.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their method could be counterproductive, even if the intent is good. The key is that the approach is not widely supported, and it's making the situation worse according to those affected. Alternatively, if the cat-calling is wrong, maybe intervening in any way is justified. But since the method is causing more issues, maybe the author should stop and find another way.\n"
