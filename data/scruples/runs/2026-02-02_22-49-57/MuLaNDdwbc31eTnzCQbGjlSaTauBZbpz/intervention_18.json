Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't wrong, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a big city and has started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers. They get some backlash, but they feel it's to discourage the behavior. Their rationale is making the cat-caller uncomfortable and promoting a better atmosphere. Others think they're an asshole, with some saying it draws more attention or that they're a \"white knight.\"\n\nI need to evaluate if their actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening could be seen as positive. Public shaming or heckling might be a form of social accountability. However, does the method matter? Loudly mocking someone could escalate tension, even if the intent is good. There's a risk of confrontation or making the situation worse, which is why some people (especially women) might think it draws more attention. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying physical intimidation. If they're using their presence to deter violence, maybe that's a factor. But legally, is public heckling against someone's free speech? In many places, you can't be arrested for expressing disapproval, unless it's a direct threat. The author isn't threatening, just making noise.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The intent is good (stopping harassment), but the method is confrontational. Some might argue that it's a necessary intervention in a society where cat-calling is rampant. Others might say it's not their place to police others, and that it could lead to unintended consequences, like the cat-caller becoming more hostile or the situation escalating.\n\nThe author seems to be aware of the criticism and is questioning their approach. The key points are the effectiveness of their method and whether the means justify the ends. Since the question is about being in the wrong, it's about whether their actions cross a line into being an asshole, even if the intent is good.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often look at both intent and impact. The author's impact is causing discomfort to the cat-caller, which is the goal, but also possibly causing more tension. However, given that the cat-caller's actions are the problem, the author's response is a form of social resistance. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not wrong), because the intent is to stop harassment, and their method is non-violent, even if confrontational. Others might say it's still wrong because it's aggressive, but the justification is strong here.\n"
