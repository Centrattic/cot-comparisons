Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author describes their actions as loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers, which sometimes leads to verbal abuse from the offenders. They mention that some people think they're a jerk, but their rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so the author is standing up against something that's widely considered inappropriate. The question is whether the author's method of response is justified. On one hand, intervening in such situations can be seen as a form of allyship, supporting the victims. On the other hand, the author might be drawing attention to the situation, which could potentially escalate things or even make the victim feel more uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's actions are direct but non-violent. They're not physically confronting the cat-callers, just using verbal heckling. The response from others is mostly verbal (cussing, threats, but no actual harm). The author is aware that some people disapprove, but they believe in the potential deterrent effect.\n\nNow, the ethical angle. Is it wrong to try to stop harassment, even if the method is disruptive? In many cultures, bystander intervention is encouraged to prevent harassment. However, the method here is public and might be seen as confrontational. But since the author isn't escalating with violence and is trying to create a deterrent, it's a form of peaceful protest. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for drawing attention. If a woman is being cat-called, adding a \"booo\" might make the situation more uncomfortable for her. But the author might argue that the presence of a supportive bystander could make her feel safer. The balance here is tricky, but the intent is to stop the harassment.\n\nThe author's own admission that they \"could very well be an asshole\" shows self-awareness, but the intent seems good. The community's mixed reactions (some seeing them as a white knight, others as making things worse) indicate that opinions are divided. However, the key is whether the action is inherently wrong. Since the author isn't causing physical harm and is targeting the harassment itself, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. It's a matter of opinion on whether the method is effective or appropriate, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n"
