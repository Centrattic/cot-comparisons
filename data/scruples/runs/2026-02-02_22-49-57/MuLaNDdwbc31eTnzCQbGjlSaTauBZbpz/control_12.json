Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author says they've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their reason is that cat-calling is a pet peeve, and they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. They use a \"booo!\" like in silent movies, which sometimes leads to curses or threats but no actual violence. People around think they're an asshole, with guys thinking they're a \"white knight\" and girls thinking they make things worse. The author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others stop such behavior, but they're unsure if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address it, which seems positive. But their method is public heckling. The key here is whether their method is appropriate or if it escalates the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that some people think they're making things worse by drawing attention. That's a valid point because sometimes public confrontation can escalate tensions. However, others might argue that publicly calling out bad behavior can deter it. The author's intention is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. \n\nBut is the author overstepping? They are intervening in a situation that might not be their direct responsibility. While their intent is good, the method could be seen as aggressive or confrontational. The threats they receive suggest that their approach is provocative. However, they haven't faced actual harm, so maybe they're willing to take that risk. \n\nAnother angle is whether their actions are effective. The author might believe they're helping create a culture where such behavior is discouraged, but if the response is negative from both men and women, maybe their approach isn't effective. The women's perspective here is that they're making it worse, which is a significant point. If the goal is to reduce harassment, making the situation more uncomfortable for the victim isn't helpful. \n\nBut the author isn't the one being harassed; they're an observer. So their action might be to support the person being harassed. However, the method could inadvertently draw more attention to the situation, potentially making the victim feel more exposed. \n\nLegally, unless the heckling involves threats or incitement, it's protected speech. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a form of intervention. There's a debate on the effectiveness and appropriateness of public shaming. Some might argue that it's a valid way to call out bad behavior, while others say it's not the best approach. The author is in a big city where such interactions might be more common, and their approach is direct but non-violent. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's method is counterproductive. If the goal is to stop harassment, maybe a better approach is to support the victim or report the behavior rather than confront the harasser publicly. However, the author's intention is to deter future behavior by making the harasser uncomfortable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is good, their method could be seen as confrontational and possibly making the situation worse. The fact that others (especially women) think it's making things worse suggests that socially, they might be in the wrong. But others might support their approach. So, the answer depends on weighing the intent against the impact. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and considering the mixed reactions and potential negative impact, the answer might lean towards A (yes, they're in the wrong). But there's a counterargument for B. However, given that the person being harassed might not appreciate the attention, and the author's method could be seen as aggressive, A might be correct.\n"
