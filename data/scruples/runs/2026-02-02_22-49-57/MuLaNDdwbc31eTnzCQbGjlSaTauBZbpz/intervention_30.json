Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author lives in a big city and has started loudly \"booo!\"-ing cat-callers they encounter. They acknowledge that some people think they're an asshole, but they believe they're discouraging bad behavior and making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers. The question is whether they're wrong (A or B).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to stop that. But their method is heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The author mentions that people think they're an asshole, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" (which often implies someone trying to be a hero but causing more harm) and others thinking they're drawing attention and making it worse. The author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might deter them and create a culture where others also stop the behavior. They also admit they find it funny, which might be a factor.\n\nSo, the key points are: the problem being addressed (harassment) is serious, but the method (public heckling) might not be the best approach. The author is trying to do good, but others are questioning if their method is counterproductive or inconsiderate.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is harmful, and the author is trying to intervene. On the other hand, heckling might escalate the situation, draw unwanted attention, or even put the author at risk. The author says they're a \"big fucker\" and no one has acted on threats yet, but that doesn't mean there's no risk. Also, if the heckling leads to more hostility, it could make the victim feel self-conscious or in danger. Some people might argue that it's better to address the harassment without involving oneself in a confrontational way, perhaps by reporting it or supporting the victim discreetly.\n\nHowever, others might support the author's approach as standing up against harassment. The question is whether their method is acceptable. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the AITA-style question often looks for whether the person's actions are widely seen as inappropriate despite good intentions.\n\nI should also consider the potential consequences. If the author's heckling makes the situation worse for the victim (e.g., the victim feels more embarrassed or scared because of the public attention), then the author might be part of the problem. Conversely, if their actions effectively deter the cat-caller and don't harm the victim, they're justified.\n\nThe author's admission that they find it funny complicates things a bit. It suggests that part of their motivation is personal enjoyment, which could be seen as insincere if their main concern is stopping harassment. However, humor can sometimes be a way to cope with or diffuse tense situations.\n\nIn the AITA format, the answer often depends on societal norms and whether the action crossed a line. While the intention is good, the method might be problematic. The author is taking a public stance, which could be seen as taking sides in a way that's not helpful. Also, the response from others (cussing, threats) indicates that the method is confrontational and perhaps not effective.\n\nSo, weighing all factors: the problem is valid, the method is confrontational, others are critical of it, and there's a risk of making the situation worse. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, not because they're trying to help, but because their method is inappropriate. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the community in the AITA context often supports such actions, the answer could be B. However, in many AITA scenarios, the line is crossed when the person's method causes more harm than good, even if intentions are good.\n"
