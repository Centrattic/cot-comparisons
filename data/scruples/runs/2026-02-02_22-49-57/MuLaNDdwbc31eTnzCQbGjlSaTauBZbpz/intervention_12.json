Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down. The author moved to a big city two months ago and has been using a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain to confront cat-callers. They get cursed at and threatened sometimes but haven't faced physical consequences. The community reactions are mixed: guys think they're a white knight risking a beating, and girls think it's making things worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage their behavior and create a better atmosphere where others can step in. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what heckling entails. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so interrupting it could be seen as standing up against harassment. But the method is loud and public. Maybe the author is using a humorous or non-confrontational approach, which some might see as appropriate. However, others might argue that it's not their place to intervene, or that it escalates the situation. The key points are the effectiveness, the potential for escalation, and the ethical responsibility.\n\nThe author's rationale is about discouraging the behavior by making it uncomfortable. That's a common argument for public shaming or social disapproval. But the question is whether they're overstepping. Cat-calling is a problem rooted in power dynamics and gender issues. By heckling, the author might be challenging that behavior, but maybe in a way that's not helpful. For example, if it draws more attention to the victim, that's a valid concern. Some people might feel that the victim is now in a worse position if the cat-caller reacts aggressively to the heckler.\n\nAlso, the responses from others: guys see it as a white knight (possibly naive or reckless) and girls think it's making it worse. There's a divide here. The author needs to consider if their approach is actually beneficial or if it's causing more harm by putting the victim in a spotlight. Maybe there's a better, safer way to address it, like reporting or creating a culture where people can speak up without public confrontation.\n\nBut the author isn't physically confronting them, just verbally. Verbal interruption can be a form of bystander intervention, which is encouraged in some cases. The problem is the judgment of whether the method is appropriate. If the author is big and hasn't faced physical retaliation, but the verbal backlash and threats are still problematic. The question is whether the author's actions are justified as a form of social accountability without causing more harm.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, addressing harassment is important. On the other, the method chosen might not be the most effective and could have unintended consequences. The author's intention to create a better atmosphere is good, but they should also be aware of the potential risks and whether their actions align with what the victims actually want. Since they admit to possibly being an asshole, they're open to reconsidering. So maybe the answer is that they aren't in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. The community's mixed reactions suggest that it's subjective, but I have to decide between A and B. If the author's intent is to stop harassment without causing harm, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if their method is causing more harm than good, then they might be. I'm leaning towards B (No) because the intent is to discourage bad behavior, but I need to check if heckling is an acceptable form of intervention. Some sources say that verbal interruption can be effective, but it's important to prioritize the safety of the victim. If the author is not putting the victim at risk and is instead being a safe bystander, then it's not the wrong. However, if the heckling is done in a way that could escalate the situation or make the victim more uncomfortable, then it's a problem. The author's approach seems non-threatening, so maybe B is correct.\n"
