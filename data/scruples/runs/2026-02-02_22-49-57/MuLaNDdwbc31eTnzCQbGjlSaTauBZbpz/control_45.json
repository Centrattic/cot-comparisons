Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been loudly making \"booo\" sounds at cat-callers in a big city. They mention that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. However, both guys and girls are giving negative reactions. The author is questioning if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author's intention is to stop it, which is a good motive. But the method they're using is public shaming or heckling. The question is whether that method is acceptable.\n\nOn one hand, bystander intervention is often encouraged to stop harassment. Some people do support standing up against such behavior. But the author's approach is to loudly mock the cat-caller. That could be seen as confrontational. The problem is that this might escalate the situation. The author mentions that they get cursed at and threats, which could lead to more conflict. Even if they're physically able to handle it, it might not be the safest approach.\n\nAlso, the author says that other people think they're being an asshole. Women think it draws more attention and makes it worse. Maybe the heckling could make the victim feel more self-conscious or unsafe. For example, if the victim is already uncomfortable, adding a loud reaction might not help. It's possible that the cat-caller might direct their anger towards the victim or the heckler, leading to a worse situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to stop the behavior. If their actions do deter the cat-caller, even if it's uncomfortable for the cat-caller, it might be effective. But is it justifiable to use public shaming? There's a line between standing up against harassment and becoming a vigilante. The author admits they find it funny, which might suggest that their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic. \n\nAnother point is that in public spaces, everyone has the right to feel safe. However, the method of intervention should be respectful and not escalate the situation. Maybe a better approach would be to directly tell the cat-caller to stop, which is more direct and less confrontational. Or to support the person being harassed, like walking with them or offering a nod of solidarity. \n\nThe author is in a big city where such incidents might be more common. But using a \"booo\" like in a movie could be seen as mocking the situation, which might not be the best way to handle it. It's possible that some people might think it's humorous or empowering, but others might see it as making light of a serious issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intent is good, but the method could be problematic. It's possible they are in the wrong because their approach might not be the most effective or respectful way to address the issue. Public shaming can sometimes be counterproductive, leading to more conflict rather than discouraging the behavior. The fact that others are criticizing their approach suggests that it's not universally seen as right. However, the alternative is that they're trying to do the right thing, even if their method is flawed. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used could be harmful or counterproductive, even if the intention is good. But it's a nuanced issue. The key here is whether the heckling is an appropriate form of intervention. Since the author is causing more conflict and others are advising against it, it's likely that they are in the wrong.\n"
