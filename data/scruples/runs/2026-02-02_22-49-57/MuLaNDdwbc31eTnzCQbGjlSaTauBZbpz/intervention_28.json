Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's approach is to loudly mock the cat-callers with a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie. They've faced some backlash, with both men and women having different opinions. The author justifies it by wanting to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so intervening could be seen as standing up against it. But the method matters. The author is using public shaming, which can be effective but might also escalate tensions. The question is whether their method crosses a line.\n\nThe author mentions that they are a \"big fucker\" and no one has physically confronted them yet. But threats are still present. Public shaming can sometimes backfire, making the situation more hostile. Women might think it draws more attention, which could make victims feel unsafe. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might indicate a lack of seriousness about the harassment issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the intention is to stop harassment, which is positive. But the method's effectiveness and appropriateness are debatable. Maybe there are better ways to address it without escalating. The author is in a big city, so the environment might be different from smaller towns. Still, using public ridicule might not be the best approach. It's possible the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to combat a negative behavior, but there's room to argue that their method is problematic. However, since the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" considering intent and societal views on harassment, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a counterargument that their method could be counterproductive. Hmm.\n"
