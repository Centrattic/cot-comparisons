Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author says they've been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their motivation is to make cat-calling uncomfortable for the perpetrators, hoping to discourage the behavior. They mention that others see them as an asshole, with both men and women criticizing their approach. The author's rationale is that creating discomfort might lead to a better atmosphere where others stop such behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author's intent is to stop it, which is a positive goal. However, the method involves public heckling, which could escalate the situation. The question is whether this method is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem that affects many people, especially women. By publicly calling out the cat-callers, they might be supporting victims and deterring the harassers. Their action could also encourage others to speak up, fostering a culture against harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, using loud heckling might escalate tension. The cat-callers respond with curses and threats, which could make the situation more confrontational. The author acknowledges they're a \"big fucker\" and no one has physically attacked them yet, but there's a risk of violence. Also, some might argue that publicly shaming someone, even if they're wrong, isn't the best approach. It could lead to more hostility without resolving the underlying issue.\n\nThe author's humor about finding it funny adds another layer. While intent matters, the effectiveness of their approach is debatable. Critics might say it's not their role to police others in that way, and it could draw unwanted attention, making things worse for everyone involved.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement against harassment, so public intervention might be seen as a good deed by some. However, others might prefer reporting incidents to authorities instead of confrontation. The line between standing up against harassment and creating a hostile environment is thin here.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's intention is good, but the method is contentious. It's possible they are not in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue, but there are valid arguments against their approach. The final answer hinges on whether the means justify the ends and the potential for escalation.\n"
