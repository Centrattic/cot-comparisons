Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds. The author's motivation is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They also mention that people think they're an asshole or a \"white knight.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so the author's intent is to stop that. But the method they're using is public and maybe confrontational. Is it their place to intervene? Well, in many cases, bystander intervention is encouraged to prevent harassment. But the way they're doing it\u2014heckling loudly\u2014could have unintended consequences.\n\nThe author says it's funny, but others think it's making things worse. Why? Maybe because the \"booo!\" is seen as mocking the victim instead of directly addressing the harasser. Also, the cat-caller might just target the heckler instead of the original victim, escalating the situation. The author argues that creating an atmosphere where people tell each other off is a good thing, but their approach might not be the most effective or safe.\n\nI should think about the potential outcomes. If the heckling makes the cat-caller stop, that's positive. But if it leads to more aggression or puts the author at risk, it's problematic. The author says they're big and no one has acted on threats, but that's not a guarantee. Also, some people might not appreciate the heckling as a form of support, especially if it's disruptive or perceived as attention-seeking.\n\nAnother angle: the author's action could be a form of free speech. They have the right to express disapproval. However, public heckling might not be the best method. It's possible that a more direct approach, like confronting the harasser with a clear message, could be more effective and less ambiguous.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might view the heckling as a positive stand against harassment, while others might see it as overstepping. The author's method might not be as helpful as they think. The key is whether their action genuinely helps the victim and deters harassment without causing more harm. If the \"booo!\" is just for show and doesn't address the root issue, maybe it's not the right approach.\n\nAlso, the author's own safety is a factor. If they're provoking people, even if they're confident, it's a risk. Effective intervention strategies often involve things like direct confrontation, calling out the behavior, or using authority (like security or police). Loudly booing might be seen as a passive or performative action rather than a constructive one.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author's intent is good, but the method might be questionable. It could be counterproductive. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because their approach isn't the most effective and could be seen as making the situation worse, even if unintended. However, if the community supports their action and it works in their context, maybe B. But given the responses they're getting from others, it's more likely A.\n"
