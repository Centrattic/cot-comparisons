Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about loudly heckling cat-callers. The author says they do this to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. They've been doing it for two months in a big city.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop it by publicly shaming the perpetrators. But is their method acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to address a problematic behavior. They're not using violence, just verbal confrontation. They argue that creating an atmosphere where others might also speak up against cat-calling is positive. However, they admit that their heckling gets them into confrontations, with threats from the cat-callers. Also, both men and women have different opinions on whether this approach is helpful or harmful.\n\nThe author is aware of being a hypocrite, given their own pet peeve but engaging in similar behavior. The key question is whether their method of intervention is effective and respectful. Public shaming can sometimes escalate tensions and might not address the root issue. Moreover, it could potentially put the author at risk, even though they mention they're physically capable of handling it.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is infringing on someone else's actions. The cat-caller is the one initiating the harassment, so the author's response is a form of intervention. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author's heckling is a direct response to harassment, it's a form of standing up against it. However, if their method is causing more harm (drawing attention, making the situation more confrontational), that might be a problem.\n\nThe community's reaction is mixed. Some see them as a white knight, others as creating more issues. The author acknowledges the possibility of being an asshole. The effectiveness of their approach is questionable, but their intent is to stop harassment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. While the goal is positive, the method might not be the most effective or appropriate. There could be better ways to address cat-calling, like reporting to authorities or encouraging bystander intervention without public confrontation. The author might be overstepping by using their own form of public shaming, which could inadvertently reinforce the negative behavior through confrontation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their method could be counterproductive and potentially escalate the situation. Even if the intent is good, the method's impact is questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, they are in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the intent is to address harassment. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually refers to the action's morality and appropriateness. Since cat-calling is wrong, interrupting it is right, but the method might not be.\n"
