Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started publicly calling out cat-callers by making loud \"booo\" sounds, like mocking a villain. They mention getting cussed at and threats, but they're physically big so no one has confronted them yet. People around think they're an asshole, with some saying they're a white knight (which might mean they think the author is overstepping) or that they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nThe author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create an environment where others also call out the cat-calling. They also admit they find it funny, which could be a complicating factor.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. However, their method is public heckling, which might be seen as confrontational. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the cat-caller is engaging in harassment, then the author's intervention could be seen as a form of bystander intervention, which is often encouraged. However, the method might be problematic. Loudly mocking the cat-caller could escalate the situation. The threats from the cat-caller suggest that the heckling is confrontational. The author acknowledges that others think they're making things worse, possibly by drawing more attention. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author's actions are meant to stop harassment, they could be seen as taking a stand against inappropriate behavior. However, using public shaming or mockery might not be the most effective or safe method. It could also potentially draw unwanted attention to the victims, though the author is the one intervening.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a bystander trying to help. Bystander intervention is generally a positive action. But the method here is to mock the harasser, which might not be the best approach. However, unless the author is physically confronting or threatening the cat-caller, their actions might be protected as free speech. \n\nBut the question isn't about legality, it's about moral wrongdoing. The author's intention is good, but the execution might be questionable. The people around think they're an asshole. However, the alternative is doing nothing while harassment occurs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the intent is to stop harassment, then maybe not. But if the method is counterproductive or harmful, then perhaps. But the author isn't harming anyone; they're just making noise. The cat-caller is the one initiating the harassment, so the author's reaction could be justified as a form of social accountability.\n\nBut the answer depends on whether the intervention is considered appropriate. Some might argue that public shaming isn't the way to go, but others might support it as a way to deter harassment. Since the author is not using violence or direct threats, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if their actions are causing more harm than good (e.g., drawing attention to the victim), that's a different story. But the author is the one heckling, not the victim. The victims might not even be involved; the author is stepping in as a bystander.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method could be debated, the author's intent to stop harassment is positive. They aren't committing a wrong action themselves; they're responding to someone else's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, they're not in the wrong).\n"
