Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who's heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a big city and has started loudly booing people who catcall others. They mention that they do this to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. The responses from others are mixed: some guys think they're overstepping, women think they're making it worse by drawing attention, and the author enjoys it a bit but wonders if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally considered harassment and is bad. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But the method is loud heckling. Is that justified? \n\nOn one hand, stopping harassment is important. If the author's actions prevent others from being harassed, that's good. But on the other hand, their approach might be escalating the situation. When someone is heckled, they might become more aggressive or angry, which could lead to a dangerous situation. Also, the author mentions that some people think it's making things worse by drawing attention. Maybe the cat-caller feels threatened and could react violently. \n\nAnother angle: is the author's method appropriate? Public shaming can be seen as a form of vigilantism. It's possible that the cat-caller isn't aware they're being harassing, or they might not see it as harassment. The author's loud reaction might not be the best way to address it. Also, the author is in a physical position where they can handle threats, but others might not be. \n\nThe author's intention is to discourage harassment by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. However, the effectiveness of this approach isn't clear. Maybe the right approach is to confront in a calmer manner, like telling the cat-caller to stop, rather than booing loudly. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they find it funny. Mixing humor with a serious issue could be problematic because it might trivialize the harassment. The women's perspective here is that the situation is worsened by more attention, which could make the victim feel unsafe or embarrassed. \n\nIn terms of personal responsibility, the author is taking action, but perhaps not the most constructive one. Maybe reporting the behavior to authorities or supporting the victim in a different way would be better. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions are good, but their method might be harmful. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because their approach risks escalating the situation and might not effectively address the harassment. The right action might be to intervene in a safer, more constructive way.\n"
