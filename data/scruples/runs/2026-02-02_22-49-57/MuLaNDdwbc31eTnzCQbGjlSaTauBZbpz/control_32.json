Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who writes about heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly booing cat-callers to make them uncomfortable and maybe stop the behavior. They get responses like curses and threats but haven't been attacked. People around think they're an asshole, with some thinking they're a white knight and others that they're making it worse. The author's rationale is to discourage the cat-caller and create a more supportive environment, but they're also finding it funny.\n\nSo, the question is whether this action is wrong. The key points here are about the ethics of confronting cat-calling and the methods used. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and respectful to address, but the method here is public heckling. The author's intent is to stop the behavior, which is good. However, their method involves confrontation and making the cat-caller uncomfortable publicly. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other, using loud heckling might escalate the situation. Some people might argue that it's a form of standing up against harassment, while others might say it's counterproductive. The author mentions that others think they're making it worse by drawing attention. \n\nBut the core issue here is whether the author's actions cross the line into being an asshole. The author is using a confrontational approach, which could be seen as taking the moral high ground. However, if it's done in a way that's disruptive or escalates the situation, maybe they are being an asshole. The question is about accountability. \n\nThe author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't been harmed, but threats are still threats. The key is whether the method is justified. If the author's intent is good but the method is causing more harm (like drawing attention to the cat-caller or making the situation more confrontational), then maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nBut if the method is effective in stopping the behavior and the author isn't directly causing harm beyond verbal confrontation, then maybe not. The line here is thin. The author's justification is that they want to create an atmosphere where others can step in. However, if their actions are seen as taking over or not allowing others to handle it, that could be an issue.\n\nIn terms of ethical perspectives, there's a utilitarian angle where the action's outcome matters. If the heckling stops the cat-caller, it's good. If it leads to more aggression or draws attention, it's bad. There's also a rights-based angle where people have the right to not be harassed. The author is trying to uphold that. \n\nBut the author's own enjoyment of the situation might be a red flag. If they're doing it partly for fun, that's problematic. The line between standing up for others and being a self-righteous jerk is blurry here. The fact that both men and women think they're an asshole suggests that their approach isn't well-received. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because their method could be counterproductive and they're using a confrontational approach without considering other perspectives. However, some might argue B (they're not in the wrong) because they're taking a stand against harassment. The key is whether the method is appropriate. Since the author's approach leads to threats and is seen as making things worse by others, it's more likely that they are in the wrong.\n"
