Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author moved to a big city and has been loudly \"booo!\"ing at cat-callers for two months. They do this because they're against cat-calling, and their intention is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. They get some backlash, like curses and threats, but no one has physically confronted them yet. Their friends and others think they're an asshole, with guys calling them a \"white knight\" (which I think means they're being overly chivalrous or trying to be a hero without understanding the situation) and women saying it makes the situation worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is about creating an environment where others also tell off cat-callers and maybe making it funny for themselves. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. The key points here are about the appropriateness of their response. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening seems like a good intention. However, the method they're using is public heckling. The question is whether that method is acceptable or if it's counterproductive.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop harassment, which is a positive intent. They are using a non-violent method, just vocal. On the other hand, their method might be seen as disruptive. The women's perspective is that it draws attention to the situation, which could make the victims feel more uncomfortable. For example, if someone is being cat-called, adding a loud \"booo\" might not just affect the harasser but also the victim, perhaps making them feel more exposed or embarrassed. Also, if the cat-caller is already making the victim uncomfortable, adding another loud response could escalate the situation, even if the intention is good.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. If the goal is to discourage future cat-calling, does public shaming of the harasser actually work? Maybe, but maybe not. Some people might be deterred, but others might become more aggressive. Also, the author's approach could be seen as taking the place of the victim in responding, which might not be what the victim wants. Some victims might prefer to be left alone and not have others draw attention to the harassment they're experiencing.\n\nAdditionally, the author's own admission that some people think they're an asshole suggests that their method is controversial. The \"white knight\" comment implies that they might be overstepping, trying to be a hero without considering the actual needs of the situation. The fact that they find it funny might also indicate that their approach is more about personal satisfaction than genuine concern, which could be seen as insensitivity.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their method could be making the situation worse for the victims, even if their intention is good. However, others might argue that any intervention against harassment is good, so the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But given the feedback they're receiving, especially from women, it's possible their approach isn't constructive. The key here is whether the method is appropriate. Public heckling might not be the best way to address the issue, so the author could be in the wrong because their actions, while well-intentioned, might have negative side effects.\n"
