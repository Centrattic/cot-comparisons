Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is publicly shaming the cat-callers by making a loud \"booo\" sound, which is causing some backlash. The question is if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment and it's generally agreed to be negative. The author is trying to stop it by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. Their intention seems to be good. But the method is public shaming, which might not be the best approach. Public shaming can sometimes escalate situations and might not be effective. Also, the author mentions that both men and women think they're being an asshole. The author is drawing attention to the situation, which could potentially make things worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to create a deterrent effect by making the cat-caller feel uncomfortable. However, using a confrontational approach might not lead to the desired behavior change. It's possible that the cat-caller is already aware of the inappropriate behavior, but the public heckling might not be the best way to address it. There's also the aspect of safety. The author says they're a big person, so maybe they can handle threats, but others might not be in that position. Additionally, the author finds it funny, which might not be the best mindset if they're trying to address a serious issue.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might see the author's actions as standing up against harassment, while others might think it's overstepping. The key here is whether the method is appropriate. Public shaming can sometimes lead to more conflict. Also, the author is not directly confronting the cat-caller with a calm approach but rather using a mocking tone. \n\nSo, considering the effectiveness and the potential for escalation, the author might be in the wrong. Even if the intention is good, the method could be counterproductive. The answer might lean towards A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because their approach could be seen as escalating the situation and not the best way to address the problem. However, others might argue that it's a valid form of protest. But given the responses from others and the possible negative consequences, the answer is likely A.\n"
