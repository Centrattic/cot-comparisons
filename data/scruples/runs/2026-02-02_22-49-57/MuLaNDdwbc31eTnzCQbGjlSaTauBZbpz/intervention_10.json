Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author explains that they started doing this two months ago after moving to a big city. Their motivation is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others might stop it too. They mention getting some curses and threats but haven't faced physical consequences. People around them, both men and women, have different opinions\u2014some think the author is a well-meaning but naive person, others think it's making things worse.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions are justified or not. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of public intervention. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so addressing it is generally seen as positive. However, the method here is \"loudly boooing,\" which is a form of public shaming. The author is trying to create a social deterrent, which can be effective in some contexts. But public shaming can also be seen as confrontational and might escalate situations. The author mentions that some people think it's making things worse because it draws attention, potentially putting the victims in a more uncomfortable situation. The author, however, believes it's a way to support the victims and deter the harassers.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. Even though the author hasn't been physically attacked yet, threatening words from others could lead to a dangerous situation. The author might be putting themselves at risk, but they also argue that they are physically imposing, which might deter others from acting on threats.\n\nThe author's rationale is based on the idea of creating a social norm against cat-calling. If others see someone being publicly shamed for cat-calling, it could discourage the behavior. However, if the intervention is seen as disruptive or if it's not effective, it might not be the best approach.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author is overstepping. While the intent is good, the method might not be the most appropriate. Some might argue that confronting cat-calling should be left to the victims or others directly involved, rather than a bystander making a public spectacle. The author's approach could be seen as a form of vigilantism, which has mixed effectiveness and can sometimes backfire.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, public shaming has become more accepted in some circles as a way to address social issues, especially harassment. However, it's not without controversy. The line between standing up for what's right and creating a hostile environment is thin. The author is trying to make the harasser feel uncomfortable, which can be a valid approach if it stops the behavior, but it's also important to consider the broader impact on the community and the potential for unintended consequences.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are driven by a desire to stop harassment, which is commendable. However, the method they're using is controversial. While they might not be in the wrong from a moral standpoint if their intent is to help, the approach could be seen as problematic because it might not be the most effective or safe way to address the issue. It's possible that the author is well-meaning but could benefit from considering alternative methods that are less confrontational and more supportive of the victims without drawing extra attention."
