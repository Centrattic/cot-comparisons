Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. They argue that their actions are to stop the behavior and discourage others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and unwanted. The author is trying to address it by publicly mocking the perpetrators. But some might say that responding with similar aggressive behavior escalates the situation. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to create a negative consequence for the cat-caller, which could potentially reduce such behavior. They mention that people around think they're an asshole, but they don't back down. The question is whether their method is justified.\n\nHowever, using loud heckling might draw more attention to the situation, which could make the victim uncomfortable. Also, the author is getting aggressive responses, which might lead to more conflict. Even though the author is physically capable, there's a risk of escalation.\n\nLegal aspects? Public heckling isn't illegal, but if it's considered harassment, maybe. But the author isn't targeting individuals beyond the moment. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might support the idea of peer pressure to stop bad behavior, while others think it's not their place to police others.\n\nThe author's own admission of hypocrisy (calling themselves a hypocrite) adds complexity. They acknowledge the problem but use a method that could be seen as part of the problem. Their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable, but does that justify their approach?\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might be counterproductive. It's possible the author is overstepping by becoming a public enforcer. So, maybe answer A (they're in the wrong) because their approach could worsen the situation despite good intentions.\n"
