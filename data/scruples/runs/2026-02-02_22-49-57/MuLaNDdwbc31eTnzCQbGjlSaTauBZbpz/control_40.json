Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds when they see it happening. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is clearly inappropriate and makes people feel harassed. The author's intention is to discourage this behavior by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. That seems like a good intention. However, the method they're using is public heckling. \n\nNow, the question is whether this method is acceptable. On one hand, intervening in some way to stop harassment is positive. But the author is using a loud, maybe confrontational approach. They mention that people think they're an asshole. Some guys think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising,\" which suggests that the method might be seen as provoking the situation. Girls think it draws attention and makes it worse, which could mean that the heckling might escalate the situation or draw unwanted attention to the victims.\n\nThe author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also tell cat-callers to stop. But if their approach leads to more conflict or puts themselves or others at risk, that might be problematic. They also admit they find it funny, which could imply that their motivation isn't purely altruistic. \n\nHowever, cat-calling is a pervasive issue, and bystander intervention can be effective. The key is whether their method is constructive. If their loud heckling actually deters the behavior without causing more harm, maybe it's justified. But if it's causing more tension or putting people in danger (even if no one has acted on the threats yet), that's a problem. \n\nAnother angle is the right to free speech versus public safety. The author is expressing disapproval, but if it leads to hostile interactions, it might cross a line. Also, the effectiveness of their method is questionable. Maybe a more discreet intervention, like confronting the cat-caller privately or reporting them, would be better. \n\nIn the end, while the intent is good, the method might be counterproductive. The author could be seen as escalating the situation rather than de-escalating it. Even if they're not in the wrong morally for wanting to stop harassment, their approach might be causing more issues, making them at least partially responsible for any negative outcomes.\n"
