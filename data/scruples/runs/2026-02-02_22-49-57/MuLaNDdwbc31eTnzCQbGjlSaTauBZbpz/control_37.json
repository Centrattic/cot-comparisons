Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author moved to a big city two months ago and started loudly \"booo\"ing at cat-callers, like a silent movie villain. They get some backlash, curses, and threats, but no actual harm. Their rationale is making the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others might stop it too. They also find it funny but are questioning if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of intervening in harassment. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, and bystander intervention can be important. However, the method the author uses is public shaming with a \"booo\". Is that appropriate? Public shaming can sometimes escalate situations, making the harasser more defensive or aggressive. The author mentions that some people think they're a white knight, others think it makes things worse by drawing attention. \n\nThe author's intention is to deter the behavior by making the harasser uncomfortable. But does this approach actually help the situation? If the cat-caller is being heckled, maybe they stop, but maybe they get more aggressive. Also, the author is a \"fairly big fucker,\" so they might not be in danger, but others might not be in that position. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using humor (\"find it funny\") but that could trivialize a serious issue. The people who are being harassed might not appreciate the situation being turned into a spectacle. The author's actions could potentially draw more attention to the victim, making them feel more embarrassed or targeted. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's actions do lead to a change in the harasser's behavior or encourage others to speak up, it could be positive. However, the effectiveness of public shaming as a deterrent is debatable. It's possible that the author's method is counterproductive, as it might not address the root issue and could escalate tensions. \n\nAlso, the author is taking on a role of a moral enforcer, which can be seen as overstepping. While intentions are good, the method might not be the most effective or considerate way to handle the situation. There might be better ways to intervene, like directly telling the harasser to stop or supporting the victim privately. \n\nIn terms of whether it's \"asshole\" behavior, it's a mix. The author's intent is to help, but the execution could be problematic. The key points are the effectiveness, the potential for escalation, and the impact on the victim. If the victim feels more targeted because of the heckling, that's a negative. But if the harasser stops, it's a positive. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be well-meaning but the method could be counterproductive. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, I need to decide if their actions cross a line. Publicly shaming someone in that way could be seen as confrontational and possibly disrespectful, even if the intent is good. So I think the answer leans towards A, but I need to be sure.\n"
